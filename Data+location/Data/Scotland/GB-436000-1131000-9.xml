		<content>      VERY FEW CROFTERS IN BURRA ARE   
 FULL TIME, MOST HAVING ANOTHER JOB    
 LIKE WORKING FOR THE COUNCIL, TAXI    
 HIRE OR FOR THE WOMEN, KNITTING. MOST 
 LIKE THE LAMBING TIME BEST AND THE    
 WEATHER WHEN IT'S FINE. MOST WANTED TO
 BE NOTHING ELSE BUT A CROFTER.        
 USUALLY THEY GET UP IN THE MORNING    
 BETWEEN 6.30 AND 8.00 A.M. MOST       
 CROFTERS NOW HAVE A LOT OF MACHINES TO
 WORK WITH AND IT IS A PROBLEM IF THEY 
 BREAK DOWN. ANIMALS ARE MOSTLY SHEEP, 
 THOUGH THERE ARE ONE OR TWO COWS AND  
 THERE ARE SOMETIMES GOATS.            
      THE BUSIEST TIME IS SPRING WHEN  
 THEY HAVE TO GET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF  
 THE NIGHT FOR LAMBING. MOST CROFTERS  
 EAT WHAT THEY PRODUCE LIKE POTATOES,  
 VEGETABLES AND OCCASIONALLY BUTTER OR 
 MILK. SOME SELL THEIR OWN LAMBS AND   
 BUY MEAT FROM THE BUTCHER INSTEAD OF  
 EATING THEIR OWN.                     </content>
