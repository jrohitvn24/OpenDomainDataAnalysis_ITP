		<content> Apart from fishing boats, cargo       
 vessels dock with cement, timber and  
 building supplies. Survey vessels do  
 research in the Atlantic Ocean to see 
 where rocks are so that other ships   
 can avoid the rocks, they also chart  
 the ocean. Fishery research vessels   
 search for shoals of fish then report 
 back to say whats happening to the    
 fish. There are{F.P.V.,  (fishery     
{protection vessels)}to patrol the     
 water to see that too much fish is'nt 
 caught, the F.P.V.s' that dock in     
 Stornoway are - the {JURA, SUILESGEIR,
{VALIANT}and the{MOIDART.}There are    
 pleasure craft including yachts, speed
 boats, rowing boats and canoes.       
 Stornoway has only a small yacht      
 population compared to other ports.   
 The navy use Stornoway as a last port 
 before Amarica. The{SULIVEN,}is the   
 local car ferry.                      </content>
