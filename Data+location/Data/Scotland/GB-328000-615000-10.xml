		<title>10ARTS AND CRAFTS,ETTRICK.</title>
		<content> This small area has surprisingly many 
 arts and crafts. While dressmaking,   
 knitting and crochet work are womanly 
 pursuits , stickmaking,painting and   
 pottery are undertaken by both men and
 women.                                
 There is a small market garden dealing
 mainly in dried flowers for the open  
 market and for the art of flower      
 craft.                                
 A small pottery nearby has a good     
 trade with the tourist industry and   
 with local shops. Two local artists   
 paint in all mediums and also sell in 
 and out of the area.                  
 Arts and crafts are geatly encouraged 
 by the Women's Rural Institute, who   
 encourage by holding regular classes  
 and competitions, and many old crafts 
 are handed down from generation to    
 generation.
