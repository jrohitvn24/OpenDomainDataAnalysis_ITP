		<title>15GOLFING IN EDINBURGH.</title>
		<content>   Edinburgh is regarded as one  of the
 golfing  centres of  the world.  It is
 thought  that  golf  actually  started
 just outside Edinburgh,in Musselburgh.
   There are some 21 courses within the
 city boundaries and  a  similar number
 within easy reach  of the city. One of
 these courses is the famous  Muirfield
 which hosts the Open Championships and
 which attracts  the best  players from
 all over the  world.  Amongst the most
 interesting  of  the  courses is Braid
 Hills,  run  by  the  corporation, and
 regarded as an excellent test of  golf
 by all those who play on it.          
   Murrayfield Golf Course  is situated
 on one side of Corstorphine Hill. From
 here there is a  spectacular  view  of
 Edinburgh Castle and Fife.            
   The  quality  of  these  courses has
 made Edinburgh the envy of the golfing
 world.                                </content>
