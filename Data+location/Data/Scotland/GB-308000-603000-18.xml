		<title>18A FUTURE FOR MOFFAT</title>
		<content>   The future of Upper Annandale in    
 general and Moffat in particular is   
 undoubtedly linked to a thriving      
 tourist industry which has its origins
 in the 1800's.Sadly,however,that      
 selfsame tourist industry has other   
 lasting,less positive effects on the  
 town.Once large families lived and    
 worked in the town.Now many young     
 people are forced to leave the town in
 search of Further Education or        
 fulltime employment.Many never return 
 or do so only to visit relatives.Many 
 of those who remain have seasonal work
 at best or unemployment at worst as   
 their only prospects.A high proportion
 of the population are elderly or      
 retired.A future without tourism?     
 Unthinkable.Employment,without        
 altering the town's character?        
 Improbable.A fine dilemma!
