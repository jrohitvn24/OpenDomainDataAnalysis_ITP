		<title>03EMPLOYMENT AROUND DRUMOAK</title>
		<content> Employment has changed radically over 
 the years in Drumoak due to increasing
 mechanisation and the discovery of    
 North Sea Oil.                        
 Mechanisation has meant that the      
 farming industry does not need  the   
 large labour force it once used.      
 Farmers now use only casual labour at 
 peak periods like harvest time and    
 some small holders even have other    
 full time employment.                 
 The oil industry has brought new jobs 
 to the area, engineers making up a    
 large part of the work force.         
 Despite this fact non oil-related     
 industries still employ the largest   
 number of people living locally,      
 mainly the building industry  and     
 other craftsmen, some of whom run     
 their own small businesses.           
 Unemployment is not common in Drumoak.
