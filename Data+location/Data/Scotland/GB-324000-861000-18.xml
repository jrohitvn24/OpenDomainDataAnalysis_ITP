		<content>    Lhanbryde is a{dormitory village.  
 Most of the people who live here work 
 elsewhere. Our survey of 126 of the   
 families in school showed that only 32
 parents worked inside our survey box. 
 131 worked outside it. Elgin was the  
 most common place for people to travel
 to work,followed by Lossiemouth.      
 Several{travel to work}in Aberdeen and
 some on the oilrigs of the North Sea. 
 The parent who works furthest away    
 works in London.                      
    Most of the parents who worked in  
 the "box" were employed in one of the 
 shops or public houses.               
    The{unemployment}rate for Lhanbryde
 is about 10.6%(1984 figures)          
    We asked our parents for suggest-  
 ions that would create more jobs. They
 thought of :- industrial estate, an   
 electronics / clothes factory and an  
 old folks' home.                      </content>
