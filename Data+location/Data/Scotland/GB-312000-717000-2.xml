 The River Earn flows in meander loops 
 through its flood plain which is about
 3kms wide.To the north is the volcanic
 outcrop of Moncreiffe Hill which has  
 cliffs facing south.The highest point 
 is Mordun Top at 221metres.           
  Glaciers widened the valley and the  
 receding ice deposited till in the    
 form of drumlins and kame terraces    
 against the edge of the hill.         
  The valley shows two levels of river 
 terraces giving evidence of changes in
 land and sea levels and the position  
 of former meander loops can be seen   
 clearly marked by levees.The lower    
 flood plain is completely flat and is 
 therefore very difficult to drain and 
 liable to flood.
