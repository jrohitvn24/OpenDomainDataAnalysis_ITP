		<title>01LOW LYING FARM LAND</title>
		<content> This area consists of low lying farm  
 land with undulating hills, the       
 highest point being only 31 mtrs.     
 The south west corner of the area is  
 covered by Kirkwall Airport (Orkneys  
 main airport).   Immediately east the 
 ground is rough grazing land, formerly
 part of the war-time air base of which
 the ruins of several buildings still  
 remain.   The rest of the area is     
 intensively farmed grassland, for     
 cattle &amp; sheep.   Many of the farms   
 being small holdings each about 1     
 kilometre apart.   The land south east
 of Whitecleaat Farm is a peat bog     
 where peat for fuel is dug, but this  
 area is now being drained ready for   
 cultivation.   The loch of Tankerness 
 in the east is a fresh water loch,    
 though it is little used for fishing  
 it is well stocked with trout.        
 Inganess Bay is a well sheltered bay  </content>
