		<content> The main industry is agriculture of   
 which the prime crop is soft fruit    
 with potatoes and cereal and cattle   
 and sheep rearing sharing in that     
 order.This year great tracts of land  
 were painted a bright yellow with the 
 flower of Oil Seed Rape. The summer   
 has been the wettest on record and the
 soft fruit harvest was approximately  
 two to three weeks behind time        
 resulting in heavy losses. The main   
 source of the extra labour needed to  
 pick the berries is the holidaymakers 
 from the industrial areas who have by 
 tradition had holidays to coincide    
 with fruit picking the lack of        
 flexibility of the cities' factories' 
 holiday periods meant that labour was 
 available at a time when the crop of  
 fruits such as strawberries and       
 raspberries were still not yet ripe.
