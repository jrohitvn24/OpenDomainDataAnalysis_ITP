		<title>17SHEEP FARMING BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content> Balquhidder and the surrounding area  
 has long been used for sheep farming, 
 grazing the sturdy black-faced sheep  
 of the Scottish Highlands, a breed    
 known to withstand even the toughest  
 winters. Suffolk sheep have more      
 recently been introduced to some      
 farms. Because winters have been known
 to be severe and spring can be late in
 coming, lambing is later here with    
 most lambs born in April. In June     
 shearing time brings out the best of  
 true community spirit with each farmer
 in turn helping his neighbours with   
 this task.                            
 Farming families who have lived in the
 Glen for generations and can trace    
 their families through a century or   
 two give the community a uniqueness.  
 The new resident is warmly welcomed by
 these gentlefolk who give of their    
 hospitality generously.               </content>
