		<title>09EMPLOYMENT IN ALVA</title>
		<content> The Island House is a film and video  
 workshop. One of its aims is to train 
 unemployed people to work with film   
 and video equipment so they have more 
 chance of getting jobs. The group     
 involved will also go out and film    
 things like the Mini Marathon and then
 form it into a video tape. The Island 
 House has a small{cinema}that seats   
 30-40 people. It is situated just at  
 the entrance to the Alva Glen. Small  
{engineering}firms provide some jobs in
 Alva,and the Alva{Industrial Estate}is
 expanding quickly. A small survey     
 showed that three quarters of Alva    
 residents work within 8 miles of their
 home. The rest travel to their work at
 places like Grangemouth,Edinburgh and 
 Glasgow.
