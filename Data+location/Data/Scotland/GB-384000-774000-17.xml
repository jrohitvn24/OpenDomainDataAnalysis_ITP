		<title>17LOCAL NEWS IN KINNEFF AREA</title>
		<content> Most of the news about Kinneff appears
 in a local paper{" THE MEARNS LEADER".
 Over the last few months we have been 
 mentioned several times. The people of
 Kinneff have been complaining that    
 there is not enough parking space at  
 the{Old Church}when there is a funeral
 there. It has been decided to enlarge 
 the parking space but some people feel
 it should be even bigger.             
{   Kinneff School}won the Rotary      
 Shield in a project about an imaginary
 new leisure centre. Mrs.Gammie and two
 pupils were presented with a shield   
 and a book token at a Rotary lunch at 
 the St.Leonard's Hotel, Stonehaven.   
{The church}is often in the news. A    
 local girl recently was married there.
 Another local boy, Martyn Sunter, took
 over as organist one Sunday because   
 the usual organist had a cycling      
 accident.                             </content>
