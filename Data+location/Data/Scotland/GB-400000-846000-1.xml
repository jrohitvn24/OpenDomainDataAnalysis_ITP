		<content> The block contains part of {Mintlaw}  
 village and all of {Longside}village  
 and the farmland between them.The two 
 villages are linked East to West by   
 the{River Ugie},one main road A950,one
 minor road via{Inverquhomery},and a   
 dismantled railway line.The ground    
 rises gently from the flooded plain of
 the{River Ugie}(25m above sea level)  
 to about 60m both North and South of  
 the river . The two villages provide a
 contrast. {Mintlaw}was originally a   
 planned village which has in the last 
 ten years been further developed as   
 the point of growth in {Central Buchan
 while the  village of {Longside}is    
 older and  has developed naturally.   
 Most of the land is farmed.It is      
 mainly arable with some beef cattle.  
 The main crops are barley,wheat and   
 potatoes and turnips.
