		<title>17Gas Terminal Dalgety Bay.</title>
		<content> In the early l98O's many residents of 
 Dalgety Bay were worried by the       
 proposed development of Shell/Esso's  
 liquid gas terminal at Braefoot Bay.  
 It was felt that the terminal would be
 an eyesore, the scenic view across the
 Forth would be spoiled by tankers     
 waiting to berth at the terminal,     
 there would be risk of explosion and  
 widespread pollution. There was such  
 strong feeling about the development  
 that petitions were raised and some   
 houses put up for sale. By siting the 
 terminal to the north of Braefoot     
 Point it cannot be seen from any point
 in Dalgety Bay. The terminal which is 
 linked by pipeline to Shell/Esso's    
 ethane cracking plant at Mossmorran   
 was officially opened in the autumn of
 l984.                                 
                                       
                                       </content>
