		<title>10Paula's Day in Markinch</title>
		<content> Markinch School has 200 pupils.We have
 a headmaster and an assistant head for
 the early years.There are 8 teachers  
 and visiting teachers for drama,art   
 and music.A typical day starts at     
 9:00am with our teachers reading us a 
 Bible story.Then we do our maths and  
 arithmetic.Sometimes we then go to    
 watch a television programme.When we  
 come back we discuss it with the      
 teacher.After interval we do an       
 English exercise.Sometimes after that 
 we have a spelling test.We sit in     
 groups.The noisy ones sit on their    
 own.At 12:45 we go home for lunch.At  
 1:45 pm we go into the school.We have 
 a film or maybe gym.Then teacher reads
 us a bit of our story called "The     
 Island of Blue Dolphins".At 3:15 we go
 home.
