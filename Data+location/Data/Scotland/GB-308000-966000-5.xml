		<content> The different methods of Travel in    
 Thurso are by train, bus, car, motor  
 cycle and bicycle. There are 3 trains 
 per day from Thurso to Inverness at   
 06.00, 12.00 and 18.00. The journey   
 takes four hours and may be from 2    
 minutes to many hours late because of 
 heavy snow. Housewives use the town's 
 bus service when shopping. Children   
 from outlying districts use buses to  
 come to school and after swimming     
 lessons at the Pool. Fleets of double 
 decker buses take workers to and from 
 Dounreay. Most bicycles are ridden by 
 children.  Nearly everyone owns a car.
 A Traffic Count taken at the junction 
 of Castlegreen Road and Scrabster Road
 showed that 347 cars, 8 bicycles, 3   
 motorbikes, 24 buses, 1 moped and 1   
 tractor passed in the morning rush    
 hour.                                 
                                       </content>
