		<title>01Introduction To Jedburgh</title>
		<content> Our area is mainly farmland dominated 
 by the country town of Jedburgh(pop.  
 approx.4000).This Royal Burgh has a   
 long history and is first mentioned in
 the 9th.century.It was important in   
 the past because of its proximity to  
 the Border and was the scene of much  
 strife.                               
  Jedburgh's main industry is now the  
 production of precision tools and     
 hacksaw blades and of secondary       
 importance a plastics factory and     
 smaller factories producing knitwear. 
 The town because of its situation on a
 main road North has many tourists for 
 whom it has much to offer such as     
 places of historical interest,        
 sporting activities a traditional game
 of Handba,and Callant's  Festival all 
 amid natural beauty.Many tourists     
 purchase Jethart snails.
