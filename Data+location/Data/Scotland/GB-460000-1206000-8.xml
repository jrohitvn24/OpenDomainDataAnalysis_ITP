		<title>08Hunter Smith - Butcher</title>
		<content> The butcher's shop is situated at the 
 centre of Baltasound at the head of   
 the Voe.It is the only one on the     
 island.They are open from half past   
 nine to half past five which includes 
 a dinner hour.They have quite a lot of
 after hours work  which is from seven 
 o'clock a.m.to nine o'clock p.m.it is 
 just preparation.The busiest day is   
 Saturday,the busiest time of year is  
 Winter.There isn't enough work for two
 but just a bit much for one.They      
 started the business in 1981.Pork     
 sells alright,everyone likes beef but 
 it is so expensive.Lamb doesn't sell  
 very well as everyone has their own.  
 The job just involves butchery, doing 
 their own slaughter and cutting up the
 meat. Some meat comes in from         
 Aberdeen. It is different on an island
 than in a city as there is a bigger   
 range of customers in a city.         </content>
