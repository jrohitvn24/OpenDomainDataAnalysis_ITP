		<title>14Employment - Kennoway</title>
		<content>  In the past Kennoway was a centre for
 the production of{linen}cloth and of{ 
{leather shoes.}Many people were,      
 therefore, kept in full-time          
 employment within the boundaries of   
 the village.                          
  Today, however, the story is very    
 different. The traditional industries 
 have long since gone and no new       
 industry has replaced them. All that  
 can be offered are a limited number of
 jobs within the service industries    
 that do, naturally, exist in any      
 community. Most people have to        
 travel to near-by towns to work and,  
 in some cases, to much further afield.
  Statistically, no figures are        
 available for Kennoway alone with     
 regard to unemployment, but for the   
 Levenmouth area (including Kennoway)  
 the figures show a rise from 12.9% in 
 May 1981 to 20.9% in May 1985.        </content>
