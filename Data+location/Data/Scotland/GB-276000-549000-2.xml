		<content> Hallow-e'en means "Holy Eve" and is   
 celebrated on the 31st of October.    
 After school finishes all the children
 run down to the village and visit each
 of the shops in turn. The shopkeepers 
 throw out money, sweets, nuts and     
 fruit. All the children scramble for  
 them and get as much as they can.     
 In the evening all the children go out
 guising. They dress up in funny       
 clothes, carrying turnip lanterns and 
 go to people's houses. When they are  
 asked in they entertain the people by 
 singing a song, reciting a poem or    
 telling a joke. Then they are given   
 sweets, toffee apples or perhaps a    
 small sum of money. By the end of the 
 evening all of the children have bags 
 full of good things to eat to take    
 home with them.
