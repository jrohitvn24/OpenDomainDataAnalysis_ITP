		<content> Every June,Law has a Gala Day.The     
 Queen and her court are chosen from   
 Law Primary School.The court consists 
 of a Page,3 Maids and a Champion.Every
 Gala Day we have fancy dress contests,
 on floats and on foot,led by a Pipe   
 Band.There is also a Majorette parade.
 When the fancy dress competitors have 
 paraded around Law there is a fair.   
 There are also stalls where they sell 
 books and food.There are competitions 
 like "Beat the Goalie" and side shows 
 where you have to knock down coconuts 
 with a ball,or throw a ball into a    
 bucket.There is a boxing competition  
 and a dancing display.There are races 
 for adults and children and medals are
 awarded to the winners.Small children 
 can ride on a Shetland pony.In the    
 evening there is a Gala Day Dance.The 
 Queen and her court are invited to    
 this.                                 </content>
