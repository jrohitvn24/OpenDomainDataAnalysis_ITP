		<content> Seven established residents from      
 abroad write their thoughts:          
{I am reminded of my childhood, of the 
{country in Cap-de-ville, Trinidad.    
 As an Italian I like the people's     
 friendliness, village size and lovely 
 country.                              
{My appreciation of the natural beauty 
{of the lush valley with its fine trees
{now equals that of my native Denmark.}
 The cleanliness and feeling of space  
 appeal and the encircling hills remind
 me of happy college days in Shillong. 
{The beautiful hills are in complete   
{contrast to the flood plains of the   
{Rhine and Meuse in the Netherlands.   
 Only 20 miles from the city it is a   
 tranquil,scenic environment where few 
 houses interrupt the vista.  Guyanese.
{It's like coming home to "Sleepy      
{Hollow" as Pietermaritzburg's known. I
{feel comfortable surrounded by hills. </content>
