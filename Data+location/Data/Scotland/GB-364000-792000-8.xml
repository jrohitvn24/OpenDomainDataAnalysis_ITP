		<title>08THE CHURCH IN STRACHAN</title>
		<content> Until comparatively recently there    
 were two{church buildings}but now     
 there is only one in use, belonging to
 the Church of Scotland.               
  In 1962 the parish was{linked with   
{Finzean;}in 1983{with Birse also.}One 
 minister,presently a woman,serves the 
 3 independently run parishes.         
{Membership}is about{150.}Attendance on
 a{Sunday}is about{20/ 30}and about    
{80/90 on Communion Sundays.}Attendance
 has been affected by the change in    
 housing and type of population. Many  
 older members retire to Banchory. The 
 outlying population has declined and  
 those in new houses may have no church
 connection. There are several people  
 affiliated to a variety of churches   
 and religions outwith the area. The   
 rites of passage  are still important 
 to the community and the church.
