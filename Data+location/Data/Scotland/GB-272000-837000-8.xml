		<content> Each week we have a visiting teacher  
 for P.E.                              
 Every fortnight we have a visiting art
 teacher.                              
     There is a little{public park     
 across the road from the school.At    
 lunch time we can go over to the park 
 and play football,or play on the      
 climbing frame,see-saw ,swings or     
 chute.Great care has to be taken      
 crossing the road as there are lots of
 lorries passing by on their way into  
 the quarry which is right next to the 
 school.                               
     At{lunch time,}we all stay for    
 lunch at school. Two people bring     
 packed lunches,but all the others have
 a school lunch.The lunches are cooked 
 at a town school and brought out to   
 Daviot.{They are very good!
