		<title>11TOURIST ACCOMODATION FORRES</title>
		<content> Forres offers a wide variety of       
 accomodation for tourists.In the      
 town itself there are nine hotels and 
 many guest houses.Several self        
 catering cottages are around Forres.  
 The Royal lounge bar displays a       
 collection of crests of RAF squadrons 
 donated by airmen from nearby Kinloss.
 Large hotels eg The Royal offer many  
 Facilities eg colour television and   
 lounge bar .They are quite expensive  
 though, charging between Â£17 and Â£20  
 per person per night.The guest houses 
 are cheaper (Â£7 to Â£10) per night but 
 offer only basic services ie bed and  
 breakfast.Self catering cottages and  
 chalets are fully equipped but guests 
 must do their own shopping and        
 cooking.  The advantage of renting a  
 cottage is that guests are free to go 
 away on day trips without being tied  
 to meal times.                        </content>
