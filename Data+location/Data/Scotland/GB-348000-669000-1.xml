		<title>01Farmland south of Haddington</title>
		<content> The block is predominantly a rural one
 with small areas of managed woodland. 
 The river Tyne flows through it. The  
 main land use is the growing of barley
 and to a lesser extent wheat. The     
 barley is malted locally before being 
 sent to breweries and distilleries in 
 Edinburgh and other Scottish areas.   
 The wheat is used for bread and       
 biscuit making. There are several     
 small herds of beef cattle within the 
 block. The cattle are mainly Aberdeen 
 Angus and Simmental crosses and       
 include several bulls. Cheviot sheep  
 are grazed during the winter months.  
 The population of the area are        
 farmers, farmworkers and their        
 families who live in isolated houses  
 or small groups of cottages. There is 
 one small village, no shops or public 
 houses, only one church and one public
 telephone box in the block            </content>
