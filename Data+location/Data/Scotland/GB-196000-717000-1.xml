		<title>01INVERINAN</title>
		<content> Inverinan is 4 miles from Dalavich.   
 Inverinan doesn't quite sit on the    
 banks of Loch Awe.There are 11 houses 
 in the area.The population of         
 Inverinan is 16 adults and 3 children.
 There are 2 cottages that are used for
 holidays.There is a river running into
 Loch Awe called the river Inan.That is
 one of the reasons why Inverinan was  
 built because there was a clean water 
 supply.Out of the 11 houses there is 1
 farm and 1 croft.There are a few      
 fields round about Inverinan.There are
 forest walks that start across the    
 road from my house.
