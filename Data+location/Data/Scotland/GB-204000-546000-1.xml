		<content> Part of an area designated by the     
 Regional Council as having a high     
 scenic value. The block is bisected   
 into the sea and the land mass. The   
 sea is the North Channel joining the  
 atlantic Ocean with the Irish sea and 
 separates by some 20 miles scotland   
 and Ireland. A depth sounding due West
 from this block is charted at 149     
 fathoms. The land, bordered by a rocky
 coastline, is partly pastoral,        
 undulating up to 400 ft and verdant   
 given over in the main to dairy       
 farming. Houses and farms are isolated
 but not remote and the population is  
 sparse. Agricultural emphasis is given
 to grass production for silage hay and
 grazing. Some barley winter wheat nd  
 potatoes are also grown. this coastal 
 strip benefits from the effects of the
 Gulf Stream and gives mainly mild     
 winters                               </content>
