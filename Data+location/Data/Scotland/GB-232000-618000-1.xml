		<content>    During the {20th. Century }several 
 private estates have been replaced by 
 local authority or privately owned    
 housing. Two estates remain as public 
 parks -{Belleisle and Rozelle.}All    
 that remains of{Castlehill Estate }is 
 owned by Ayrshire and Arran Health    
 Board who intend to build a hospital  
 on the site. The soil was good for    
 grazing and market gardening. There   
 remain 4 farms and 3 nurseries.       
   Local authority houses have been    
 built on{The Mount}at Castlehill. From
 here you can see over the town of Ayr 
 to the sea and the{Island of Arran.}  
 Near the town are many mansion houses 
 which are now used as hotels, boarding
 houses, a children's hospital, old    
 people's homes and Wellington Private 
 School.
