 The subjects at the two schools were  
 very similar.In the morning they did  
 ordinary work like maths,English and  
 reading,while in the afternoon they   
 did subjects such as drama,games,art  
 and work on their projects.           
{SPORT}                                
 The two schools strongly believed in  
 sport in one form or another.They both
 had gym once a week and games as well.
{EXERCISE}                             
 Pupils thought sport was good because 
 it helped to keep them fit and it gave
 them a break from school work,which   
 they were glad to get a rest from!    
{TEACHERS}                             
 Most of the teachers were female.There
 were 20 teachers at Culter and 7 at   
 Milltimber.
