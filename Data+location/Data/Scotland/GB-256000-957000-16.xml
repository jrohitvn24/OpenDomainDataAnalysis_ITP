		<content> A building which was once the old     
 school has become a large shop which  
 specialises in woollen and tweed goods
 and locally made craft articles.      
 The owner also weaves  a lot of his   
 own mterial using a foot operated     
 loom. Local ladies knit Aran or Lopi  
 sweaters for sale in the shop and many
 touring buses stop to look for authent
 ic Scottish woollen products, and are 
 not disappointed.                     
 A smaller shop in the village deals   
 with smaller items of craft work and  
 more especially pottery, glass and    
 jewellery. Both shops have some fairly
 expensive items of quality for sale,  
 but there are also many smaller items 
 which visitors can buy to take home as
 souvenirs.
