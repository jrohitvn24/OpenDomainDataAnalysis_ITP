		<content> Sanquhar Castle, which dates back to  
 the 12th Century, was originally a    
 square tower but a variety of masonry 
 styles suggests additions over the    
 centuries. The castle and courtyard   
 (167ft x 128ft) were approached along 
 a tree-lined avenue, which is still   
 evident today. A deep ditch protected 
 the gateway, and the walled meadow was
 the Deer park (the name of one of the 
 present day streets). There was a 42  
 foot deep well in the courtyard and a 
 skeleton found there long ago gave    
 rise to our local ghostly celebrity,  
 "The White Lady". In 1695, the Duke of
 Buccleuch (the occupant of the castle)
 moved residence to Drumlanrig Castle, 
 10 miles SE of town, and Sanquhar     
 Castle fell into disrepair. Only ruins
 of the castle now remain, although    
 some of its stone has been used in the
 construction of present day buildings.</content>
