 It may seem amazing to most people in 
 Britain but the main fuel used in our 
 area is peat.  Visitors to the area   
 tend to think that we just pick it up 
 of the hillside but there is actually 
 an awful lot of work involved before  
 the soft wet material most people know
 as peat, can become a hard, dry fuel. 
 Peat is made up of semi-decomposed    
 vegetable matter and is almost ninety 
 per cent water when in its natural    
 state.  The work of converting is done
 in several stages.  All crofters have 
 the right to cut peats on the hill and
 most take advantage of this, as       
 alternatives like coal are very       
 expensive.
