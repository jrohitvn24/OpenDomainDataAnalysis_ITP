		<content> "THE EAST KILBRIDE NEWS"              
    This is the name of the local news 
 paper.It was established in 1952 and  
 enjoys a wide circulation,describing  
 local events and successes,advertising
 and,of course,letters to the EDITOR.  
 "East Kilbride Angling Club are very  
 grateful to the "East Kilbride News"  
 for bringing to the attention of the  
 public the now serious pollution      
 problem on the River Calder.So far    
 this year there have been numerous    
 cases,the most serious occurring only 
 days after the river had been stocked 
 with 3000 trout.There are two culprits
 -a firm who let tons of diesel fuel in
 to the watercourse and a company who  
 discharged waste in the late evening  
 to avoid detection.The Angling Club   
 pay East Kilbride District Council a  
 rent for the River Calder--is the     
 Council ignoring POLLUTION PROBLEMS?" </content>
