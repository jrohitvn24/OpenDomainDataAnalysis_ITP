		<content> Muirland School is in the middle of   
 the country side.  Outside the        
 classroom window is a bird table.     
 Many tits come to feed on the nut bag.
 Blue tits and great tits are the most 
 common.  A coal tit comes as well and 
 occasionally a long tailed tit.       
 There are a lot of chaffinches and    
 some greenfinches too.   The robin is 
 often seen and sometimes comes into   
 the classroom. The wren is a shy      
 bird and stays in the bushes.  The    
 dunnock is shy too and feeds on the   
 ground.  Blackbirds and starlings also
 visit the bird table and sometimes a  
 thrush will come.   Last winter a     
 number of fieldfare  and redwing were 
 seen in the school playground.
