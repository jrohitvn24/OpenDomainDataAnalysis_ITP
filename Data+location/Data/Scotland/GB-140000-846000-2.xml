 Forestry is one of the few sources of 
 employment on Skye today and covers   
 a large percentage of the land area.  
                                       
 The main types are coniferous         
 especially the fir and pine varieties.
                                       
 These are planted in large plantations
 with large gaps separating sections of
 trees.  These are called fire breaks. 
 Only a small quantity of the timber is
 used for commercial use. This is due  
 to the high costs of transportation   
                                       
 Every ten years or so the trees are   
 thinned out giving them more room to  
 grow.This is a very time consuming and
 expensive occupation but has the      
 advantage of providing welcomed       
 employment to the local community.    </content>
