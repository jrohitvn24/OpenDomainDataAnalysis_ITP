		<title>06Changes on Threave Island</title>
		<content> A big change has been carried out on  
 Threave Island, since Threave Castle  
 was built on it, in 1369. The Castle  
 was owned by the third Earl of        
 Douglas, but now it belongs to the    
 National Trust of Scotland. The island
 used to be a place of noise and anger,
 but now it is a quiet ruin.           
 It has been discovered that an earlier
 castle lies underneath the grass, east
 of the later Douglas Tower house. No  
 work has been done to uncover this    
 hidden castle.                        
 Nowadays the moat is no longer filled 
 with water as it has been drained out.
 Threave Island stands in the middle of
 the River Dee and lots of tourists    
 come to visit the Island and Castle.
