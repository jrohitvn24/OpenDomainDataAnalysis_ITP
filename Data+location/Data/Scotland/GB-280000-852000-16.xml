		<title>16HEN HOUSE (GOLLANFIELD)</title>
		<content>   At{Gollanfield,}next to{Loch        
{Flemington}there are some{Battery Hen 
{Houses.}My friend's father works there
 First they take the chicks in when    
 they are very young,and they keep them
 there for quite a long time until they
 have grown and fattened up. Then a    
 lorry comes and takes them away.      
   Then they clean out the sheds and   
 take in new chicks.                   
  Since the chickens need to be kept   
 warm they have very big heating fans. 
  The chicken houses  were built in    
{1964.}There are{37,500 chickens}there 
 at the moment.Sometimes they get them 
 for their eggs.They feed the very     
 young chicks on{chick starter         
{crumbs,}when they are under six weeks 
    Then when they are  six to         
 eighteen weeks old they give them     
{pullet grower crumbs.}At last they get
 sold to various laying farms.         </content>
