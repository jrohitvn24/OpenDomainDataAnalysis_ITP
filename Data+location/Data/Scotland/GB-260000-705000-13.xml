 built this century but some 18th and  
 19th centurydwellings have recently   
 been modernised.Some of the{earliest  
{buildings exist}in part.The letter and
 barred window of the first P.O.may    
 be seen in Ancaster Square.Nearby,No.1
 has retained the marriage lintel.     
 Main St.----Milton House and Murdiston
 are 18th C.but many,like Kinnell House
 and the Ancaster Arms are Victorian.A 
 typical feature are walls of "plum and
 pudding"stone and{slate roofs.

 in Callander.The hotel dates from the 
 17th C.Ivy Cottage has the trademark  
 of its owner over the door and Acharn 
 has the McNab crest.                  
 In contrast the new Mollands estate

 techniques and designs,with roughcast 
 walls and tiled roofs.                </content>
