		<content> The main shop is a small family       
 business which includes a small super 
 market, grage, petrol pumps, coal     
 deliveries and calor gas supplies.    
 There are three vans which are        
 mobile shops to supply outlying areas 
 with goods, and there are three       
 lorries which fetch supplies from In  
 verness , take cattle or sheep to     
 markets, or do furniture removals.    
 There are twelve employees in the     
 business which makes it the biggest   
 local employer. There used also to be 
 a bakery but now wrapped sliced bread 
 is brought in twice a week by van. The
 mobile shops provide a costly but     
 necessary service to the many isolated
 crofts and houses in the  area.
