		<content>                                       
     In 1984 Mr. Millan took an        
 interest in building Bathgate a       
 Museum.   When the museum was under   
 way Mr. Millan paid us a visit as he  
 used to be a pupil here and then a    
 teacher, but now he is an Assistant   
 Headteacher at Redhouse, Blackburn.   
   When he came he showed us some of   
 the objects that he had in the        
 museum, which he had found or which   
 people had donated.   The objects     
 which distinctly stick in my mind are 
 a pair of old spectacles and some     
 lovely shaped bottles.                
      Now, one year later, the museum  
 is coming on well and more objects    
 have been donated.   This museum gives
 Bathgate another piece of interest and
 we are very grateful to Mr. Millan for
 planning and building the museum that 
 belongs to Bathgate.                  </content>
