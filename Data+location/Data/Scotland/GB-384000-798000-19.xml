		<title>19MARYC.SUPERNATURAL LADY</title>
		<content> Sir Godfrey Wedderburn was a Knight   
 Templar who fought in the Holy Land.  
 Badly wounded, he was devotedly nursed
 back to health by a Saracen lady. She 
 loved him but because of his vows he  
 could not marry her. She gave him a   
 ring with a small, bright stone, said 
 to protect him from danger. When he   
 returned to Maryculter she followed   
 him. When she was discovered the      
 Preceptor did not believe Godfrey had 
 kept his vow. He was ordered to kill  
 himself and plunged a dagger into his 
 breast. The Saracen maid dared the    
 Preceptor to wear the charm as a      
 witness to Godfrey's innocence. As he 
 did so a blinding flash and a bolt of 
 fire struck the earth and he vanished.
 The crater is known today as the      
 Thunderhole. The lady killed herself. 
 Dressed in green, she roams the       
 countryside.                          </content>
