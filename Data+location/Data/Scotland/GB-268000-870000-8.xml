 Oilseed rape is not the only new      
 feature of farming in this area, nor  
 is it the most significant. These are 
 perhaps the amalgamationof farms      
 through purchase into larger units:   
 for example Kincraig was once three   
 farms. The second is the combination  
 of mechanisation and the decline in   
 the workforce.Linked with this is the 
 appearance of farm contractors and    
 co-operation among farmers to purchase
 and share expensive items of          
 machinery.Mechanisation was not the   
 onlyreason for the decline in the     
 workforce - many left to work in      
 industry:the aluminium smelter or the 
 oil rig construction yards because of 
 the high wages.                       
 Farming in this area is modern,       
 efficient and generally prosperous.
