		<title>17EMPLOYMENT-TEENAGERS.</title>
		<content> Youth unemployment in Greenock is     
 above the national average,about 80%. 
 Many stay on at school hoping to      
 obtain more qualifications. Often     
 academic courses are unsuited to their
 needs. Schools are trying to introduce
 more vocational courses for the 16-18 
 group,e.g.Travel Agency Practice,     
 Introduction to Distribution. Other   
 courses deal with the changing pattern
 of society with its increased leisure 
 time. Unemployed teenagers also can   
 take part in the Youth Training Scheme
 run by the Manpower Services          
 Commission. This is aimed at giving   
 teenagers work experience and the     
 opportunity to learn the basic skills 
 of a trade. Many criticise the scheme 
 as a source of cheap labour and for   
 failing to create real jobs.          
 Unemployed teenagers only get         
 supplementary benefit,Â£18 a week.     </content>
