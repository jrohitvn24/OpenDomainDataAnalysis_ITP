		<title>15TRANSPORT AROUND SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   Transport is a problem in the       
 country. There are not many bus       
 services around Shawhead. The bus     
 leaves Shawhead at 8.20am and arrives 
 back at 4.20pm. The bus usually       
 carries school children and workers   
 but not shoppers.                     
   As public transport is not very good
 cars are vital. Bicycles are good for 
 the children to play on and go to     
 school on. They are handy if you are  
 stuck for transport.                  
   Most families have 1 or 2 cars.     
 Farmers are never really stuck for    
 transport as they have tractors, vans 
 and Land Rovers. Lots of farmers wives
 shop on a Wednesday when their        
 husbands are at the market in town.   
   The roads in winter are not very    
 good since we are high up and get more
 snow than the town. The back roads are
 not priority for snow ploughs.        </content>
