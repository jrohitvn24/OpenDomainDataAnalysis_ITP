		<title>11The Local Garages.</title>
		<content>                                       
 Crawford's position beside the A74    
 means that it is well provided with   
 garages.There are two garages in      
 Crawford.They are Weston's Garage and 
 South of Scotland Coachworks.Neither  
 garage has petrol,instead they provide
 a breakdown service for both cars and 
 lorries.                              
 Weston's Garage has several large     
 breakdown vehicles.They collect       
 vehicles which breakdown on the A74   
 and also vehicles which are involved  
 in accidents.They then repair the     
 vehicles in the garage.               
 As neither garage in Crawford has     
 petrol,people in Crawford have to go  
 to Abington(3 miles away)if they wish 
 to buy petrol.
