 AT ONE TIME THE GAELIC LANGUAGE WAS   
 SPOKEN IN MOST OF THE HIGHLANDS OF    
 SCOTLAND.GAELIC WAS TAUGHT TO THE     
 INHABITANTS BY INVADERS FROM IRELAND. 
                                       
 GRADUALLY THE USE OF THE GAELIC       
 LANGUAGE HAS BECOME LESS              
 WIDESPREAD.THIS WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE 
 INFLUENCE OF THE ENGLISH ESPECIALLY   
 AFTER THE CLANSMEN WERE DEFEATED      
 DURING THE 45 REBELLION.              
                                       
 NOWADAYS GAELIC IS SPOKEN MAINLY IN   
 THE NORTH AND  WEST COAST OF SCOTLAND.
 THERE ARE HOWEVER A FAIRLY LARGE      
 NUMBER OF NATIVE SPEAKERS IN THIS     
 BLOCK.
