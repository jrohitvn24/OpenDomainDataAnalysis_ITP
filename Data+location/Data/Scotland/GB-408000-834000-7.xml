		<content> The oldest part of Slains Castle was  
 built in the 16th Century. It was on  
 the cliff top for defence. The owners 
 were the Earls of Erroll, the Lord    
 High Constables of Scotland. The      
 castle grew bigger and bigger as the  
 years passed because parts were added 
 on to it by successive Earls. The roof
 was taken off in 1927. All the        
 furniture had been taken out and much 
 of it sold by 1923. The Castle is now 
 in ruins but people come to visit it  
 from all over the World. Its main     
 claim to fame is that it inspired Bram
 Stoker to write the Dracula story. He 
 was staying at the Kilmarnock Arms    
 Hotel at the time.                    
        The oldest part of the village 
 is made up of granite built houses,   
 while the two newer Estates consist of
 wooden Norwegian type houses and other
 built of 'breeze blocks'.             </content>
