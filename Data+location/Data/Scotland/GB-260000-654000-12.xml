		<title>12Pupil Opinions of E Kilbride</title>
		<content> ....East Kilbride is a brilliant place
 to live. There are so many different  
 things to do for the young and elderly
 alike. The town is clean and tidy with
 good shops near one's home as well as 
 an excellent Town Centre shopping area
 which makes it a popular attraction   
 for visitors. It is a happy place.    
 ....There is plenty to do. We have :- 
 sports centres, swimming baths, a lot 
 of swingparks and open grassland, a   
 nature trail and country park, three  
 golf courses, many football, rugby and
 hockey pitches as well as many indoor 
 youth clubs, discos etc.              
 ....Some of the things not so good :- 
 vandalism, rubbish being dumped in the
 open countryside or in some of the    
 small burns in the area, insufficinet 
 soundproofing in terraced houses and  
 flats, air pollution from industry, no
 professional theatrical shows or galas</content>
