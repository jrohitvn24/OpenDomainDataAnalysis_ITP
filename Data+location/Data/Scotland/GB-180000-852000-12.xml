		<content>   MY GRAN WORKS IN THE HOTEL AND SHOP.
  SHE WORKS FROM NINE O'CLOCK UNTIL    
 FIVE O'CLOCK.   SHE ALSO DOES BED AND 
 BREAKFAST.   SHE IS ALWAYS BUSY.      
   SOMETIMES I STAY AT MY GRAN'S AT THE
 WEEKENDS.   SHE HAS FIVE              
 GRANDCHILDREN.   SHE COLLECTS STAMPS  
 AND GIVES SOME TO HER GRANDCHILDREN.  
 I HAVE THE MOST BECAUSE I AM THE      
 OLDEST.                               
    SHE HAS SIX CHILDREN OF HER OWN.   
 FIVE OF THEM LIVE IN THE VILLAGE AND  
 MY AUNT HAS JUST COME BACK FROM A     
 HOLIDAY IN SYDNEY.                    
    THE TREE IN FRONT OF MY GRAN'S     
 HOUSE HAS JUST BEEN CUT DOWN BECAUSE  
 IT WAS MOVING.                        
    EVERY MORNING  WE STOP AT MY       
 GRAN'S ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL AND SHE   
 GIVES US A PLAY-PIECE.
