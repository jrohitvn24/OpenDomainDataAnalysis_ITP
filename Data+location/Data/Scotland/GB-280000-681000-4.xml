		<content>{Local Councils}provide one of the main
 sources of employment in this area.   
 Many people are employed in house or  
 road maintenance, gardening or refuse 
 collections. Small businesses, set up 
 by people who have taken part in      
 retraining schemes, have been opening 
 up in disused buildings in the town.  
 These buildings have been converted   
 into small work units and are rented  
 out on a month to month basis. One    
 such enterprise, known as the {DENNY  
{WORKSPACE,}has room for 17 workshops. 
 Here the new businesses offer a range 
 of high technological products. In the
{GRANARY}new firms offer a service to  
 the public eg. shoe repairing, car    
 maintenance. Seven women, known as the
{Duncarron Spinners,}have formed a     
 workers' cooperative. They produce all
 kinds of knitwear which they hope to  
 sell in Britain and overseas.         </content>
