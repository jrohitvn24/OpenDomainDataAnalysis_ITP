		<title>05Changes in Linlithgow</title>
		<content>    To get the information we          
 interviewed four people: Mr Lawson-the
 headmaster,Mrs Reville,Mrs Farmer and 
 Mr McMeechan.                         
    In the 50's Linlithgow was only a  
 small town but in the 60's things     
 started to change.First the old houses
 from the Vennel to the Cross were     
 demolished and new council flats were 
 built.Then they started to build new  
 private estates all round Linlithgow. 
 This building continued right through 
 the 70's and is still going on today. 
  "Things are much faster today and    
 there is lots more to do,"said Mrs    
 Reville, comparing life in the 50's to
 life today.                           
   Mr McMeechan commented,"Linlithgow  
 is a very nice town,steeped in history
 and it is a nice clean place to live  
 in."
