		<title>01Newburgh And The Local Area</title>
		<content> This is a rural area where farming    
 dominates the landscape.The land is   
 generally flat with only a few gentle 
 slopes the highest point being 61     
 metres above sea level.As it is also a
 coastal area there are very few       
 trees.Part of the river Ythan flows   
 through this area before it reaches   
 the North Sea.Since the land is used  
 mainly for farming there are only two 
 villages Newburgh and Tipperty.       
 Newburgh which has grown in size over 
 recent years.Tipperty which has       
 remained fairly small.There are 11    
 farms within this area.               
 The main Aberdeen Peterhead road the  
 A92 passes through the area.The       
 Newburgh Pitmedden road the B9000     
 joins up Newburgh with the main A92.  
 The oldest buildings are the Krypt    
 built in 1300 and Knockhall Castle    
 built in 1565, both are in Newburgh.  </content>
