		<content> Carnock probably got its name from    
 Caer- a fort and Knock - a hill and   
 dates from Pre- Roman times.          
 The old ruined church dates back to   
 the eleventh century and has a Pre-   
 Christain Pictish stone set in one    
 wall. The oldest gravestone is dated  
 1623 . There used to be a grain mill  
 which is abandoned in 1885 when it    
 became uneconomic.                    
 People who lived in Carnock about     
 fifty years ago were mainly farm      
 workers or miners who worked at       
 Bogside mine.Nowadays most resideuts  
 travel  to work elsewhere.            
 At one time Carnock had about twenty  
 three hostelries but now it has only  
 one. It is the Old Inn and is dated   
 around 1700.Nowadays five to six      
 hundred people live in Carnock-  some 
 in new houses recently built.
