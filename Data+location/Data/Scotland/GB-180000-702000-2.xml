		<content>   Water. Mains water (from a hill     
 loch) to all but one of the houses    
 with in the N.W. section of the block 
 (but not far beyond, where house      
 holders rely on their own private     
 supply from springs, burns or lochs). 
   Electricity. All dwellings now have 
 mains electricity but due to frequent 
 power failures most householders have 
 alternative cooking, heating &amp; light- 
 ing equipment.                        
   Sewerage.New planning applicants are
 required to install septic tanks but  
 raw sewage still goes into the loch!  
   Roads. (No pavements/ street        
 lights). Heavier traffic = roads need 
 regular upkeep. (Heavy rain can cause 
 blocked culverts, then flooding!)     
   Refuse. Weekly collection.          
   Police/Ambulance/Fire Brigade. All  
 15 miles away. But village 'volunteer'
 firemen on (24 hour) call.            </content>
