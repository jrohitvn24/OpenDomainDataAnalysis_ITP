		<content> This part of Eastern Scotland is a    
 very fertile farming area, with cereal
 crops and potatoes predominating. The 
 population within the area is,        
 accordingly, thinly spread. Although  
 there are two small villages, much of 
 the population lives in               
 farmhouse/cottage accomodation, since 
 some 70% of the population has        
 agriculture related employment. The   
 surrounding countryside is gently     
 rolling, but the cones of long extinct
 volcanoes, together with many strips  
 of hardwood trees break up the        
 landscape. Because we are near the sea
 (3km), and sheltered from the worst of
 the North and West winds, the winters 
 are fairly mild, and the growing      
 season long for this latitude.
