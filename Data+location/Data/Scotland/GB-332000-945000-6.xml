		<title>06The Village Hall</title>
		<content> The village hall was erected to       
 commemorate those who died in the     
 first World War.                      
 It has kitchen and toilet facilities  
 and was renovated and brought up to   
 modern safety standards in the mid-   
 nineteen seventies.                   
 It is in constant use and has the     
 services of a part-time hallkeeper.   
 The Rifle Club and Womans Rural       
 Institute,both organisations which are
 still very active in the village,have 
 longest associations with the hall.   
 Other clubs have come and gone but    
 today there is a Play Group,set up in 
 1977 and run by local mothers;a Sports
 Club which began in Feb.1984 and      
 caters for all ages and most recently 
 a Keep Fit Class.The hall is used for 
 a variety of village activities e.g.  
 Concerts,Discoes,Parties,Meetings,    
 Presentations and even Weddings.      </content>
