		<title>09Dennistoun Festival, 1985</title>
		<content> This year sees the ninth Dennistoun   
 Festival. This was inaugurated to     
 ensure the continuation of the        
 separate identity of Dennistoun and   
 its environs. The founders felt there 
 was a danger of the community being   
 absorbed into surrounding districts.  
 This Festival is truly a community    
 affair. All ages and sexes take part  
 with events which run the gamut from a
 Bonny Baby Competition to a           
 Pensioners' Concert.                  
 In all, there are some thirty events, 
 covering sport, beauty competitions,  
 folk music, pets' competitions,       
 puppetry, disco dancing, Kung Fu and  
 Dragon dancing.A Festival service was 
 held in a local church.               
 Funding came from local sponsors.     
 Local radio and shops helped with     
 advertising.
