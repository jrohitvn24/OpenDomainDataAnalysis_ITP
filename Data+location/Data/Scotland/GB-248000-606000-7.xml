		<content> The Dalmellington-New Cumnock road    
 (B741) passes near the terraced houses
 and latterly there was a regular bus  
 service on the route.  This brought   
 Dalmellington within a few minutes    
 journey.  For a time there was a      
 mobile shop.  The children went to    
 their own school.                     
                                       
 Mr Ireland's account and others say   
 that life in the 'rows' was often     
 happy. The houses lacked modern       
 amenities and were often overcrowded. 
 This was offset by a willingness to   
 co-operate with and help each other.  
                                       
                                       
 All that remains now are some ruins   
 and the memories of those who used to 
 live in High or Low Pennyvenie and    
 elsewhere in the Cummock Valley.
