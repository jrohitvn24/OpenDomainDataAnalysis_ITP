		<content>{Gala Day.}This takes place in June.   
 The Gala Queen is a girl from one of  
 the primary schools. She and her      
 attendants, all in fine costumes,     
 parade through the town in decorated  
 floats. All primary school children go
 and are given bags of good things to  
 eat, drinks and ice-cream. It is great
 fun.                                  
{Hallowe'en.}We have a party at school.
 Everyone dresses up as witches,       
 warlocks or something mysterious. We  
 dook for apples, eat clootie dumpling 
 and play games. After school, many of 
 us go out{guising.}We go round houses 
 singing and dancing and are given     
 apples, nuts and money. We wear our   
 fancy clothes.                        
{Hanselling.}When a new baby is taken  
 out for the first time, people give   
 the child a silver coin, say 50p, for 
 luck.                                 </content>
