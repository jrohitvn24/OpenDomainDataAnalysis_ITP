		<title>14GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> The 6-14 age group of children have a 
 variety of games which they play in   
 the playground and around their       
 homes.In Spring the main attraction   
 for boys is football, and older girls 
 may like to join in this.The favourite
 games are the different forms of tig  
 which involve one or more catchers    
 e.g.chain tig where the children join 
 hands when caught and run about in a  
 line;hospital tig where they hold the 
 part of the body touched by the       
 catcher;aeroplane tig where they stand
 with arms outstretched when caught but
 can be freed by someone running under 
 their arms.Other games are Hounds and 
 Hares,Hide and Seek,Rounders and      
 Marbles.
