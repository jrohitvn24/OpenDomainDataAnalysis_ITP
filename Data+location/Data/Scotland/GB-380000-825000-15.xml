		<title>15Concern-Oldmeldrum Housing</title>
		<content> Meldrum and Bourtie Coummunity Council
 have made a stand to prevent          
 uncontrolled housing development in   
 Oldmeldrum, based on Grampian Region's
 projected need up to the year 2001.   
 The 1980 Aberdeen area Structure Plan 
 gave Oldmeldrum responsibility of 300 
 more houses by 1991, without          
 supportive infrastucture.  Meldrum and
 Bourtie residents protested at a pubic
 meeting but the figure was not        
 changed.  The 1985 Structure Plan now 
 forecasts 750 additional houses for   
 Oldmeldrum by the year 2001.  The     
 Community Council has indicated to    
 Gordon District that it will accept no
 more than 350.  It presents among its 
 reasons the fact that when the        
 oil-related industry wanes Oldmeldrum 
 will have too many derelict structures
 on its hands.                         
                                       </content>
