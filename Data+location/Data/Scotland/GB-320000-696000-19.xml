		<title>19AUCHTERDERRAN</title>
		<content> In the south west of this ' D ' block 
 is the northern part of the           
 settlement of Auchterderran. This     
 small town is linked to Cardenden     
 which lies to the south of            
 Auchterderran.{Both settlements}have  
 been closely{associated with coal     
{mining}in the past but, like          
 Kinglassie in the north-east of the   
 ' D ' block,{mining activities have   
{ceased.   }                           
 The bulk of Auchterderran which lies  
 within this block is purely           
{residential,}especially the suburb of 
 Woodend in the north-west of the town.
 The main public building is           
{Auchterderran Junior High School }    
 catering for children between the ages
 of 11/12 and 15/16. Pupils wishing to 
 stay on for 5th and 6th year work have
 to travel to Beath High School in     
 Cowdenbeath, 5 kilometres away.       </content>
