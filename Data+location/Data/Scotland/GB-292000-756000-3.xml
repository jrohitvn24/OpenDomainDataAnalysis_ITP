		<content> "Without tourism Pitlochry would not  
 exist"                                
 The above comment was made by the     
 local tourist officer as he explained 
 the attractions of Pitlochry : a nice 
 Highland town .                       
 Visitors come from all over the world 
 ,though a large percentage are        
 Americans .From a street survey ,it   
 would appear that in the early part of
 the season most are just passing      
 through on bus journeys, or here for  
 short stays.                          
 Most of the town is given over to     
 providing accommodation for the       
 invasion of tourists - either private 
 houses providing"B+B"or the many      
 hotels and guest houses providing     
 between 2000 to 2500 bed spaces .The  
 Atholl Palace is the visitor's first  
 sight of Pitlochry, though cost means 
 a drive to the  humble caravan site.  </content>
