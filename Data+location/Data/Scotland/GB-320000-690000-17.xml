		<content> The early years of their marriage     
 were fraught with money worries. These
 worries did not disappear until       
 Carlyle published his "History of the 
 French Revolution"(some of which was  
 written in Auchtertool) and gained    
 popularity and wealth.                
 Carlyle went from success to success  
 until his wife died suddenly in 1866. 
 Carlyle never recovered from her death
 and although he lived another 15      
 years, he became weary, bored and a   
 partial recluse.
