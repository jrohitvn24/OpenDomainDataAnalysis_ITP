		<title>13Towie Pipers (Pipe Band)</title>
		<content> Pipers leading Scottish Regiments into
 battle terrified enemies.Now they play
 at ceremonial occasions.Gordon        
 Highlanders traditionally swell ranks 
 with local men.So an army piping      
 instructor gives chanter lessons at   
 Towie School,part of a programme to   
 promote the playing of bagpipes in the
 North East.As this instrument demands 
 dedication,only 1/10 become good      
 players.Towie Band results from       
 a piping evening class,started at     
 Towie School fourteen years ago by a  
 local person who's pupil became band  
 leader when it was formed four years  
 ago.The proceeds of fund raising      
 concerts bought the necessary         
 equipment for the fifteen members.They
 feel slightly disadvantaged as large  
 numbers produce the most rousing sound
 They are a popular attraction soon to 
 be joined by new young pipers.        </content>
