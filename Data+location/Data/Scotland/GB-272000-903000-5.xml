		<content>  I live ion a seventy year old stone  
 croft house. Eight years ago, a       
 kitchen extension was built. In the   
 kitchen, there are cupboards, a       
 fridge, table, chairs, couch,         
 telephone, sink and Rayburn. About    
 fifteen years ago a bathroom extension
 was built.                            
  In the sitting-room, there is a peat 
 fire. My house contains another five  
 rooms. Outside, there are lots of     
 sheds where the dogs and implements   
 are stored.                           
  My house is a semi-detached council  
 house in the village of Rogart. It has
 a small kitchen containing cupboards, 
 fridge, cooker and washing-machine.   
  In the sitting-room there is a peat  
 and coal fire. My house has another   
 three rooms. Outside, there is a small
 shed for keeping odds and ends.
