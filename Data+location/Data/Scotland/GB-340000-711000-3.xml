		<title>03Derivation: Ceres,Pitscottie</title>
		<content>   The  origin  of  the name  Ceres  is
 uncertain.   It could have  originated
 from  Roman  invasions  because  it is
 identical to the name  of the  Goddess
 of Harvest.   In the early seventeenth
 century it was 'Seres' and before that
 it was 'Syres'.  It may have come from
 the Latin word 'Syrus' meaning 'marshy
 ground  near  a  running  stream.'  It
 could also have been  named  after St.
 Cyrus or the Syras family.            
                                       
                                       
  A local legend suggests that the name
 'Pitscottie'  might   have  originated
 from a  Gaelic word which sounded like
 'Pitscottie' and  meant 'The land with
 the  little flock'.   Some  non-Gaelic
 speakers heard this word  and  thought
 it was the name of the hamlet.
