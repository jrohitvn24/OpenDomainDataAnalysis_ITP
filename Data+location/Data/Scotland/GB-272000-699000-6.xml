		<content> "Our house was built in 1897. It is a 
 little bit small; when you are in     
 the kitchen it gets a bit crowded."   
 Alisdair                              
 "My house is a very big, old house. It
 has lots of sheds used for pheasants. 
 My dad has to look after 500 pheasants
 every summer". Deanne                 
 "The people who lived in my house     
 before us kept cows in the kitchen".  
 Geoff                                 
 "We have quite a few posters up in our
 bedroom mainly of WHAM!" Laura        
 "Under my window is a heater and in   
 winter I will sit beside it and read  
 or listen to music". David            
 "My little brother's bedroom wallpaper
 has mice and rabbits with fat stomachs
 sleeping in wine glasses with the     
 words 'Go to sleep' on top". John-Paul
