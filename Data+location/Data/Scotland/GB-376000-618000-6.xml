		<title>06TYPES OF SHEEP AROUND HOWNAM</title>
		<content> The main type of sheep that graze     
 around Hownam in the Scottish Borders 
 are the grey face,a cross between the 
 Scottish black face ewe and the blue  
 headed Leicester tup. These highly    
 prolific ewes,crossed mainly with the 
 Suffolk tup,produce large numbers of  
 lambs,most of which are sold fat at   
 local marts. There are North and South
 country cheviots too,which bred pure, 
 produce ewe lambs,some to be retained 
 as stock and the surplus  sold to be  
 crossed later with Border Leicester   
 tups,producing the Scottish Half Bred,
 traditionally the finest of all low-  
 land ewes.The male lambs are mostly   
 sold at store and fat-stock marts,and 
 a few of the best kept as tups to be  
 sold for breeding or commercial use.  
 Though unpopular with modern farmers, 
 the meat and wool of North Country    
 Cheviots is of the hughest quality.   </content>
