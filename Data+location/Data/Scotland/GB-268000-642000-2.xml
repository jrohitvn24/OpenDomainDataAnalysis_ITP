		<content> An example of this is the Kirklandpark
 Hotel.When the building was first     
 constructed it was inhabited by a     
 wealthy owner;unfortunately it was    
 burned down by an unexplained fire.It 
 was rebuilt and nowadays is a Hotel   
 and Recording Studio.Previous         
 occupants who died in one of several  
 fires have been spotted in their      
 ghostly apparitions,they are however  
 reputed to be harmless.Some of the    
 ghosts have been "identified" as a    
 gardener,gamekeeper,child in Victorian
 costume and a dark haired lady with   
 manly features.They have been seen    
 both in the building and in the       
 surrounding grounds.                  
      A woman was walled up in the     
 local castle for some misdemeanour and
 haunts it.Her skeleton was recovered  
 by workmen a century or so ago,but of 
 course all castles have this story.   </content>
