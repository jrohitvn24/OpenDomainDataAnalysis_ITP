		<title>17FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> A family in Kirkmichael with 2 sons,  
 one 10 year old and one 1 year old,   
 enjoys a Sunday together as one parent
 usually works on the other six days of
 the week. A typical Sunday for this   
 family starts by getting up at 9a.m.  
 and having a leisurely breakfast. One 
 parent and the elder son go to the    
 village church and afterwards the     
 whole family often goes to a hotel in 
 Maidens for a bar lunch. In the       
 afternoon father and elder son visit  
 Maybole swimming baths. After an      
 evening meal about 6p.m. the family   
 watches television until bedtime.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
