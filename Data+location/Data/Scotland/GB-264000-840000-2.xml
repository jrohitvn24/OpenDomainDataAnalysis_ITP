		<content>    On Thursday, 20th June, 1985, we   
 looked through the local newspapers   
 to choose a few items of local        
 interest.                             
   {SCOUTING}and{GIRL GUIDES}are       
 popular in Inverness and last weekend 
 the{CHIEF SCOUT,MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL 
{WALSH}visited Inverness. All the local
 cubs and scouts were at{CAMERON       
{BARRACKS}to demonstrate their skills. 
    In the{QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY HONOURS    
{LIST,Mr. Russell Johnston}who has been
 M.P. for Inverness for 21 years       
 representing the{LIBERALS,}and whose  
 family attended our school, was       
 knighted.                             
    The new{GOVERNMENT TRANSPORT BILL} 
 is causing a lot of worry to people in
 the rural areas of the Highlands. Few 
 of these routes make a profit and some
 may have to close down.
