		<title>15Employment in Inchnadamph.</title>
		<content> There are{19 people}living in         
 Inchnadamph.{1:3}is the ratio of      
 children to adults.{10%}of the        
 population are fully retired. The     
 biggest employers are the Estates and 
 the hotel. The{Estates }employ 1      
 gamekeeper and 1 shepherd while the   
{hotel}employs about 10 people in the  
 summer. Tourism is therefore very     
 important and there are three holiday 
 homes  and one "bed &amp; breakfast" house
 and one caravan to let. Holiday homes 
 are cleaned out by local women. In the
 summer also there is  more passing    
 trade eg.hikers, cyclists and campers.
 Most depopulation here took place     
 during the{"Clearences" of 1812-1819  
 when{143 people}(sub-tenants) were    
 relieved of their land to make way for
 sheep. Population in{1774 was 79,}in  
{1811 was 169,}in{1841 was 26,}in{1861 
{was 19 }and in{1881 was 32.           </content>
