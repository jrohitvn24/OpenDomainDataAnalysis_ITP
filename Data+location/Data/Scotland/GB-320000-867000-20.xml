		<content>   When he arrived at the loch it was  
 covered in thin ice. The ice was thick
 enough to stop the ferry but too thin 
 to hold a man. After a dispute with   
 the ferryman, Robert told his coachman
 Alexander Philip to drive across the  
 ice saying, "dinna turn yer heid man  
 or the deil will drown us baith". The 
 coachman scared stiff, his eyes fixed 
 on shore, he daren't breathe.         
   When they were close to shore       
 curiosity took over from fear, the    
 coachman turned his head and saw a    
 monstrous black raven perched on the  
 Laird's shoulder. The raven saw the   
 coachman and flew out of the carriage.
 At that moment the ice gave way and   
 the carriage sank to its axles. The   
 coachman could never repeat the oath  
 that his master swore.
