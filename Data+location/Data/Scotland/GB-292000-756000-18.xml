		<content>  Miss Forbes is a person who has spent
 the whole of her life in Pitlochry and
 has of course seen many changes: not  
 always for the better.                
  Pitlochry has always been a tourist  
 centre, but in Miss Forbes' youth     
 there were few foreigners and most of 
 the hotels had stables, as cars       
 weren't much use on the poor, twisty  
 roads.                                
  The town used to have a much more    
 varied selection of shops, including  
 three drapers, tailors, dressmakers,  
 three butchers, three shoe shops etc. 
 Farming was the area's life blood.    
  In contrast, Miss Dyer, a school     
 teacher from York, retired to         
 Pitlochry, returning to the area of   
 her childhood. Apart from the obvious 
 scenic attractions, she appreciates   
 the work of the local doctors and the 
 presence of the Cottage Hospital.     </content>
