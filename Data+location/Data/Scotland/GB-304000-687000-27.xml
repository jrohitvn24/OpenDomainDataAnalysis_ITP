Our school has 4 classes and 90 pupils. In 2003 it became a joint headship where the headteacher oversees Milesmark and Wellwood school.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Curriculum for Excellence is being implemented which aims to transform education in Scotland. We have accreditation for Health Promoting Schools and Boardmaker and we are working towards accreditation for Eco and Rights Respecting Schools. &lt;br />&lt;br />Our playground has a wooden trim trail and other equipment and the garden is being developed by pupils and parents.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
