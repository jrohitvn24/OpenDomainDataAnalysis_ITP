		<content> On this page is explained the origin  
 of the place names of some of the     
 districts of Paisley and Glasgow and  
 what these areas are like now.        
{TODHOLM}was the " Field of the Fox"   
 though a holm was originally an islet 
 or a field with water on at least two 
 of its sides. This is now a busy road 
 with council housing on either side.  
{HUNTERHILL}is probably so called      
 because the Steward's chief huntsman  
 lived there.It is now a council       
 housing scheme.                       
{THORNLY}is the Thorn Lea or meadow,   
 the meadow where the thorn trees      
 stood. It is now a area of private    
 housing.                              
{CARRIAGEHILL}probably refers to a     
 right the local monks had to the      
 service of a carriage up the hill,    
 from their tenants.It is now an area  
 of private housing.                   </content>
