		<content>   There is one hospital in the area   
 called Netherlea and it is for old    
 people. Any emergencies go to D.R.I.  
 or to Ninewells in Dundee, where there
 are proper facilities. There is a     
 hospital in Kirkcaldy but it is too   
 far away.                             
   If somebody is ill they go to the   
 doctor's surgery in Newport, where    
 they receive treatment. If they don't 
 get better they go to Dundee for      
 specialised treatment.                
   Newport on Tay is very good for     
 health and has a very good record.    
   The health in our area is controlled
 by three health visitors and five     
 General Practioners. The health       
 visitors hold baby clinics at Wormit  
 twice a month on Mondays and one every
 Friday at Newport in the Blyth Hall.
