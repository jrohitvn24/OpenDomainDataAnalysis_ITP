		<title>15THORNHILL THE BUS SERVICE</title>
		<content> The local bus comes through Thornhill 
 five times a day.It starts from       
 Aberfoyle and the first bus of the day
 reaches our village at eight o'clock  
 in the morning and it goes to         
 Stirling.The second bus comes into    
 Thornhill at eleven a.m. and that also
 goes to Stirling.The first bus that   
 comes back from Stirling arrives at   
 Thornhill at six p.m.That is the last 
 bus of the day.There are two buses    
 that come from Dunblane each school   
 day and they take the High School     
 children up to McLaren High School in 
 Callander.There is also a "free bus"  
 that takes people to "Fine Fare",a    
 supermarket in Stirling.The owners of 
 this store pay for this bus to        
 encourage shoppers to use their       
 supermarket.The bus that comes every  
 day is usually late!
