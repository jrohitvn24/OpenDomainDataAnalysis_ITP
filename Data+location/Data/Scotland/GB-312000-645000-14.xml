		<title>14A TYPICAL DAY AT SCHOOL</title>
		<content> IN THE MORNING I GET UP ABOUT 7.30 AND
 HAVE BREAKFAST WHICH IS USUALLY       
 CORNFLAKES. I CATCH THE BUS ABOUT     
 8.35. WHEN WE ARRIVE AT SCHOOL WE WAIT
 ABOUT 20 MINUTES TILL THE BELL RINGS. 
 WHEN WE GET IN WE USUALLY START WITH  
 MATHS. WE USE THE SPMG TEXTBOOKS. BY  
 THE TIME WE FINISH THAT, IT IS BREAK  
 TIME. THEN WE DO LANGUAGE WORK. THIS  
 MEANS WORD STUDY, SPELLING AND        
 READING. FROM 12 UNTIL 1 O'CLOCK IS   
 DINNER TIME. IN THE AFTERNOON WE      
 CONTINUE WITH WORK IF IT ISN'T        
 FINISHED. WE THEN HAVE A FREE CHOICE. 
 FREE CHOICE MEANS USUALLY             
 ENVIRONMENTAT STUDIES PROJECTS        
 (HISTORY, GEOGRAPHY OR SCIENCE) OR    
 WORK ON COMPUTERS. MY FAVOURITE       
 PROJECT IS BASED ON THE FIGHTING      
 FANTASY IDEAS. WE HAVE SPECIALIST     
 TEACHERS WHO VISIT US AND HELP WITH   
 ART, CRAFT AND MUSIC.                 </content>
