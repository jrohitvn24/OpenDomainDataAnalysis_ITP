		<content> I get up at 8.00am and I get dressed. 
 Then I go downstairs for breakfast.   
 After that I walk down the drive and a
 school car comes for me.School starts 
 at 9.00am.In the morning we do diary, 
 spelling,arithmetic and reading.At    
 10.15 we get a play break I play games
 with my friends Margaret and Laura.   
 Lunch is from 12.00 to 1.00pm.I bring 
 a packed lunch from home usually      
 sandwiches,an apple and something to  
 drink.I like fruit juice the best.    
 School finishes at 3.30 and I either  
 get the school car home or I stay down
 in Portnahaven and play with my       
 friends.Sometimes we go crab fishing  
 but most of the time we just play     
 games like "hide and seek"or          
 "rounders".My Mum collects me and     
 drives me home.We have tea and then   
 I do my homework then watch television
 I go to bed at 8.30pm.                </content>
