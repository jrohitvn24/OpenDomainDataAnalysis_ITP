		<content> The Gardens are owned by Lord Stair   
 and are open to the public. The main  
 features are the rhododendrons and the
 monkey puzzle avenue which is about   
 100 years old.The view over the Black 
 Loch shows Inch Crindle which is a    
 small man-made island with crannog    
 remains.The Giant's Grave is a big    
 mound. The present Earl of Stair told 
 us that when the 2cnd. Earl was a     
 Field Marshall he and his soldiers    
 used the Giant's Grave for fighting.  
 There is a beautiful circular lily    
 pond covering 2 acres. There is       
 also a sunken garden and a large      
 walled garden.The gardens are         
 open daily. They usually have between 
 4000-5000 visitors annually but some  
 years have many more. There is a      
 well-stocked garden centre and a small
 shop and cafe.
