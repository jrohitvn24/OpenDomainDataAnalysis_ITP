 Back to school after yesterday's      
 holiday.Granda was attacked by the    
 cockerel.It's a  wild beast.Don't     
 think it will live very long.Was      
 picked up by Mum's friend who took us 
 to her house.Dad and Granda were away 
 to see Mum in hospital.Went down the  
 River Walk.It was a lovely day and I  
 had to take off my jersey.All the     
 flowers are coming out.I saw a grey   
 wagtail at the Fish Cree.Saw one or   
 two salmon in the river.Found a       
 pigeon's nest in the beech tree.Walked
 back to the house and Dad picked us   
 up.Went to Cubs after tea.Edzell came 
 to play football.We were beaten 5-1.  
 Got home about 8 p.m.Went to bed about
 half past.                            
                                       </content>
