		<content>{Police}Some people think that the     
 police do a good job and other 50%    
 think that they don't.The Forres      
 police have enough manpower to cope   
 with any trouble in the town.         
{Religion}There are many types of      
 religion in Forres such as            
 Protestants,Catholics and Jehovah's   
 Witnesses.There is a mixed opinion on 
 religion with some not bothered about 
 it while others ,Church goers         
 ,entusiastic.                         
{Shopping}In Forres there is an old    
 scrapyard which seems destined to     
 become the syte for a new Finefare    
 supermarket.At present there is a     
 major public debate over whether this 
 should go ahead.
