		<title>17Ladykirk church</title>
		<content> Ladykirk parish runs along the north  
 bank of the Tweed half-way between    
 Coldstream and Berwick-upon Tweed.    
    The Kirk of Our Lady of the Sheill 
 or Ladykirk as it is now called-      
 originated during a border raid.      
 Legend tells us that King James(IV) of
 Scotland was nearly drowned whilst    
 crossing the Tweed at the ford below  
 the church and he vowed he would build
 a church in memory of the Blessed     
 Virgin that could not be destroyed by 
 fire or water, and would be built of  
 stone entirely. In 1984 the stonework 
 inside and out (which includes stone  
 pews) was cleaned and guttering and   
 drainage put in order.                
    The 45 members share a minister    
 with five neighbouring parishes.      
 Consequently services are held only   
 twice a month.
