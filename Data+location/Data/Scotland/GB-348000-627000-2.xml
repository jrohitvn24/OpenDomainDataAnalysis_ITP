		<title>02WHITMUIR HALL</title>
		<content> We were allowed to go to the south    
 common and we visited whitmuir        
 house,here is some of the information 
 we found out about it.                
 The whitmuir house is very old the    
 grounds around the house are kept in  
 very good condition.  The court house 
 around the corner was built in 1907   
 and has been all renovated.  There are
 hardly any other houses near          
 Whitmuir. The farm land is used for   
 grazing and crops.  None off the      
 houses are used for residential       
 houses.                               
        All the transport around here  
 is farm machinery as there are no     
 buses that run up these back roads.   
 The road which leads up to the Hall is
 lined with Beech trees.               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
