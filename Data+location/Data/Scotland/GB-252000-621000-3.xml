		<title>03HOUSING - AUCHINLECK</title>
		<content>   The majority of houses in Auchinleck
 are owned by the council and rented to
 the tenant.                           
   The older houses were built to      
 replace the traditional miners' rows  
 in 1927 and the two later phases of   
 building (1938,1947-55) were to meet  
 the demand for housing when families  
 moved into the area as the coal mining
 operations expanded.They are mainly   
 3/4 apartments,2 storey buildings with
 full services of water and electricity
 and or gas.                           
   Owner occupier houses form a ribbon 
 development along the main roads.These
 houses are mainly detached /          
 semi-detached bungalows. The older    
 houses are built mainly of sandstone  
 which came from a local quarry.       
   There is a Sheltered Housing complex
 for the elderly adjoining the old     
 folks home ,Affleck House.            </content>
