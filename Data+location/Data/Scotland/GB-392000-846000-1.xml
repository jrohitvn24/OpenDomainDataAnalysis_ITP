		<content>   The village of Maud is in Banff     
 Buchan bounded roughly by the towns   
 Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Turriff and   
 Ellon.One half of the village lies in 
 the parish of New Deer and the other  
 in the parish of Old Deer.            
   Maud is twenty eight miles beyond   
 Aberdeen and lies in a hollow         
 valley well off the beaten track of   
 the tourist, yet at the very heart    
 of the area famed for its beef cattle 
 and broad humour, and the barley      
 which has ousted the great industry   
 of oats.                              
   The buildings are in granite and    
 there is a strong community spirit    
 which is reflected in support for     
 local organizations.Within this       
 village and others lie the origins of 
 the Bothy Ballads which commemorate   
 the hardships and simple pleasures of 
 early farming life.                   </content>
