		<title>19DUNDONALD CASTLE</title>
		<content>  The village of Dundonald is dominated
 by a 13th Century castle which stands 
 on a hill overlooking the village.But 
 long before the present castle was    
 built there was a fort _ "dun"        
 belonging to someone called Donald on 
 the same hill, hence the present name 
 of the village _ Dundonald!           
  Although the castle today is a ruin, 
 it is still water_tight because of its
 beautifully constructed vaulted stone 
 roof. The castle is looked after by   
 the Scottish Development Department   
 because of its historical interest.   
  Scotland was actually ruled for a    
 time from Dundonald Castle, for       
 Marjory (daughter of Robert the       
 Bruce) who lived there, had a son who 
 became Robert II of Scotland.         
  Although a ruin, the Castle makes an 
 imposing background to the village and
 the surrounding countryside.          </content>
