		<content>{Crime}in Port Glasgow has increased   
 steadily over the years.Most crimes   
 appear to be commited by 17_40 year   
 old males.Domestic disputes,drunkeness
 and{vandalism}are the main problems.  
   Much of the vandalism is juvenile   
 crimes which people say are the result
 of unemployment.Domestic disputes are 
 also said to be the result of lack of 
 money and{unemployment}or alcoholism. 
 Apart from these crimes there is also 
 a lot of thefts and the occasional    
 murders. Criminals have to go to the  
 Court of Law in Greenock.             
   Many people believe that there is   
 not enough police in Port Glasgow to  
 deal with the rising amount of crime  
 and that police returning to the beat 
 will reduce crime and help the fight  
 for{law and order.
