		<title>05DAIRY FARM NEAR BRECHIN</title>
		<content>{Stannochy}lies on the south bank of   
 the South  Esk one mile from Brechin. 
 The long day begins with the 4 a.m.   
 milking of the{136 Freisian}cows. This
 takes the dairymen between one and two
 hours. The rest of the day before the 
 afternoon milking is taken up         
 with tending the cattle and in washing
 the dairy. Work in the fields has also
 to be fitted in. The milk is          
 transported to the{Milk Board}by a    
 lorry each day. During the winter the 
 herd is kept inside and fed on silage 
 and cake whereas in summer they graze 
 the permanent and rotation pastures.  
 All the cattle are bred on the farm.  
 At two years old they are introduced  
 into the herd and are milked for      
 approximately 3 years.   The dairy    
 farmer has a full year with the cows  
 always needing some attention.
