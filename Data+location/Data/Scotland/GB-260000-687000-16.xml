		<content> Since the early 1970's a village fete 
 has been organised by the Parent      
 Teachers Association at the Primary   
 School. The proceeds are used to      
 purchase items of equipment for the   
 school.                               
                                       
 The fete - called the{Fintry Fling}-  
 is a major social event. Most village 
 organisations run stalls for the PTA  
 and themselves. It features sporting  
 events such as football, the highlight
 being the annual{Dunmore Hill Race.   
 This has a very respectable record of 
 16 mins 23 secs. Just look at it on   
 the map and count the contours!       
                                       
 Not quite as energetic but equally    
 popular is the annual{Fun Run}- a five
 mile circuit ending at the sports     
 club. This is tackled by old and young
 weans and dugs - all enthusiasts.     </content>
