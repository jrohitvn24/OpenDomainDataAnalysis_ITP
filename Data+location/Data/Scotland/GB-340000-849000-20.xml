		<title>20 Social Life in Keith</title>
		<content>Public Houses where alcohol is sold    
play a large part in the social life of
the community.There are 15 premises in 
Keith licensed to sell alcohol,        
including hotels,pubs and Clubs.The age
limit for drinking alcohol is 18 years 
old but there is a problem with under- 
age drinking.The opening hours of      
licensed premises are strictly         
controlled by law.Regular hours are    
from 11a.m. to 2.30p.m.and 5p.m.to     
11p.m. although these hours have been  
extended recently.Many pubs provide    
entertainment and games including      
darts, pool and dominoes.              
                                       
 The material for this Project was     
compiled and written by 2nd and 3rd    
year pupils at Keith Grammar School    
under the guidance of their Geography  
teacher,Mr.T.J.Smith during May and    
June,1985.                             </content>
