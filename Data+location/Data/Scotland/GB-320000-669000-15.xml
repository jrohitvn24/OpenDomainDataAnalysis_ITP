		<title>15MEGGETLAND PLAYING FIELDS</title>
		<content>  Meggetland playing fields are the    
 home ground for Boroughmuir Rugby     
 Football Club, and are situated off   
 Colinton Road beside the Union Canal. 
 Many rugby club matches are played    
 there and for this purpose a new pitch
 was dug out as the previous one had   
 been on a slight slope, and proved to 
 be unsatisfactory for playing Division
 1 games. In 1983 a new stand was built
 alongside the pitch for spectators.   
 Boroughmuir R.F.C's colours are blue  
 and green stripes, and this is because
 the canal is seen as a stripe of blue 
 against green.                        
  Cricket is played continuously all   
 through the summer, from April to     
 September, when the rugby season      
 starts. The Boroughmuir R.F.C.        
 clubhouse is situated here, and this  
 holds many social functions, which are
 very popular.                         </content>
