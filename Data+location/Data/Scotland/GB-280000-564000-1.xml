		<content> The focal point of our area are the   
 villages of Hardgate and Haugh of     
 Urr.  The two villages are not very   
 big having around 125 houses between  
 them.  Haugh of Urr means 'flat piece 
 of ground by the River Urr' and is    
 sometimes called 'The Haugh'.  The    
 houses are either privately or council
 owned, but most are privately owned.  
  As the villages are so small we have 
 very few amenities, but among them are
 a Post Office, a grocer, a village    
 hall, a school, a very small play park
 and an inn.  The employment locally is
 mainly farming so most people travel  
 to Castle Douglas, Dalbeattie or      
 Dumfries to find work.
