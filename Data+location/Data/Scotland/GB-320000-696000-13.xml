		<title>13WESTFIELD MINE : PHYSICAL</title>
		<content> Westfield is a rare example for the   
 U.K. of a large and deep body of coal 
 lying within comparatively easy reach 
 of the surface. Its overall           
{overburden-to-coal ratio ( 5.33 to 1 )
 is astonishingly{low for the U.K. }   
 The pit reached at its{deepest point }
 some{250 metres}and covered an{area of
{250 hectares.}At the bottom of the    
 pit, a{coal seam over 50 metres thick}
 was exposed.                          
 The main reason why the deposit was   
 not worked earlier was because a{peat}
{bog}overlay a large part of the site, 
 thus making access to the coal very   
 difficult. The peat had to be dredged 
 from the site before any excavations  
 for the coal could begin. Much of this
 peat was dumped just to the west of   
 Whinnyhall Farm - the area has been   
 landscaped but it still creates       
 marked feature on the land.           </content>
