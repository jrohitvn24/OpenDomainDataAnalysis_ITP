{"Going out at night is difficult".    
{"There should be a youth club for     
{people to have a chat with their      
{mates"."The Sports Club isn't quite   
{for us".}These direct quotes reflect  
 Fintry teenager attitude - discontent 
 with the lack of amenities. No proper 
 public transport means a dependency on
 parents for mobility, emphasizing     
 their feelings of living in a "lovely"
 geographic trap, from which it's      
 difficult to escape, even into work.  
{"I'm bored because there are no jobs  
{and no buses".                        
 Even girls who,find work in hotels and
 catering in the area, face problems.  
{"I'm off to work but I've got to stay 
{overnight as Mum can't pick me up this
{evening".}Not just a city problem     
 national peer-group pressures are seen
 here,exacerbated by lack of transport.</content>
