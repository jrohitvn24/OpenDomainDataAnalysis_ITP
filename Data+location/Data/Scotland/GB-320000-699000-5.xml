		<title>05ECOLOGY OF THE RIVER LEVEN</title>
		<content> IN THE AREA WE ARE COVERING THE RIVER 
 LEVEN IS CHANNELLED INTO WHAT IS KNOWN
 AS "THE CUT".THIS WAS BUILT IN 1832 TO
 STOP THE RIVER FLOODING.IN AND AROUND 
 THE CUT THERE IS A LARGE VARIETY OF   
 FLORA AND FAUNA.LOCAL ANGLING CLUBS   
 RECENTLY ATTEMPTED TO RE-STOCK THE    
 RIVER HIGHLIGHTS THE FACTTHAT THE     
 RIVER LEVEN ONCE WAS KNOWN FOR ITS    
 SALMON AND SEA TROUT FISHING OVER TWO 
 CENTURIES AGO.THEY ARE NOW ABSENT FROM
 THE RIVER DUE TO INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION.
 THE RIVER CONTAINS TROUT,PERCH,MINNOW,
 STICKLEBACK AND LAMPREY PLUS A FEW    
 EELS.BIRDLIFE INCLUDES DIPPER,GREY    
 WAGTAIL AND SOME KINGFISHERS.THE      
 KINGFISHERS HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN 1983 
 AND 1984 PROBABLY NESTING TO THE EAST.
 THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT POLLUTION IS     
 FROM PHOSPHATIC MANURES IN EARLY      
 SUMMER RESULTING IN A BLUE-GREEN      
 ALGAE.                                </content>
