		<title>13THE GARDEN ESTATE, ARNPRIOR</title>
		<content> The Garden estate employs one         
 gamekeeper to tend the game on 450    
 acres of woodland, 450 acres of       
 moorland, scrub and mossland, and a   
 loch of 12 acres water surface.       
 Shooting rights are owned by Mr       
 Stakis, a well known hotelier, and    
 fishing rights by Kippen Angling Club.
 The main game includes partridge,     
 pheasant, grouse, ptarmigan and       
 blackgame.  The season extends from   
 August to February, depending on      
 species. There are typically 12       
 organised shoots per year with perhaps
 7 guns and 12 beaters.  Birds are     
 brought in as 6 week old poults,      
 reared and released, 40% being shot in
 a season. Main predators include      
 foxes, crows and weasels, and poachers
 are a problem.  The loch is stocked by
 1400 rainbow trout.
