		<title>13THE CHANGING SCENE</title>
		<content> Nellie Miller,a 78 year old Glaswegian
 has lived in Stromness for 58 years.  
 She married into the Miller family who
 have lived in the same house since    
 1716.Her nephew, another Miller, will 
 inherit the house. She remembers lots 
 of shops that are no longer shops or  
 which have changed ownership and type 
 of stock.In the past many shops had a 
 mixture of everything. She remembers  
 the present British Legion as some    
 kind of stables, and a warehouse once 
 occupied the Ferry Inn car park. She  
 has noticed the changing fashions too 
 and how styles from her young days eg 
 mutton chop sleeves are now worn by   
 Stromness girls. Despite changes in   
 town and clothes, her decided view of 
 Stromness is that there "isn't a      
 bonnier place."
