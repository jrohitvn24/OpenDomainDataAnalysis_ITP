		<title>03A DAY IN MY LIFE,1985</title>
		<content> I start the day by getting up at      
{8.00am.}I get washed and dressed and  
 then I go down stairs for my          
 breakfast.I get toast,tea and a bowl  
 of cornflakes.After my breakfast I go 
 to school.I usually have five minutes 
 before the bell rings, so I play      
 football with my friends. When the    
 bell rings I go into the shelter and  
 line up.Two teachers come out to take 
 the classes in the school.I do        
 maths,project work and language during
 the day.At{3.15pm}it is hometime.When 
 I am home I get changed into my       
 playing clothes.When I am changed I go
 to a football pitch and play football 
 with my friends.At{5.30}I go home  and
 get my tea.I watch T.V.until{10.30pm  
 which is my normal bedtime.Then I go  
 upstairs to wash and then brush my    
 teeth.After that I clamber into my    
 bed.                                  </content>
