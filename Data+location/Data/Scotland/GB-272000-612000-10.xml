		<content> The Roman Catholic church of St.Conal 
 stands in the Main Street. While it   
 bears the same name as the Church of  
 Scotland it does not have the same    
 historical link withn St. Conal.      
 The parish priest, Father Joseph      
 Boland, reports that his congregation 
 has increased recently due to         
 in-coming families. There is not a    
 signficant number of Roman Catholics  
 in the parish so Fthr.Boland is able, 
 in addition to his parish work, to be 
 an R.E. adviser to Catholic Secodary  
 schools in Ayrshire. He also shares   
 this school's chaplaincy with the Rev.
 Mudaliar.                             
 Kirkconnel is also served by an active
 branch of the Salvation Army who have 
 a meeting hall on the Main Street.The 
 Plymouth Brethern have a church in the
 village and attracts a small but      
 committed membership.                 </content>
