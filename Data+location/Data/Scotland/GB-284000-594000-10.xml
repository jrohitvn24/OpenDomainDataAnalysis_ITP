		<content>    An old building in Drumlanrig St.  
 in Thornhill is the site of a         
 mysterious apparition called "The     
 Green Lady", because of her long green
 flowing dress. The building was built 
 in 1714 as the Queensberry Arms Hotel 
 using stones from an earlier building 
 called the Red House which stood on   
 the low road below Thornhill. Rumour  
 claims that the Green Lady was the    
 victim of some "dark deed" in the Red 
 House, possibly murder, and her ghost 
 then moved with the stones and timber 
 of the house when they were moved to  
 Drumlanrig Street. Most people who    
 have lived in the house, including    
 Australian soldiers billited there    
 during the war, have claimed to have  
 felt some presence. In 1947 the       
 staircase, where most sightings       
 occured, was removed but villagers    
 swear they have seen her yet.         </content>
