		<content> The work for the Domesday Project was 
 done by the Primary 7 children at     
 Strathmiglo Primary School, five girls
 and five boys. To begin with, they    
 thoroughly enjoyed what they were     
 doing.It took them out of school and  
 brought them into contact with many   
 local people who were interested in   
 what was going on and were keen to    
 contribute.Later, as the end of term  
 approached with its many distractions 
 and deadlines which had to be met,the 
 novelty began to wear off.Editing     
 screen pages became a bit of a bind.  
 Everyone was glad when the final      
 touches had been made.
