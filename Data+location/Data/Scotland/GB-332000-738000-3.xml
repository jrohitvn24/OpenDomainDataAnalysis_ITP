		<title>03The Church Part 1</title>
		<content> Our church,{St Mary, Auchterhouse,}was
 built in the 13th century. The parish 
 is almost unique in that the site of  
 the present church is the only centre 
 of religion within the parish since   
 the coming of{Christianity}to         
 Scotland in the 9th century. Prior to 
 that there were two places in the     
 parish believed to have been{Druid    
{Circles.}After the Reformation the    
 church, built in the days of{Bishop   
{Galfridus}of{Dunkeld}in the 13th      
 century, was virtually destroyed. It  
 was rebuilt in 1775 but the old{      
{Gothic}church, apart from the bell    
 tower, had disappeared and been       
 replaced by the clean classical       
 structure that we see today. The altar
 that had stood in the east end of the{
{Gothic}church was now replaced by the 
 pulpit on the south side of the       
 present one.                          </content>
