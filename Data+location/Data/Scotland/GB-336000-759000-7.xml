 First in the morning we finished our  
 Maths book,then I started Mental      
 Arithmetic.We had a short playtime    
 before the photographer arrived.He    
 took the family photos inside the     
 school, and the school group in the   
 teacher's garden.After this we had our
 lunch.It was cold meat,roast potatoes 
 and salad,then banana milk shake and  
 biscuits.                             
 In the afternoon we finished our work 
 and afterwards listened to a story on 
 the radio called 'The Enchanted       
 Whistle.'Our last subject today was   
 Art.We were doing Batik with wax and  
 dye.We are making an umbrella for the 
 play in the school concert.The play is
 'Anansi and the Sky God.'
