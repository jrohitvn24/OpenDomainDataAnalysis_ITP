		<title>06Village Shop</title>
		<content> In our village there is only one      
 shop.It is a combined general store,  
 newsagents and post office.It is very 
 convenient to shop there,otherwise we 
 have to go to Newport,where there are 
 several shops or Dundee which is a    
 city with a great variety of shops of 
 all sizes.The local shop is used by   
 most people especially Senior citizens
 ,but most families only buy small     
 quantities there.They prefer to shop  
 in Dundee at large supermarkets such  
 as Tesco or Asda where they have a    
 greater selection and lower prices.The
 shop opens early in the morning at    
 07:00 and closes at 18:00 with a break
 for lunch between 13:00 and 14:00.Many
 school children buy sweets or crisps  
 there each day when going to school.
