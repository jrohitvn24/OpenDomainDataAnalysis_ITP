		<title>14INVERURIE POLICE STATION</title>
		<content> The police station is situated in the 
 High Street. There are 17 constables, 
 3 sergeants, 1 inspector and 1 chief  
 inspector stationed there. They work  
 shifts with 5 constables and 1        
 sergeant on duty at one time.         
                                       
 The main work of the police in        
 Inverurie is dealing with road        
 traffic. Most of the time they work in
 patrol cars, but more time recently is
 being spent on the beat.              
                                       
 They have 6 police vehicles - 5 cars  
 and 1 Range Rover. They do not have   
 any police dogs, but if required they 
 can obtain a dog and handler from the 
 main police station in Aberdeen. Any  
 other services required can also be   
 obtained from the Headquarters in     
 Aberdeen. The police station is manned
 24 hours each day.                    </content>
