		<title>04Transport Around Inverbervie</title>
		<content> We no longer have a railway track in  
 our D block so we depend on {buses,   
{taxis and private cars}for transport. 
 An hourly bus service between Aberdeen
 and Montrose passes through           
 Inverbervie. Buses are provided to    
 take children to Secondary Schools in 
 either Stonehaven or Laurencekirk.    
 Children in the country are brought to
 school by one of the two {taxi firms} 
 operating in the area.                
 Only one main road runs through our   
 area - A92 which is linked to the     
 trunk road A94 by the B967. Many minor
 roads in good repair cross our block. 
 Until the 1960's there were trains    
 which ran from Inverbervie to         
 Montrose. The track which was down by 
 the sea has been lifted and houses    
 have been built just next to it.
