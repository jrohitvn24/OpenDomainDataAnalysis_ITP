		<title>16Royal Darroch Hotel 2</title>
		<content> Three joiners were driving past in a  
 small van when the Royal Darroch      
 exploded.They thought the van had been
 hit from behind but it was really the 
 force of the explosion.               
 One hundred yards across the road the 
 windows in Cults library were         
 shattered by flying debris.Cars parked
 in Royal Darroch Hotel car park were  
 extensivley damaged and the hotel mini
 bus was overturned.                   
 Steven Cambell woke to be blown out of
 bed by the force of the explosion.By  
 mid morning the fire was under control
 but people were still lining the      
 street unable to belive what had      
 happened.Ten ambulances were needed   
 and a special team of doctors were    
 brought to the scene to help the      
 injured outside the hotel.Most of the 
 injured had burns and blast wounds.
