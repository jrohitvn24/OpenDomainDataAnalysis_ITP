		<content> In prehistoric times the tribes of the
 Otalini and the Gadeni had a northern 
 frontier town called Alauna, the      
 situation of which coresponds with    
 that of Inchkeith. Several chisel-like
 tools from the prehistoric time have  
 been found on the island.             
 Nothing of interest seems to have     
 occurred on Inchkeith until the reign 
 of James IV (1488-1513). In 1497, the 
 Edingurgh Privy Council, under orders 
 from the King, instructed the         
 Magistrates to assemble all those     
 suffering from the plague and         
 transport them to Inchkeith.          
 Under his successor, James V          
 (1513-1542), the island was gifted    
 under the Great Seal to Sir Andrew    
 Wood of Largo, upon the forfeiture of 
 John, Lord Glamis. From this time     
 until after World War II the main use 
 of Inchkeith was as a military base.  </content>
