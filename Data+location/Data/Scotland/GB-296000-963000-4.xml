		<title>04AGRICULTURE AROUND REAY</title>
		<content> The area divides into three distinct  
 land use themes. To the north are the 
 arable farms of Isauld, Isauld Hill   
 and eastwards to Upper Dounreay with  
 to the south of these Achvarasdal,    
 Achiegullan, Achunabust running into  
 hill grazing southwards. Isauld House,
 built 1812, is the farmhouse of Isauld
 Farm developed from 1810 to 1840, a   
 period of great agricultural          
 improvement. Mostly ploughable land   
 growing barley and oats as grain,     
 turnips mainly now for feeding sheep  
 and grass for hay or ensilage for     
 winter feeding of cattle and for      
 summer grazing of beef cattle and     
 sheep for fat lamb production. The    
 farm workers are housed in Isauld     
 Cottages built in 1965 of modern      
 design. Except Upper Dounreay all the 
 other farms are smaller but similar in
 production and methods to Isauld.     </content>
