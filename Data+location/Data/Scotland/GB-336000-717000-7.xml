		<content> Bill McSeveny came to live on         
 Pitbladdo farm, in one of the tied    
 cottages, about 6 months ago. He is   
 principal teacher of guidance and also
 an art teacher at Bell Baxter High    
 School. He chose to live in the       
 country rather than in Cupar because  
 he has always liked to be a little    
 isolated. Also many of his hobbies    
 involve being out of doors; for       
 example he enjoys shooting, fishing,  
 walking, running, visiting the local  
 area and playing football.            
  At present Mr.McSeveny travels to    
 work by car but he will soon have to  
 find another method of transport e.g. 
 the school bus. Public transport is   
 very infrequent and in Winter access  
 is always a problem. Mr.McSeveny      
 worked on the farm while planting was 
 in progress.
