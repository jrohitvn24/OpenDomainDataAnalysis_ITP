		<title>16HOME LIFE</title>
		<content>      My house is a four apartment.It  
 contains a living room,kitchen, 3     
 bedrooms.There are 5 persons in the   
 family, my mother,my father,one       
  brother and one sister, and myself. I
 share a bedroom with my brother. On a 
 typical day  we get up at about       
 7_30am. My mum and dad go to work, my 
 younger brother  goes to secondary    
 school with me and my younger sister  
 goes to primary school.               
      We normally get home before our  
 parents who usually arrive at 5.30    
 pm.Normally we have our tea together  
 and then usually watch television .   
     At weekends the pattern is usually
 different as it is a time for some    
 leisure and recreation.The whole      
 family usually get together for       
 birthdays,Christmas and New Year. My  
{home-life}is really quite varied.
