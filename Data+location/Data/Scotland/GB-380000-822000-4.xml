		<title>04Bourtie Kirk history</title>
		<content> Bourtie Kirk is mentioned in Church   
 Records as having Hugh the Rector as  
 leader of his flock earlier than 1190 
 A.D, but there are signs of even      
 earlier activity.  Built into the     
 church all when it was rebuilt in 1806
 is a Class 1 (incised) Pictish symbol 
 stone, complete with double disc and  
 z-rod, cescent and V-rod, and miror   
 and comb.  It is protected from the   
 prevailing winds in its position high 
 on the south wall of the kirk and also
 by the yew and cedar trees which grow 
 close by.  The Kirk is also the       
 repository of a medieval knight and   
 his lady, whose efigies are built into
 th vestry wall, along with other      
 artifacts from previous ministries    
 like the 1760 bell cast in Old        
 Aberdeen, and the rail wooden         
 collection ladle made in 1671.
