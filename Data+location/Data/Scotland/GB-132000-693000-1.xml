		<content> This block is a coastal area.   It is 
 mainly sea with a few very small rocky
 islands.   The coast is very rocky &amp;  
 there are long areas of rock and      
 pebbles jutting out into the sea.     
 Some of these stones are used for road
 works etc.   In this block there are  
 several beaches both sandy and rocky. 
  Lobster fishing is carried out along 
 the coast.   There A minibus &amp; a post 
 bus regularly take passengers several 
 times a week.   Near the sea there are
 two rocky hills.   One is an ancient  
 fort and the other has an old         
 coastguard lookout post.  The rest of 
 the land is mostly flat grassland used
 for grazing sheep and cattle.  A lot  
 of this land is bog .  The dry land is
 also used as a golf course.  Part of  
 this grassland has been fenced off and
 used as an airstrip.  There is no     
 regular service but private planes    </content>
