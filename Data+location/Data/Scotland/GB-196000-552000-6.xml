		<content>  Portpatrick (Dunskey) Golf Club has  
 both an 18 and a 9 hole course.       
 Portpatrick Bowling Club has a fine   
 green and 3 tennis courts. Both clubs 
 are private but visitors are made most
 welcome.                              
  The putting green, also privately    
 owned, is popular with locals and     
 holidaymakers, especially children,   
 who enjoy nearby swings and paddling  
 pool maintained by Wigtown District   
 Council, as is Portpatrick Public Hall
 which is underutilised due to the     
 church and school halls also being    
 available. The District Council has   
 offered the use of the hall,{free of  
{charge,}to youth organisations and    
 clubs for young people. It is hoped   
 that this will lead to greater use of 
 the hall.
