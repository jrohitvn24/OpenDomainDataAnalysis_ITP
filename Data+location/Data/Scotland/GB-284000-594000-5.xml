		<content>   Education in the area is provided by
 two primary schools and one secondary 
 school. The primaries are Penpont with
 a roll of 84 pupils and Wallace Hall  
 Primary with 137 pupils. Both serve   
 their local areas. The much larger    
 secondary school, however, has a      
 greater catchment area of up to 13    
 miles and thus a larger roll of 426   
 pupils. Of the 35 pupils who left this
 school between 4th and 5th year, 11   
 went on to further education, mainly  
 at Dumfries Technical College, 19 left
 to start work and 5 left with no job. 
 In the same session (1984-85) 29      
 pupils left between 5th and 6th year. 
 Of these pupils 12 went on to further 
 education, 12 left to work, 3 left    
 with no job and 2 moved to a different
 school.
