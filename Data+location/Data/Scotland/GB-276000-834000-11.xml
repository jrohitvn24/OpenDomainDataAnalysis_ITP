		<content>  Recreation facilities are limited in 
 this small community. There is no     
 longer a Public Hall. The residents   
 have a wide and varied collection of  
 hobbies including fishing, gardening, 
 wine making, music, reading, writing, 
 photography, nature study, bird       
 watching, camping, jogging, sketching 
 and painting, walking and cycling,    
 knitting, sewing, badmington, pool,   
 snooker, darts, motor bikes and       
 swimming.                             
  The most popular hobby is gardening. 
                                       
 HIGHLAND FIELD SPORTS FAIR _ a local  
 gathering in early August _ held in a
