		<content> THERE IS A BUILDERS MERCHANT IN THE   
 VILLAGE. AT EITHER END OF THE VILLAGE 
 THERE ARE FARM BUILDINGS. TO THE NORTH
 OF THE VILLAGE IS A DAIRY FARM. THE   
 FARM TO THE SOUTH IS MAINLY ARABLE    
 WITH A FEW SHEEP. THE SCHOOL IS TO THE
 SOUTH OF THE VILLAGE. IT IS A THREE   
 TEACHER SCHOOL,MOST OF THE PUPILS COME
 FROM THE VILLAGE BUT SOME ARE BUSED IN
 FROM OUTLYING AREAS.                  
  THE OLDER COTTAGES WERE BUILT TO     
 HOUSE FARM WORKERS BUT THESE HOUSES   
 ARE NOW OWNED BY MAINLY PROFESSIONAL  
 PEOPLE WHO COMMUTE INTO EDINBURGH. THE
 COTTAGES HAVE BEEN RENOVATED TO A VERY
 HIGH STANDARD BUT IN KEEPING WITH     
 THEIR ORIGINAL DESIGN. THIS MAKES THEM
 VERY SOUGHT AFTER AND HAS PRICED MANY 
 LOCAL PEOPLE OUT OF THE MARKET.
