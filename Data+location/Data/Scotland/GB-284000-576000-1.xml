		<title>01The Glenkiln Area</title>
		<content>                                       
 This region consists of moorland and  
 rough grassland crossed by valley of  
 the Old Water. From Hills in the      
 north-west to lower, more enclosed    
 farmland to the south and east. There 
 are small patches of broad leafed     
 woodland and some conifer plantations,
 but none of these cover a very large  
 area. It is a quiet,rural             
 district,remote in parts,yet has a    
 well kept appearance, most of the     
 local people work on the land. There  
 is a dam at Glenkiln creating a       
 reservoir, which is the principal     
 water supply for Dumfries. Although   
 man made, the reservoir blends        
 naturally with its beautiful          
 surroundings. The scenery is enhanced 
 by some modern sculptures by Henry    
 Moore,sited in open air at various    
 locations,eyecatching feature of area.</content>
