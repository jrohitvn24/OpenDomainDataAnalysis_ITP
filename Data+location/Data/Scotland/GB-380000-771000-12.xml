		<content> In our area when a couple are getting 
{married}it is customary to{blacken   }
 them. Usually they will be chased by  
 friends and captured then blackened,  
 with oil, treacle or shoe polish. Then
 they are put on a vehicle and driven  
 around the streets, taken down to the 
 river and thrown in.                  
 Quite a number of people turn out to  
 see a wedding because the bride or    
 groom, or both, are usually well known
 in the area. When weddings take place 
 in this area the brides' father       
 usually throws coins onto the road.   
 This is what the children have been   
 waiting for. They make a mad scramble 
 for as many as they can collect.
