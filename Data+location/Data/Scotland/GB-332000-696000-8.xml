		<content> It is the concentration of 'miners    
 rows' which give the villagesof East  
 Wemyss and Coaltown of Wemyss their   
 character. Some of the houses are     
 privately owned, others are council   
 houses and there are also a number    
 which are owned by the Wemyss estate. 
 Unfortunately there are a number of   
 vacated and boarded up houses awaiting
 rehabilitation and other poorly       
 maintained properties which give a    
 general impression of decay and       
 neglect. However other parts are      
 attractive and well kept. In Buckhaven
 the original town centre has fallen   
 into decay however, steps are now     
 being taken to make improvements to   
 the physical structure in this area   
 rather than build houses on the       
 outskirts of the town where the       
 majority of the grond is high quality 
 agricultural land.                    </content>
