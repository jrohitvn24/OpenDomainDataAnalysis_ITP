		<title>14The Railway,Kinbrace</title>
		<content> The railway line from Helmsdale to    
 Georgemas was completed in 1874.It    
 cost Â£110,000,Â£60,000 being provided  
 by the then Duke of Sutherland and the
 rest by the Highland Railway Company. 
 So a station was built here and in    
 later years all the buildings which   
 are in our village.The stone for the  
 houses and station came from quarries 
 at Altnabreac and was taken in horse  
 drawn carts to the site where the     
 masons dressed it.All these houses are
 now either derelict or sold to other  
 people and Kinbrace is a request      
 stop.All that remains at Kinbrace is a
 waiting room.The gates have been      
 replaced by automatic lights and this 
 month a new lighting system has been  
 installed.Three trains go up the line 
 and three down daily.
