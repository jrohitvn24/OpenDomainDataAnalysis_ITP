		<title>13Cairnbulg, near Fraserburgh.</title>
		<content>  Proposals are going ahead for a BMX  
 course, skatebowl, cafe, swings, plus 
 houses for the elderly. The houses    
 will be made on an old football pitch.
 The beacon at Cairnbulg is very old.  
 The light was fitted in l9l3. There is
 a strong current beside it. It is     
 called the Trath. The beacon was built
 in the l9th century. There used to be 
 a river separating Cairnbulg and      
 Inverallochy but now it is a road     
 called Rathen Road. There is a monkey 
 pole that people used to climb to     
 watch for enemy ships or boats. One   
 night the keeper went out to the      
 beacon to light the light. When he    
 came down he was trapped because the  
 Trath had gone over the rocks. He had 
 to stay there all night until the tide
 went out.
