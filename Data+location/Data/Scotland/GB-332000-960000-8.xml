		<content>   Fishing in this area has changed.   
 There used to be 10 boats working from
 this harbour 50 years ago and 49 a    
 century ago.  Now there are just      
 two large boats based here for full   
 time fishing.  There are others - last
 year 10 - which are used for part-time
 fishing, and for pleasure.            
   Just 4 men work on the two boats    
 based here.  They fish for crab       
 between March and October using creels
 which are laid out in 'fleets' of 20  
 between Duncansby Head and Sinclairs  
 Bay. Each boat puts out about 120     
 creels.  These are mostly made of     
 wood, but more steel-framed ones are  
 being used,especially where fleets are
 near the rocky shoreline in mid-season
   The crab are then packed into       
 wooden boxes and are collected by     
 processors from the south (recently   
 Helmsdale) daily.                     </content>
