		<title>07STANDING STONES</title>
		<content>   In our area there are a number of   
 standing stones which are concentrated
 in a certain area.These stones are    
 not however standing stones as such   
 but, although they stand approximately
 2.25metres high are in fact field     
 markers.                              
   The area in which they are          
 concentrated was the old Springfield  
 estate. The stones are marked         
 "SPRINGFIELD" followed by a number.   
 The number refers to the number of the
 field on the estate plan. The stones  
 were erected c. 1850.                 
   Local talk has it that the stones   
 were erected as scratching posts for  
 cattle and the writing on the stones  
 was only secondary. Perhaps this is   
 enhanced by the size of the stones as 
 they appear to be rather elborate for 
 field markers.
