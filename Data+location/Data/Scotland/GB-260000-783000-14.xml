		<content> June. Red deer calves are born in June
 and are tagged in the ear with the    
 date and name of the estate to find   
 out where they move to. Some have     
 roamed as far as Fort William and swum
 across Loch Ericht to Rannoch. The    
 calves are weak at birth and cannot   
 follow their mothers. They are hidden 
 within seeing and hearing distance but
 they have a tendency to follow human  
 beings.                               
 July. The lower slopes of the hills   
 have to be covered with fertilizer,   
 new bridges, roads and culverts are to
 be built if their is money available. 
 Tractors, Land Rovers and ponies are  
 used for this work. At this time of   
 year roe deer can be seen in the      
 woods, never on the bare hillside.    
 There are 4 or 5 wild goats on the    
 estate and the protected pine martens 
 are abundant.                         </content>
