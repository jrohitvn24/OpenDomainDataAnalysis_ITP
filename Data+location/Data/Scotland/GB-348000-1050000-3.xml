		<content> Normal counter services are available 
 in the Sub-post office situated at    
 Backaskaill. Mail arrives from        
 Kirkwall by air on Tuesday, Thursday  
 and Saturday and by boat on Monday    
 Wednesday and Friday and is dispatched
 every day except Wednesday. The mail  
 is sorted and delivered by an         
 auxillary postman who is employed for 
 20 hours per week.                    
          The telephone service has    
 been modernised over the years and is 
 included in the STD linkage for world 
 wide communications via satellite.    
 There are 35 telephones on the island 
 and only 4 houses have no phone.      
 Outgoing calls are relayed by a VHF   
 repeater stationed on the island of   
 Sanday to exchanges all over the      
 world.
