		<title>12Transport in Moy</title>
		<content>  Most people have their own transport.
 Buses run from Inverness to Newtonmore
 with a few stops. There are three     
 buses passing each way through Moy    
 during weekdays. No Sunday service.   
  The Railway Station opened in 1896 _ 
 closed in 1966. The Railway Station   
 house is now a Guest House. The       
 Station Master's house is now a       
 private home.                         
  The A9, the old A9, the old old A9.  
 In 1977/78 the new A9 from Inverness  
 to Perth was completed. This cut a lot
 of traffic from the old A9 which runs 
 through Moy and is now mostly used by 
 local people and as an alternative    
 tourist route. A small part of the    
 original A9 remains _ this old old A9 
 runs alongside Loch Moy and is used by
 the Forestry Commission and children  
 cycling to school.
