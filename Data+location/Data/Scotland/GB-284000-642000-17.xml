		<title>17An Old Lady Remembers</title>
		<content> Mrs. Jenny Peat aged 84 has lived in  
 or near Kirkfieldbank all her life.She
 went to the village primary school    
 which she remembers as being strict   
 and where there were coal fires in    
 each classroom.The children wrote on  
 slates as there were few pencils.As a 
 child she worked at picking  fruit    
 during the summer holidays, strawberry
 and gooseberry and for which she      
 was paid about 3/_(15p)per week.The   
 row of houses in which she lived is   
 still there; it is known locally as   
 "Dublin" probably after the Irish     
 labourers who built it. Her mother    
 died in 1920 during the worldwide     
 infenza epidemic she had to give up   
 her job in a Lanark factory to look   
 after her six young brothers and      
 sisters.She thinks children of 1985   
 are better dressed, and have now more 
 freedom.                              </content>
