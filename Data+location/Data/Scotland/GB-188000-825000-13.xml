		<title>13EILEAN DONAN CASTLE,DORNIE</title>
		<content> Eilean Donan Castle is the main       
 tourist attraction in the area.It     
 welcomes visitors from all over the   
 world and its photograph  is to be    
 seen on many calendars, biscuits tins 
 and sweets boxes.Although it was      
 originally built as a defence against 
 the Vikings it was derelict for over  
 200 years and was only rebuilt by the 
 grandfather of the present owner in   
 the period 1912 to 1932.There are four
 people employed three of whom are on a
 seasonal basis and the custodian who  
 is there all the year round.The       
 custodian is also responsible for     
 maintaining the fabric.The castle is  
 open from Easter to the end of        
 September and gets between 50 and 400 
 visitors per day.They usually come in 
 cars as the nature of the castle makes
 it difficult to cope with bus tours.
