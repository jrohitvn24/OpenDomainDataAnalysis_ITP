 the hall is still full each night, but
 of people hopeful of winning star     
 prizes.                               
    The exciting Highland Games are    
 held in Dunfermline annually.         
 Stuntmen and other talented showmen   
 often perform here, in McKane Park and
 Pittencrieff Park.  Lots of other     
 thrilling games and shows take place  
 and it is very popular.               
    Disco dancing is popular with      
 teenagers and adults alike and there  
 are a few places in our block which   
 are well attended, such as "Night     
 Magic" which was called the "Kinema   
 Ballroom" for many years.  "Johnson's"
 and "Chevy's" which is part of the St.
 Margret's Hotel, are two other popular
 dancing venues for adults.
