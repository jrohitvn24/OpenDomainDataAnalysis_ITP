		<title>14POPULAR GAMES CHILDREN PLAY</title>
		<content> The most popular games played at our  
 school are football and tig.  Girls   
 like skipping.  Primary 7 girls tend  
 to chat more than play.  One of the   
 games we play in our school is Bungey.
    To play it you need a ball and a   
 wall.  The number of players can range
 from 1 to 8.  You line up and take    
 turns by throwing or kicking the ball 
 against the wall.  If you miss the    
 wall you are out.                     
 Another game is T.V. tig which is like
 tig but when the person who is 'it'   
 comes up to you, you bend down, touch 
 the ground and say aloud the title of 
 a T.V. programme.  If you get caught  
 when you are not down or if you don't 
 say a programme you are 'it'.
