 roads, hunting for mice.              
  Hen harriers,Sparrow hawk and        
 Peregrine falcon all stay alert,      
 looking out for prey.                 
  Likewise the Buzzard,who  has it's   
 nest on small crags.The birds' sharp  
 talons help it to grasp their prey as 
 they scoop it from the ground.The     
 Buzzard and Kestrel are expert at     
 hovering over fields,waiting for prey 
 to appear.                            
  All these birds are fairly rare and  
 are not often seen.

 traffic in its haste to get its prey. </content>
