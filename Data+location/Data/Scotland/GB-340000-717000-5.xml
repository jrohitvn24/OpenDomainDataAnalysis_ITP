		<title>05MY DAY AT DAIRSIE SCHOOL</title>
		<content> My name is Julie Nicol.  I go to      
 Dairsie School at 08.45.  Mrs..       
 Kircaldy, the lollipop lady, crosses  
 me over the road.  We do our Maths in 
 the morning then we have playtime.  In
 the playground there is a shed where  
 we go when it rains.  We also have a  
 football pitch and hopscotch painted  
 in the playground.  There are two     
 gates in the playground - one for us  
 and another for teachers' cars to come
 in.  After we have come in we do      
 English and at 12.30 we have our      
 lunch.  Some people have school       
 dinners, others packed lunches or go  
 home.  We go out for lunch break when 
 we finish our lunch.  Sometimes the   
 boys play football or chasing games.  
 We go in at 13.15 and do Art, Crafts  
 or Music and go home at 15.00.
