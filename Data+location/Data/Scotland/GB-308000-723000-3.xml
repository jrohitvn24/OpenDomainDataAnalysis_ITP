		<title>03HOUSING IN PERTH</title>
		<content>    Victorian housing spread along the 
 roads and railways. The villas of the 
 Glasgow Road are privately owned and  
 often used as guest houses.In         
 contrast, tenements by the railway and
 near city centre industry are some of 
 the least attractive housing in Perth.
 31% have no hot water, 59% have no    
 fixed bath and 45% no inside lavatory.
    A deprived area is a facet of every
 town and Perth is no exception. Hunter
 Crescent is such an area. Once sound, 
 these council houses have deteriorated
 due to neglect and misuse and now the 
 area has earned itself an unfavourable
 reputation as a sanctuary for drug    
 addicts and glue sniffers. Amenities  
 there are nil, living conditions are  
 poor, dogs run free, and windows      
 boarded up with wood or corrugated    
 iron are all too common. Attempts to  
 improve the area are being made.      </content>
