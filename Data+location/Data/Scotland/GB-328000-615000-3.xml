		<content>  East of 'Yiddie's Yet'(Adam's Gate), 
 where the road forded the river to    
 Ettrickside (a small farm on          
 Thirlestane estate but no longer      
 there) is the Caller Wall(well),one of
 the few remaining horse troughs in the
 valley.  a hundred yards further on is
 the Smiddy where Andrew Shankie was   
 the last resident blacksmith and lived
 at Shankend. Next is Dundas Cottage   
 with its white dog landmark and then  
 the farm of Wardlaw. Up the back road 
 is Thirlestanehope.  There is a drove 
 road known as The Captain's Road from 
 here to St. Mary's Loch, Crosscleugh, 
 Bourhope and Tibbie Shiel's Inn which 
 goes past Shepherdscleugh where Wattie
 Scott, the renowned Post, Carrier and 
 Minister's man in Ettrick was born    
 over a century ago.
