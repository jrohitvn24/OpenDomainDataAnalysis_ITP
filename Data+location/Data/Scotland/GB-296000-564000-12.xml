		<title>12NEW ABBEY - LANDSCAPE</title>
		<content>   The landscape consists of farmland, 
 forest, hill and sea.                 
   The area supports nine farms with   
 rich pasture for dairy, beef and sheep
 farming. The farmers produce their own
 grass to feed the animals and spare   
 fields belonging to other landowners  
 are often let out for grazing.        
   The nearness of the sea makes the   
 climate mild and enables gardeners to 
 grow good crops and beautiful flowers.
 On the lower slopes of the hills are  
 acres of coniferous forest, but all   
 over the area are beech, oak, ash and 
 other deciduous trees.                
   From every hill, but especially from
 Criffell (l866 ft), one can look down 
 on the village of New Abbey nestling  
 among the trees, with the Pow flowing 
 towards the sea and the ruins of      
 Sweetheart Abbey standing quietly by.
