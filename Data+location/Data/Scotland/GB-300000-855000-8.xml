		<title>08SOCIAL CONCERNS West Forres</title>
		<content> The main issues in the local          
 newspapers for one week(the second in 
 June) were the proposed Fine Fare     
 Supermarket and the new Forres        
 By-Pass.The By-Pass proposed to start 
 in 1986 is creating a lot of worry    
 because objectors may delay the       
 starting date.The Fine Fare           
 application has been refused by the   
 planners even though there is massive 
 support from the public.The proposed  
 building site is out of the town      
 centre and two years ago it was       
 decided that there should be no       
 trading on out of centre sites.The    
 editor's letter page was packed with  
 letters in favour of Fine Fare        
 although one suggests the damage it   
 could do to small traders.Others in   
 favour are saying that the small shops
 are too little for people to shop     
 comfortably.                          </content>
