		<content> Block consists mainly of agricultural 
 land with small woods or shelter      
 belts.  Farming is principally        
 pastoral but a considerable acreage of
 wheat and barley with some oil seed   
 rape and peas are grown.  Ground is   
 undulating with small watercourses    
 flowing mainly south eventually to the
 river tweed.  Cattle are reared for   
 beef and sheep for fattening on the   
 farms on which they are bred.  The    
 block is disected by the A697 trunk   
 route from west to east but there are 
 no settlements apart from farms.      
 Population is sparse and all engaged  
 in agriculture.
