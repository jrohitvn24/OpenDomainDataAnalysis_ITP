		<title>16The Sawmill-3</title>
		<content> There is another group connected with 
 the sawmill, these are the{fencers}who
 use the fenceposts made by the mill,  
 they also store their equipment there.
 They work on the estate for farmers on
 the estate and other customers who    
 benefit from their experience and     
 equipment.                            
                                       
 The foresters are kept busy all year  
 planting, brashing, weeding, felling, 
 extracting timber and draining new    
 areas.                                
                                       
 Although there is a lot of land       
 involved only a few men work at the   
 sawmill and in the forests. Because of
 new management many changes have been 
 made on the estate, but the forestry  
 side has been relatively unaffected.
