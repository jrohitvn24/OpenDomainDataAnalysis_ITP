		<content>{ The Blackness Project,1981-84,}was a 
 joint exercise by the SDA,DDC &amp; TRC   
 designed to regenerate a decaying     
 industrial area. It involved{building 
{of new factory units,conversion and   
{improvement of existing premises,     
{clearing and landscaping of derelict  
{land and provision of finance to      
{assist firms.}It has reversed the     
 decline in the fabric of the area and 
 by 1984 there had been a net increase 
 of approx. 50 firms.                  
  In the area there are approx. 160    
 establishments, employing around 300  
 people, of whom only 75 are in        
 textiles. From 1975 _ 1981 the DDC has
 spent Â£1.5 million in the acquisition 
 and demolition of derelict buildings, 
 site preparation and the provision of 
 56 small advanced factory units, of   
 which 21 are now occupied. By 1984, Â£8
 million will have been spent.         </content>
