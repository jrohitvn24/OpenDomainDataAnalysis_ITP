		<title>07THE SAWMILL AT GLASSARY</title>
		<content>   MANY PEOPLE FROM THIS AREA WORK AT  
 THE SAWMILL. TIMBER FROM THE FORESTRY 
 COMMISSION IS BROUGHT HERE TO BE MADE 
 INTO PIT PROPS AND FENCING POSTS.     
   WHEN THE TREES HAVE BEEN FELLED THEY
 ARE BROUGHT TO THE SAWMILL WHERE THE  
 BARK IS STRIPPED OFF AND THE LOGS ARE 
 THEN CUT INTO LENGTHS BY A CIRCULAR   
 SAW.                                  
   WHEN THE PROPS AND POSTS ARE MADE   
 THEY ARE STACKED IN THE YARD UNTIL    
 THEY ARE REQUIRED BY THE MINES OR     
 FARMERS.                              
   MOST OF THE SCRAP WOOD IS BOUGHT BY 
 LOCAL PEOPLE TO BE USED AS FUEL FOR   
 THEIR FIRES AND THE SAWDUST IS BOUGHT 
 BY SOME INDUSTRIES TO BE MANUFACTURED 
 INTO VARIOUS PRODUCTS.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
