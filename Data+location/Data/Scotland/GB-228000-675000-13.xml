		<content> Christianity is the main religion.    
 There are a few Mormons and Shieks    
 but no places of worship.  The main   
 branches of Christianity represented  
 are Roman Catholics and Church of     
 Scotland.  There are 2 Roman Catholic 
 Churches, St Lawrence's and St Mungo's
 and 5 Protestant Churches, 4 of them  
 Church of Scotland.  They are East    
 Congregational, Cartsdyke, Mid Kirk,  
 Wellpark East and the fifth is the    
 Elim Church.  All Christians believe  
 in God and follow the teaching of     
 Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  They do
 not all worship in exactly the same   
 way.  The Church of Scotland is one of
 the Reformed Christian Churches and   
 the established church in Scotland.   
 There are many Roman Catholics in the 
 area descendants of Irish immigrants, 
 however there is little animosity and 
 both sects get on very well.          </content>
