		<content> MOST PEOPLE PREFER INDOOR ACTIVITES   
 e.g COOKING WICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE    
 CONSIDERING THE WEATHER INN THE WEST  
 OF SCOTLAND.MALES ARE MORE ACTIVE IN  
 TERMS OF RECREATIONTHEN FEMALES       
 PARTICULARLY IN 4 ACTIVITES ON AVERAGE
 AS AGAINST FOR THE LATTER.MALES LIKE  
 WALKING AND READING THE MOST.         
 THE MOST POPULAR FACILITY IN LARKHALL 
 FOR ALL AGE GROUPS IS THE SWIMMING    
 POOL.THE MAIN REASION FOR TAKING UP AN
 ACTIVITY IS UNEMPLOYMENT AND FOR      
 KEEPING FIT.UNEMPLOMENT THE WORST     
 PRESSING PROBLEM OF TODAY REDUCES     
 PEOPLES PARTICIPATION IN THEIR        
 ACTIVITIES.EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE MORE 
 TIME MOST ACTIVITES COST MONEY WHICH  
 THE UNEMPLOYED CAN NO LONGER SPARE.AS 
 EXPECTED WE FOUND THAT INCREASING AGE 
 ALSO REDUCES PEOPLES PARTICIPATION IN 
 ACTIVITES.
