		<title>01CLANERY &amp; CULCRONCHIE AREA</title>
		<content> This area is situated North East of   
 Creetown near to Newton Stewart. This 
 area is mostly rough grazing for sheep
 and cattle consisting of moorland and 
 Heath. The land has been cultivated in
 places with this being an expensive   
 business, recultivating is slow. The  
 crop rape which has recently been     
 introduced to this area for its rich  
 vegetable oil content, has been grown 
 with turnip for feeding, helping to   
 force in the fattening process of     
 cattle and sheep for beef and mutton. 
 There is also a small Dam in the area 
 near the Clanery which is used for    
 private fishing giving pleasure to    
 many a fisherman. Brown &amp; Rainbow     
 trout are stocked up in the Dam from  
 time to time.
