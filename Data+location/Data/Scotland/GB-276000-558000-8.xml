		<title>08RECREATION - CHILDREN</title>
		<content> In our leisure time we sometimes watch
 television, especially during winter. 
 Programes we watch are  'Grange Hill',
 which is abaut children in a secondary
 school, 'Cats Eyes', about a detective
 agency run by women, and 'The Kenny   
 Everett Show', which is comedy.       
 Some of us go sailing on Carlingwark  
 Loch. We sail in Optimists, which have
 one sail, and carry one person, and   
 Mirrors, which have one large and one 
 small sail and carry two or three     
 people. We play with our friends,     
 sometimes making swings or going for  
 runs on our bicycles.                 
 During playtime at school we play     
 football,netball,rounders,cricket or  
 skipping. We also play on the swings  
 and the bars. Sometimes we play games 
 like Blue Murder where one team has to
 guess the other team's word by forcing
 the letters from them.                </content>
