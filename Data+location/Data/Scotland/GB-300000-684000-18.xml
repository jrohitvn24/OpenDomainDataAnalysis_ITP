		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE OF YVONNE</title>
		<content> My name is Yvonne Taylor. I am twelve 
 years old.I live at{Bullions Farm     
{Crombie.}I get out of bed at five to  
 seven in the morning.I take the dog   
 for a walk, have my breakfast and then
 my little brother and I walk a mile to
 Crombie Primary School. We have lunch 
 there as it is too far to walk home.  
 It takes us about twenty minutes to   
 walk to school.                       
 When I get home after school,I tidy my
 room, get changed and go out to see my
 dad who works on the farm. I do not   
 have any children of my age to play   
 with at night, as all my friends live 
 in Crombie. It can be lonely          
 sometimes. Next year I shall be going 
 to Woodmill High School and shall have
 to leave the house even earlier in the
 morning to catch the School bus.      
                                       
                                       </content>
