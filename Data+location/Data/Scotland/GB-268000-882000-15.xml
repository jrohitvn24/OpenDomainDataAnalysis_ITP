		<title>15AN EDDERTON PENSIONER'S LIFE</title>
		<content> The oldest person in Edderton is 90   
 years old. She gets up about          
 9 a.m. and gets dressed. About 1 hour 
 later she has tea and toast which     
 normally keeps her satisfied to about 
 12 o'clock. Then she has a light snack
 which takes her to about 6 p.m. and   
 she has another light snack which will
 last her to bed time when she has a   
 sandwich. During the day she does a   
 lot of reading and some house work    
 such as dusting and sweeping the      
 floor. In the evening she watches the 
 television till about 8 p.m. then     
 reads again.From 9 p.m. to about 11   
 p.m. she either watches television or 
 reads.When she checks all the         
 electricity is off she goes to bed.   
 She spends most off the time in the   
 house as she is unsteady on her feet. 
 Her grand daughter and her great      
 grandchildren visit her daily.        </content>
