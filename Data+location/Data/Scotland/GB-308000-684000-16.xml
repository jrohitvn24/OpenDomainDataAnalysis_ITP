		<title>16Pitreavie Castle (2)</title>
		<content> Pitreavie Castle Base, which is the   
 home of the Joint Maritime Hedquarters
 in the north, is used for defence and 
 rescuing.                             
 The castle itself is on Bikini estate.
  This is also where the main base is  
 The base is at least ten metres       
 underground.  One of the main rooms,  
 contains a row of teleprinters, and an
 impressive amount of electronic       
 equipment.  With this equipment, they 
 can communicate with airfields,       
 helicopters and aeroplanes to ask them
 to help with rescue and defence       
 activities. However,this base is only 
 used when the base at Northwood isn't 
 working. There is also a room which   
 displays the positions of all the     
 N.A.T.O. and Soviet ships and         
 submarines. We were lucky enough to   
 visit the Pitreavie Castle. P. Steele.
