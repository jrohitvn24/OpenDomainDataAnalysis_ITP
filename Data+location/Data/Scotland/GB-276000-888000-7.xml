		<content> The shops in Dornoch are mainly in the
 town centre, apart from a small shop  
 in Camore. There is  plenty parking   
 space close to shops. Opening hours   
 are from half past eight to half past 
 five. There is a supermarket, grocer, 
 home-bakery and butchers. In recent   
 years three other grocery shops have  
 closed but were replaced with a       
 menswear shop ice cream parlour and   
 kitchen centre. Many people prefer to 
 shop in Inverness, or Golspie where   
 goods are often cheaper. Older people,
 and those without cars, rely on the   
 shops and services in Dornoch. There  
 are shops such as Town Jail which have
 a good selection of Scottish craft and
 tourist souvenirs. Many people from   
 neighbouing villages come to Dornoch  
 for shopping and special services such
 as banking, hairdressing, soliciting  
 and building societies.               </content>
