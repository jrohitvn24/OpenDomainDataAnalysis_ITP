		<content> Peterhead  is the biggest port in     
 Britain. Boats fishing in the North   
 Sea often come in to land their       
 fish.They also use Peterhead as a     
 harbour.Out in the North Sea the boats
 catch the fish.The Purse  Seiner      
 catches herring and mackerel          
 which are pelagic fish.Meanwhile the  
 trawlers catch haddack ,cod and plaice
 which are all demersal fish.When the  
 fish are landed on deck they are put  
 into boxes,after being gutted, washed 
 then packed into boxes filled with ice
 to keep them fresh until they reach   
 port.When the fish are landed at the  
 fish market it is quickly sold to fish
 merchants who sell it to local fish   
 processing factories who can, freeze  
 it or package it,or it is sent all    
 over Britain.
