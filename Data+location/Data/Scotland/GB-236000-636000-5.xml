		<content> Two annual events in both Springside  
and Crosshouse are the summer fayre and
the gala day.Both town have a gala     
queen who is usually chosen from the   
girls attending the local primary      
school.Some of the events which take   
place during the Springside gala week  
are a treasure hunt, a pram race and   
also a fancy dress parade. The gala    
week finishes up with a gala parade and
the crowning of the Gala Queen.A new   
event which has been introduced in this
area is a summer play scheme.This      
involves various activities being      
organised which the local children can 
take part in. The activities usually   
take place over two weeks. The Brownies
and Guides from this area recently took
part in the Jamboree held in Dean Park,
Kilmarnock to celebrate 75 years of    
Guiding.
