		<content> Most of today's cyclists have  been   
 advised by police that they have to   
 wear clothing that will show up in the
 dark, and that they will have to have 
 lights on their bikes at night so they
 can be seen by drivers.Some of the    
 cyclists disobey the police and they  
 just go on the road and give no       
 indication that they are on the road, 
 and that is how accidents happen.     
 To save people getting hurt, each year
 the police come up to Croy and give us
 cycling proficiency, they also give   
 out books such as The Highway Code and
 the Owner's Handbook so that we can   
 learn more about bikes on the road,   
 and how to save other people's        
 lives.In the cycling proficiency the  
 policeman checks all the bikes and    
 sees that they are all secure for     
 taking on the roads.
