		<title>11LONGFORGAN - MARKET CROSS -</title>
		<content> In 1672 Longforgan was erected to a   
 free burgh of the barony in a charter 
 granted by Charles II to Patrick, Earl
 of Strathmore and Kinghorn. Sometime  
 later, the exact date is uncertain,   
 the Earl presented a cross to the     
 village similar to one in the grounds 
 of Glamis Castle. It is described as a
 pillar of stone with a lion on top of 
 several steps of masonry and is 21feet
 high. In approx. 1797 the cross was   
 taken from its site outside the school
 gates to a site known as Cromwell's   
 Knowe in the grounds of Castle Huntly 
 where it is currently. It has been    
 agreed by the Secretary of State that 
 the cross should be re-sited in the   
 village after requests by the         
 Community Council. Final negotiations 
 for the site of and for the re-siting 
 of the Market Cross are currently     
 taking place.                         </content>
