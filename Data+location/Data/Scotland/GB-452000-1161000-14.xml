		<title>14LAW AND ORDER ON WHALSAY</title>
		<content>  On{Whalsay}there is only one         
 policeman.In recent times there have  
 not been any robberies,murders etc.The
 only crime he has to deal with is     
 drunk drivers,probably the average age
 is 19. They go round the isle at about
 50mph on very narrow roads .          
  So far nobody has been killed,but    
 plenty of cars have been destroyed.   
  An elderly couple had just bought a  
 new Renault 5 and two drivers who were
 drunk and doing 50mph crashed into the
 couple who were doing 30mph.The two   
 drunks weren't wearing seat belts,but 
 if the couple in the Renault hadn't   
 been wearing seat belts they would    
 have been killed.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
