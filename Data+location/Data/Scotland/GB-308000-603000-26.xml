<title>26A new Academy for Moffat</title>
<content>

Our young people moved out of the old Academy building last year into a brand new public/private initiative Academy that has been built on land at Hammerlands.  It is still an all-through school, taking children from age 3 to 18.  They have been provided with the most amazing facilities, whether their interests are in practical subjects, IT or music.  The children are particularly fortunate to have been supplied with such wonderful music-making facilities.  To the best of my knowledge, the Academy has always had a very good reputation and this continues.   &lt;br />
