 There is an amazing number of arts and
 crafts practised in this area.        
 A local {Arts and Crafts Society }has 
 recently been formed.This is not only 
 to display work once a year,but to    
 give the participants an opportunity  
 to meet together. Four {potters }make 
 a variety of ornaments and useful     
 articles. Professional and amateur    
 painters  paint in a variety of styles
 and media. Knitting by hand and       
 machine is undoubtedly the most       
 popular craft.Some knitters collect   
 wool from hedgerows,spin,then knit it.
{China painting},collage,embroidery and
 soft toy making are enjoyed mainly by 
 women while more men make children's  
 toys,do wood turning and carving.{    
{Theatre groups}come to the schools and
 there is a thriving Amateur Operatic  
 Society.                              </content>
