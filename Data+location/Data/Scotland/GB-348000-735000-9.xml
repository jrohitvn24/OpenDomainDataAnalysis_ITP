		<content> Most of the land in our area was at   
 one time owned by the Earl of Panmure,
 and, although many farmers have taken 
 the opportunity to buy the land they  
 farm, some farms are still tenanted,  
 and some areas still managed by the   
 Estate (now belonging to The Norwich  
 Union Insurance Group). Most of the   
 land managed by the Estate is         
 woodland, grown for timber and also,in
 the Parks and Policies, for pheasant  
 shooting. In our unit approx. 1 square
 km is under woodland grown for timber,
 consisting mainly of larch and spruce,
 with some Scots Pine. In the autumn   
 gales of 1983, some 4 acres were blown
 down, and in each subsequent period of
 strong wind, more and more trees have 
 succumbed. A decision was made to     
 clear fell the area, and while most   
 will be replanted, some of the better 
 ground may be reclaimed for farming.  </content>
