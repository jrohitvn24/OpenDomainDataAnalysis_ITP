		<content>{Milnathort}is at the crossing of the  
{A90}Edinburgh to Perth and the{A91    
 Stirling to St Andrews roads, and is  
 joined by the{A911}to Glenrothes, Fife
 The{M90 Motorway}now by-passes the    
 village, taking nearly all the north- 
 south traffic.                        
 Bus services pass through the village 
 linking Lochgelly and Glenrothes with 
 Kinross, Inverness with Edinburgh and 
 St Andrews with Glasgow.  The Scottish
 Bus Group companies and private long- 
 haul operators ply these routes.      
 Car-sharing is done by some people    
 whose work is not in Milnathort. Perth
 is 16 miles away, Rosyth Dockyard is  
 20 miles, and Edinburgh 28 miles.     
 Most children in this area walk to    
 school (Milnathort Primary School is  
 in block 03080702), but some come by  
 car because there are very few foot-  
 paths beside the country roads.       </content>
