{CROPS}- We grow spring barley,winter  
 barley and wheat. The barley goes to  
 the grain dryer and goes into the     
 bins. Then a lorry comes to collect   
 it, the barley comes out of bins into 
 the lorry. We had an old house and    
 some men came to build a new one.     
 While it was being built, my mum, dad 
 and Kevin stayed at{Pyeston Farm.}We  
 have bulls, cows, bullocks and        
 heifers. We grow spring green cabbage,
 savoy cabbage, sprouts, turnips and   
 cauliflower. My dad's name is William 
 Black and he is 41 years old. My mum's
 name is Margaret Cairns Black and she 
 is 39. My brother's name is Kevin and
