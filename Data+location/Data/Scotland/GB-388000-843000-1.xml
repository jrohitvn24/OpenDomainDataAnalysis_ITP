		<content>{ }This area, to the south of New Deer 
 village, is entirely made up of       
{agricultural land, most of which is   
{intensively managed.                  
   There are pockets of uncultivated   
 land in the area, mostly{small areas  
{of wetland or peatbog,}and also some  
{small plantations of sitka spruce.    
   In recent years almost all the      
{unoccupied farmhouses in the area have
{been renovated}and often occupied by  
{non-farming residents.}The{farms}in   
 the area{have become larger by        
{amalgamation}and the number of people 
 working directly on the land has      
 decreased due to{mechanisation.       
   As a result of the above changes the
 local population has not reduced but  
 has changed in character.
