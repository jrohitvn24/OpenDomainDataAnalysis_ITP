		<title>13BON-ACCORD BATHS 2</title>
		<content> From 8pm until 10pm each evening their
 are special classes for life-saving   
 Aberdeen swimming team,Diving         
 club,Scuba diving club and            
 synchronised swimming.                
 Upstairs there are 4 sunrooms,turkish 
 baths,sauna and gym.Here one can      
 weight train with the Spartan Club or 
 even join a judo club.                
 The baths are popular with Aberdonians
 and tourists alike but certain        
 improvements could be made:some       
 showers need to be renovated and the  
 water temperature should be kept more 
 constant.Changing areas should be kept
 clean at all times and the staff      
 should be nice and pleasant.          
 On the whole however our class agrees 
 that these bath are by far the best   
 swimming facilities in Aberdeen.
