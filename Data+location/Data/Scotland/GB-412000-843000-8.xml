		<content> My name is Victoria Keith.I live with 
 my mum, dad and my brother Jason in a 
 big granite house on the South Road on
 the  outskirts of Peterhead.The house 
 was built around the year 1885.The    
 house has 10 old fashioned rooms.It   
 has a big garden that is fun to play  
 in.On one side of the house is a      
 tarmacadam play area.On the side there
 is a field leading to the beach and   
 behind the house across a field is    
 Meethill Tower.The prison is along the
 road from our house which once        
 belonged to Prison Authorities.Our    
 neighbours are called the             
 Leslies.Yvonne is my friend.There is  
 not a lot of children in my area      
 because most of the houses have older 
 people in them,but I still love where 
 I live.
