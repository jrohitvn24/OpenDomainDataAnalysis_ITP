		<content> The Buchan Observer was founded in    
 1863 by John McArthur &amp; Sir Hugh Reid 
 (editor)It now has been going strong  
 for 122 years.At first it came out    
 twice weekly Tuesday &amp; Friday.Then    
 they changed it to Tuesday only.They  
 now make roughly just under 9000      
 copies a week &amp; all of them are sold. 
 If you look at a copy of "Buchan      
 Observer" you will see the words      
 "Veritas Vincit"which is Latin for    
 "Truth Succeeds".                     
 The office &amp; printing                 
 works where the paper is made is      
 situated in 17 Chapel Street. The     
 "Buchan Observer" has always been a   
 local newspaper &amp; the purpose of it is
 to advertise &amp; tell us the local news.
