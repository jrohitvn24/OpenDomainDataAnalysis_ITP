		<title>02THE EFFECT OF DOUNREAY</title>
		<content> Due to the coming of the Prototype    
 Fast Breeder Reactor at Dounreay, Reay
 has had considerable improvements made
 to it and its surroundings. The roads 
 into Reay have been improved          
 considerably because of increased     
 volumes of traffic to and from the    
 plant which lies on the main Thurso to
 Reay road. The United Kingdom Atomic  
 Energy Authority (UKAEA) has made     
 provision for snowploughs to keep the 
 road to Dounreay clear during the     
 winter, to allow workers to reach the 
 plant,  but this also means that it is
 relatively easy for the inhabitants of
 Reay and its surroundings to travel to
 Thurso when all the other roads in the
 county may be impassable.
