 The aim of the Woman's Guild is to    
 unite the women of the Church in the  
 dedication of their lives to the Lord 
 Jesus Christ through Worship,         
 Fellowship and Service.               
 The local branch meets monthly in     
 Cranshaws School from October to      
 April. Worship takes place in opening 
 devotions and in an epilogue conducted
 by members. Speakers throughout the   
 session cover affairs of the Church's 
 work; Board of World Mission and      
 Unity; Department of Ministry and     
 Mission; and the Board of Social      
 Responsibility. Tea, home baking and a
 friendly chat form an integral part of
 the evening. One delegate for each    
 board attends meetings in Duns and in 
 Edinburgh to keep the Branch informed 
 of the work and needs of the church.  </content>
