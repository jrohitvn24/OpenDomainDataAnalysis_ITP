		<content> people from all around.It is the      
{EDINBURGH CRYSTAL REGATTA}which you   
 might think was only of interest to   
 yachtsmen However although it has     
 grown into the biggest regatta on the 
 Clyde there is also lots of fun for   
 non-sailors with dancing displays,It's
 a Knockout,tug-of-war,lifeboat rescues
 painting competitions and mini floats.
 This event is reminiscent of regattas 
 held here before the war with fun for 
 everyone.                             
 Our area does not really have any very
 ancient customs it seems that         
 something is popular for a time dies  
 out and is replaced later by a similar
 event.                                
 One exception to this is the          
 Remembrance Service on fifth November 
 which is attended by many people      
 although because of population changes
 few knew those named on the memorial. </content>
