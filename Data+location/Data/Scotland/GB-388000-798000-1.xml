		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content>  Our grid reference of area for this  
 survey covers part of{Banchory-       
{Devenick Parish}and part of{Maryculter
{Parish.}The pupils who have done this 
 survey and who present these pages    
 attend Banchory-Devenick School and so
 we have used our name as the title    
 although the school is outwith the    
 grid.                                 
  This is a rural area situated        
 south and west of{Aberdeen}on the     
 southern banks of the{River Dee.}It   
 stands between 4 &amp; 5 hundred feet     
 above sea level, the coast being three
 miles to the east.                    
  Because of the area's proximity to   
 Aberdeen and the{Oil Related          
{Industries}the families who live here 
 are affluent and have many opportunit-
 ies. They can enjoy the advantages of 
 the city and they have a very strong, 
 settled community bond.               </content>
