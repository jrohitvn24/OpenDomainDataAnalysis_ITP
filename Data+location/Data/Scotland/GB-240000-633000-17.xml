		<content> The average family consists of a      
 mother, father and two or three       
 children.   Most fathers work but many
 cannot find suitable work due to the  
 high rate of unemployment in the area.
 Some mothers also work but others stay
 at home to look after small children. 
 Children aged between five and sixteen
 must go to day school.                
 In the evening and at weekends the    
 family take part in the many          
 recreational activities suppled by the
 town.                                 
 Most families have a pet. The most    
 popular pet is a dog but other        
 families prefer to keep smaller       
 animals.
