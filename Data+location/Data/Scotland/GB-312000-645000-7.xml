		<content> ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE A MONTH, MANY     
 PEOPLE IN OUR AREA GO SHOPPING TO A   
 BIG SUPERSTORE IN EDINBURGH CALLED    
 ASDA. OTHERS GO TO PENICUIK OR PEEBLES
 WHICH ARE NEARER, OR EVEN TO OUR LOCAL
 VILLAGE OF WEST LINTON.               
 THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE CARS DEPEND ON  
 THE VANS COMING ROUND TO DELIVER      
 THINGS TO THEM. WE HAVE LOTS OF VANS  
 VISITING OUR FARM. THE GROCER COMES   
 TWICE A WEEK AND SELLS MOST THINGS.   
 THERE IS A FISHMONGER WHO ALSO SELLS  
 FRUIT, AN ICE-CREAM MAN WHO ALSO SELLS
 SWEETS, AND A FISH AND CHIP MAN COMES 
 EVERY WEEK. EVERY MORNING A MILKMAN   
 CALLS AND DELIVERS MILK FROM THE LOCAL
 DAIRY. NEWSPAPERS ARE DELIVERED FROM  
 THE NEWSAGENT IN WEST LINTON.         
 OUR FREEZERS ARE WELL-STOCKED. MOST OF
 US HAVE GARDENS AND PLENTY OF FRESH   
 VEGETABLES AND FRUIT IN SEASON, AND WE
 FREEZE THE SURPLUS.                   </content>
