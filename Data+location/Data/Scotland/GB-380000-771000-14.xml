		<content> In the morning I usually get up at    
 about 8.00am. I get dressed and then  
 have my breakfast.                    
 After that I pack my school-bag and   
 get ready for school arriving there at
 8.45am and play football until school 
 starts.                               
 We work until 10.30am then it is our  
 play-time. The games we play are      
 football or sometimes "kick-the-can". 
 We go back to work at 10.45am and the 
 next break is not until 12.15am. It is
 time for dinner and I have a          
 packed-lunch. At 1.15pm it is back to 
 work until home time at 3.15pm.       
 I go home, do my homework and watch   
 T.V. until it is time for tea.        
 Later I go out to play football or    
 "kerby" with Neil.                    
 I go home at about 8.30pm and have    
 something to eat. I watch T.V. until I
 go to bed at about 10.00pm.           </content>
