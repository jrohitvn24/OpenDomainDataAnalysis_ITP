		<title>18TERRAIN,ULLAPOOL.</title>
		<content> The landscape of this area is the     
 result of erosion, including that of  
 glaciers, on the rock types present.  
 There is a major thrust fault crossing
 the area, called the Moine Thrust,    
 formed during mountain building.      
 The rocks at Ullapool are Lewisian    
 gneiss,Torridonian sandstone,Cambrian 
 quartzite,grit,limestone and Moine    
 schist.The sequence starts with gneiss
 which was heavily eroded before the   
 sandstone was deposited.The rest of   
 the Cambrian sediment was then        
 deposited in a shallow sea before the 
 Moine Thrust moved schists over the   
 sequence. The hills to the north of   
 Ullapool have been glaciated then the 
 Ullapool River cut through the hills  
 and formed a gorge.Lochbroom is a     
 fiord cut by a major valley glacier.  
 Higher sea levels cut 2 raised beaches
 at both Newton Loggie and Ullapool.   </content>
