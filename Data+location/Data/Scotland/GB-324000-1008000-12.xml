		<title>12A DAY IN THE LIFE OF YVONNE</title>
		<content> I usually get up at 8.30,make my bed  
 and then have my breakfast of tea and 
 toast.Michelle comes for me and we go 
 for Marina on the way to school. We   
 stop by Bremners for a playpiece.At   
 school we sit at the pegs and discuss 
 the latest gossip or go out and play  
 netball.Class begins at 9.30 and in   
 the morning we usually do Maths,Mental
 English, Reading etc.At our 11 o'clock
 break we eat our crisps, talk and     
 wander about the playground . I may go
 home for lunch at 1p.m. or stay and   
 have school dinners. The afternoon    
 activities are more fun eg drawing,   
 discussing,researching etc. After     
 school there may be netball.On my way 
 home I stop by mum in the paper shop. 
 After my tea and homework I go out    
 with my friends along the street,go to
 someone's house to listen to records  
 or go to the new playpark till 8.30.  </content>
