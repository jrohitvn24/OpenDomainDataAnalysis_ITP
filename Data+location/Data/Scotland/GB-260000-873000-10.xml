		<content> (3) Loch Dubh                         
                                       
 Loch Dubh is gaelic for 'black loch'. 
 There are four islands on the loch    
 with seagulls nesting. There are trees
 and bushes on the islands and fish    
 live in the loch.                     
 The loch is wooded on three sides and 
 grassed on the remaining side. The    
 Forestry Commission own the land      
 around the loch and there is a log    
 cabin in the woods.                   
 Up until a couple of years ago the    
 people of Ardross used the loch for   
 swimming and fishing but this has     
 stopped as people from out of the area
 were misusing the amenity and         
 polluting the loch.                   
 The loch is about 400 metres wide and 
 800 metres in length: it is about 15  
 metres deep. It is in a beautiful     
 setting north-west of the Mains.      </content>
