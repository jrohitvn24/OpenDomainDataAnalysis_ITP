		<title>10Hillside Church</title>
		<content> Hillside Kirk is a roofless stone     
 building. It was used until 1963 when 
 it's few remaining members united with
 the Church of Scotland. As well as    
 being an imposing building, it has an 
 interesting history. In 1843,many     
 ministers expressed discontent at the 
 General Assembly over the way that    
 ministers were being appointed by the 
 local laord through patronage. As a   
 result Rev. Ingram, then minister at  
 St. John's Church at Baliasta, broke  
 away,along with 1054 of the total 1160
 established church  members. The Free 
 Church was built at Hillside on land  
 owned by the Ingrams. It's building   
 took a mere 6 months and was mostly   
 free labour . Meanwhile, the new      
 congregation met under canvas.During  
 the first sevice at the Kirk, the     
 tarpaulin blew away.
