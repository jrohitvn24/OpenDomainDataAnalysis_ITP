		<title>01Carnoustie to Easthaven.</title>
		<content>   On the road to Easthaven there are  
 houses that are old and new and all   
 shapes and sizes.Most of the road is  
 accompanied by the railway.On the way 
 you pass by a playpark - a meeting    
 place for punks.Some of the roads are 
 very bumpy. When you ride over it on  
 your bike it makes you wonder how     
 these bumps get there.How long have   
 they been there?Why aren't they fixed?
 As you approach Easthaven the road    
 becomes quite twisty and is dangerous.
   The alternative route to Easthaven  
 is by the beach.Still water rushes now
 and again.An enormous wave dashes in  
 like a person dancing.Walking along   
 the beach,your feet sink in the soft  
 sand and the wind blows on the sand   
 and makes a rustling sound.Passing the
 seven little fishing sheds of West-   
 haven you soon come to the countryside
 and then you are in tiny Easthaven.   </content>
