		<title>05 LOCAL SHOPPING FACILITIES</title>
		<content>   As most of our area is farmland and 
 hillside,there are not very many shops
 The Main St. of Kilsyth is used by the
 people of our block for their         
 every-day "messages",but this is not  
 in our area.                          
 The shops are quite good for every day
 needs, but most people travel to other
 towns,such as Edinbrugh,Glasgow,      
 Stirling,Falkirk &amp; Cumbernauld, to    
 find Super markets and Department     
 Stores                                
   In our area we have small local     
 shops which are frequently owned by   
 Indians and Pakistani families.There  
  are about 10/15 small shops in our   
 area of Kilsyth which sell a wide     
 range of goods for everyday use.      
   Mobile shops tour the housing areas 
 from time to time selling groceries   
 and other essential goods.
