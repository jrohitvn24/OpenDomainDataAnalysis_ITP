 WOULD LIKE TO SEE SCHOOL OPENING TIMES
 ALTERED TO BRING SCOTLAND INTO LINE   
 WITH THE AMERICAN PATTERN _ ie. 7am TO
 1 pm.SUCH WAS THEIR DETERMINATION THAT
 THEY WROTE TO THEIR MEMBER OF         
 PARLIAMENT TO ASK HIS HELP.           
   HE ASKED THEM TO HOLD A REFERENDUM  
 ON THE SUBJECT BY ASKING THEIR MUMS,  
 DADS,BROTHERS,SISTERS AND TEACHERS.IF 
 THEY WERE ALL IN AGREEMENT THEN HE    
 PROMISED TO TAKE THE MATTER UP WITH   
 THOSE OFFICIALS WHO MAKE THE SCHOOL   
 TIMETABLES.                           
   THIS ITEM WAS BROADCAST ON          
 TELEVISION AND COVERED IN THE         
 "COURIER".HOWEVER THE MUMS GAVE IT THE
 "THUMBS DOWN" AND OUR OPENING TIMES   
 WILL REMAIN THE SAME 9am TO 3:30pm.
