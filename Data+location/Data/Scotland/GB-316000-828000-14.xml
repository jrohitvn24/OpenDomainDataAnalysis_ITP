		<title>14GLENLIVET SHOPPING</title>
		<content>   Up  until  a  year  ago  there was a
 village  shop in Bridgend of Glenlivet
 but it was closed down as  it  was  no
 longer  a  profitable  business.  Most
 people now do their weekly shopping in
 the nearest town, travelling by car or
 by the bus  service which runs twice a
 week. There are  still weekly delivery
 vans which bring bread,  fish, meat or
 groceries. These vans are  mostly used
 by the elderly and those without their
 own transport.                        
   Still at Bridgend there  is  a  post
 office  which  is  used  for   drawing
 pensions and family allowances as well
 as for buying stamps.                 
   Two or  three  times  a  year  large
 drapery vans visit the area which sell
 household  utensils  and  furniture as
 well as cloths, sheet, etc.           
   The mobile  library  visits  once  a
 fortnight with books to suit all.     </content>
