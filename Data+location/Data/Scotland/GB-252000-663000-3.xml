		<content> The major land use in the area is     
 residential.  The{housing}stock is    
 varied. The older{housing}is mainly   
 found towards the River Clyde and the 
 City Centre.  The sandstone{tenement,}
 built in the nineteenth century, is   
 typical.  The newer housing occupies  
 most of the southern half of the area,
 and was built between the wars, two   
 stories, (semi-detached, cottage style
 or terraces), being typical. The most 
 recent postwar housing includes high- 
 rise flats.                           
    There is much{local authority}     
{housing}but also some large areas of  
 private{housing.} Most of the recently
 built{housing}is on the gap sites left
 by the demolition of Victorian        
{tenements,}with one former shipyard   
 also used in this way.  The remaining 
{tenements}are being modernised by     
 Housing Associations.                 </content>
