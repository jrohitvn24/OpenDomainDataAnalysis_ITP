		<title>18A DAY IN THE LIFE OF APRIL</title>
		<content>{April Macleod, age 11.                
 My Mum usually wakens me about 8.15   
 and I get up shortly after that.After 
 breakfast I get washed and dressed. A 
 few minutes walk gets me to school for
 9.30,after which we do some work until
 the first break at 10.45. After that  
 we do more work until lunchtime at    
 12.30. Unlike all the other children I
 go home for lunch. In the afternoon we
 usually do project work until 3.30    
 when school finishes. I then walk home
 and change my clothes then usually I  
 go down to the shop. After that I     
 usually watch T.V.till 5 o'clock when 
 we have dinner. I do the dishes next, 
 then take the dog for a walk down the 
 croft. Sometimes I go out to play in  
 the evenings or play cards with Mum   
 and Dad. Then I watch T.V. after which
 I get ready for bed. Once in bed I    
 read before I go off to sleep.        </content>
