		<title>11CROSSFORD SCHOOL (continued)</title>
		<content> When the pupils move on to secondary  
 education they go to Queen Anne High  
 School in Dunfermline, unless they are
 Roman Catholic, as then they will move
 on to St. Columba's High School, also 
 in Dunfermline.                       
    Crossford School has an unusual    
 design, the junior rooms, partly open 
 plan, leading off from a central      
 circular hall where meetings and      
 indoor P.E. can take place. This hall 
 is linked by a corridor, off which lie
 the administration rooms, to a smaller
 semi-circular area which gives access 
 to the infant rooms. The building is  
 surrounded by playgrounds, with a     
 large playing field, but some of this 
 land has had to be used for a portable
 classroom to house one class.         
    In the evenings the building is    
 used for adult education classes,     
 P.T.A. meetings etc.                  </content>
