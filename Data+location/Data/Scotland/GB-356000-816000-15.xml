		<content> The River Don and its haughlands      
 dominate the area which is of low     
 relief (450-625 ft). The granite and  
 schists bedrock is covered by river   
 alluvium and glacial till. The sandy  
 loams and peaty gley soils are mostly 
 cultivated. Fields are divided by low 
 stone walls or fences, hedges are     
 absent but the bare nature of the     
 landscape is relieved by shelter      
 belts, small conifer plantations and  
 amenity groups of broadleaf trees.    
   The traditional building stone was  
 granite  but  most recent buildings   
 are harled concrete brick. A feature  
 of modern farm steadings are large    
 concrete and metal Dutch barns and    
 metal silos. Listed buildings include 
 Haughton House, its ice house, cottage
 and lodge, a 19th century toll house  
 and Alford episcopal church.
