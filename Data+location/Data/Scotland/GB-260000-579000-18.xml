		<title>18DALRY (KIRK)CHURCH CUSTOMS</title>
		<content>    After weddings in Dalry church ,the
 womenfolk line the church avenue to   
 see the bride.                        
    At funerals men in dark suits and  
 black ties walk in procession behind  
 the hearse. In the kirkyard they line 
 the route to the grave. Eight close   
 associates of the deceased each take a
 cord and so symbolically help to lower
 the coffin into the ground.           
    Communion Services are held twice  
 a year.On the Sunday before Communion 
 young people and others who have      
 received instruction from the         
 minister, become church members       
 officially.The right hand of          
 fellowship is extended to them first  
 by the minister and then by each of   
 the elders in turn.
