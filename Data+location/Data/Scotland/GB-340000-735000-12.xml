		<content> The farmer's wife we interviewed is   
 involved in{VOLUNTARY SERVICES}and the
{WOMEN'S RURAL INSTITUTE.}             
 The WRI meets once a month mainly for 
 entertainment but cookery and         
 embroidery classes are also run.      
 However, fewer people attend now      
 because of TV. In the 1940's there    
 were 144 members - today only 70.     
 Altogether there are 53 WRI's in      
 Angus.                                
 The Institute holds an annual 'show'  
 in March and they also have a stand at
 the Royal Highland Show.              
 Her voluntary service is{MEALS ON     
{WHEELS.}She does this twice a week    
 once a month. The meals are collected 
 from a local hospital and distributed 
 to elderly people in Inveraldie and   
 Tealing.
