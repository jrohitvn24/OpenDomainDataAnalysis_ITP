   The Rosehill Centre is a training   
 centre for mentally handicapped       
 adults.The people who go there learn  
 all sorts of different activities such
 as cooking,art,joinery and            
 housework.They sometimes have an open 
 day when they make things to sell.The 
 handicapped people sometimes put plays
 on too.                               
   The Rosehill Centre is run by the   
 Social Work Department. Some of the   
 handicaps are the result of Downs     
 Syndrome, vaccine damage, brain damage
 at birth and accidents. The social    
 workers are taught how to cope with   
 these people. I think the Rosehill    
 Centre is a good place because it     
 teaches the handicapped how to cope   
 with life.
