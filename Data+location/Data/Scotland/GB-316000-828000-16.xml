		<title>16CASTLES IN GLENLIVET</title>
		<content>   The{Castle of Blairfindy }was  built
 by  John Gordon, Laird of Cluny around
 1565.  The reason for the existance of
 this Castle  is not known. It has been
 suggested  that it was a  hunting-seat
 of the Earls of Huntly  and  also that
 it  may have  been intended to control
 the  pass  through  Glenlivet  to  the
 south.  The  castle  has   long   been
 roofless  but  the  walls  are   still
 standing.                             
  {Drumin  Castle  }was  built  in  the
 fourteenth  century.  The  founder  is
 understood  to  have  been   Alexander
 Stewart,  Earl of Buchan, better known
 as The  Wolf  of  Badenoch. The castle
 commanded the entrance  to the valleys
 of the Avon and  the Livet. In 1490 it
 passed  into  the hands of the Gordons
 with whom it remained until the 1930's
 when  it  became  part  of  the  Crown
 Estates. Only some walls remain.      </content>
