		<content> The situation in a valley, with many  
 small rivers, is an asset in          
 attracting a variety of wildlife.     
 There are numerous common birds, like 
 starlings, sparrows,thrushes, finches,
 and tits as well as dippers, herons   
 and grebes and various types of duck. 
 Birds are becoming fewer in number,   
 and some, like the kingfisher,lapwing 
 and corncrake, becoming rarer with the
 increasing use of weedkiller and      
 pesticides and the removal of         
 hedgerows.                            
 The marshy areas, like the "Duckie"   
 near the station, are habitats for    
 frogs, toads and newts as well as     
 sedge warblers and reed buntings. They
 also harbour a variety of plant life, 
 including mint, fennel, forget-me-nots
 and pink campion.                     
 There are only about three badgers    
 left, and a few minks and otters.     </content>
