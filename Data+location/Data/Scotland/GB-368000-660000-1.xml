		<title>01Cranshaws, Whiteadder Valley</title>
		<content> The block lies in the Lammermuir Hills
 and is a hill farming area. It is the 
 Upper Valley of the River Whiteadder  
 (pronounced Whitadder). The land is   
 mainly rough grazing and woodland -   
 the arable land lying close to the    
 river. Population is 64 - 40 adults,  
 24 children (9 high school, 9 primary,
 6 pre-school). 18 adults are in paid  
 employment (4 are full-time, 4 part   
 time agricultural workers). The river 
 is restocked with trout each spring.  
 Fishing is allowed only on purchase of
 a permit. The nearest shops are in    
 Duns - 10 miles to the South. A mobile
 butcher's van visits twice per week.  
 It delivers ordered bread and milk. A 
 milkman delivers milk, cream and eggs 
 three times weekly. The mail van comes
 each day except Sunday and delivers   
 newspapers. A mobile library visits   
 once each fortnight.                  </content>
