		<title>07MONEY MATTERS IN STEWARTON</title>
		<content> Three of the main Scottish banks have 
 had branches in Stewarton for many    
 years-The Bank of Scotland,The        
 Clydesdale Bank and The Royal Bank.In 
 recent years offices of building      
 societies have opened -Halifax,Leeds, 
 and Yorkshire.The Post Office provides
 a useful service in Savings.Many      
 inhabitants use these facilities but  
 some still bank in the place where    
 they work or where they lived before  
 moving to Stewarton.Access,Barclay and
 Visa cards are also well used. More   
 and more people are now being paid by 
 cheque or direct to their bank        
 accounts. So fewer purchases are made 
 by cash.
