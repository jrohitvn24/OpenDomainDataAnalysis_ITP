		<content>  In Strathnairn we have lots of birds 
 of prey,we have the{golden eagle,     
{buzzard,sparrowhawk,osprey,peregrine  
{falcon,kestrel,barn owl,long eared owl
{and short eared owl}nesting around the
 area.                                 
{Golden eagle                          
 The golden eagle eats mammals to the  
 size of a fawn.They live about 50 feet
 of the ground but have been seen      
 nesting in bushes.Some think a sheep  
 might jump down on a grassy ledge then
 an eagle comes along and screams.This 
 makes the sheep jump off the edge then
 the eagle can eat.                    
{Osprey                                
 The osprey nests near water in pine   
 forests and feeds on fish up to 14    
 pounds or more.The female lays 2_4    
 white eggs heavily marked with brown. 
 They have big and powerful tallons to 
 catch the big fish to feed the chicks.</content>
