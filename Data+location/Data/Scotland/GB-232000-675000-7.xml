		<content>    Cardross has a population of       
 approximately 2000 people. They either
 live in the village or the surrounding
 countryside. Cardross Primary School  
 at present has a role of over 200     
 children but there are 700 children of
 school age or under. Until 20 years   
 ago there was little movement in the  
 population but in more recent years a 
 large number of new houses have been  
 built, bringing many young families   
 into the area. Cardross has a floating
 population. People move into the area 
 then go away after staying a few      
 years, often because the father       
 changes his employment. There are     
 still some people in Cardross who have
 lived there all their lives, a few of 
 them being well over 80 years of age.
