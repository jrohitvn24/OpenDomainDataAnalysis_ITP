		<title>04THE EDEN ESTUARY</title>
		<content> A nature reserve was established in   
 June 1984 at the mouth of the River   
 Eden to protect its ecology. At high  
 tide Flounders, Eider Ducks and       
 Shelducks, feed on Lugworms, Cockles, 
 Mussels, Shrimps and Snails. When the 
 mudflats are exposed, they provide a  
 feeding ground for wading birds; e.g. 
 Godwits, Oyster Catchers and Plovers. 
 Many migrant wading birds visit the   
 area and in winter there are about 60 
 seals. In spring, there are about 20  
 swans.                                
      On the Western fringe of the     
 estuary in the saltmarshes grows a    
 yellow-centred lilac flower called Sea
 Aster, which attracts insects. Seaward
 of this, grows a cactus-like plant    
 called Glasswort, which traps silt to 
 build a new saltmarsh. Cord Grass     
 planted in 1948 has spread onto the   
 mudflats, smothering the flora.       </content>
