		<title>07MOVING IN BY AVISHAI &amp; CALUM</title>
		<content> We moved here in July 1984.We had     
 stayed in a rented house in{Edinburgh 
 and before that in an old house in    
{Eskdalmuir,}Dumfries-shire.We moved   
 here because of the forestry and also 
 to be near the sea.                   
   We chose this part of the{North West
{Highlands }because of the  exciting   
 landscape.Our particular house has a  
 magnificent view of the mountains and 
 the sea. We can also grow some of our 
 own food and keep some animals on our 
 own land.                             
   We now attend a school with only    
 eight pupils. We prefer being in a    
 smaller school because you have more  
 use of the{computer.}We also like this
 school because we get more fun in     
 class.One of the things we would like 
 to see changed is that we do not have 
 enough proper ground to play on, our  
 playground is too small and bumpy!    </content>
