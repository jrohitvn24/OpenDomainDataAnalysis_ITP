		<title>09BIBLE CONFERENCE CENTRE</title>
		<content> The area was originally a farm-now it 
 is a conference centre for people from
 all walks of life-ministers,children, 
 handicapped people and O.A.P.s.The    
 centre will eventually be able to     
 cater for 70 residents.Twenty-eight   
 countries worldwide are involved with 
 the Bible Club.                       
    For a one night stay at the centre 
 the price is Â£2.00 per night per      
 person on a self-catering basis.There 
 are indoor and outdoor activities from
 swimming to hill climbing as well as  
 the religious meeting.There are twenty
 two groups in Renfrewshire contacted  
 by the Bible Club.At the moment the   
 workers at the centre,who are from the
 Manpower Services Commission,are in   
 the process of converting an old barn 
 into another dormitory.
