		<content>  MUCH OF THE ENTERTAINMENT THAT PEOPLE
 ENJOY IS TO BE FOUND IN WATCHING      
 TELEVISION PROGRAMMES. ANY OTHER      
 ENTERTAINMENT HAS TO BE SELF MADE AS  
 THERE ARE NO CINEMAS OR THEATRES IN   
 THE AREA.                             
  THERE ARE DRAMATIC SOCIETIES, CHOIRS 
 AND OTHER ORGANISATIONS WHICH PRODUCE 
 PLAYS AND CONCERTS FROM TIME TO TIME  
 BUT THESE ARE MAINLY BASES AT         
 LOCHGILPHEAD.                         
  THERE ARE, OF COURSE, PEOPLE FROM THE
 VILLAGE WHO BELONG TO THESE           
 ORGANISATIONS AND MOST OF THE         
 VILLAGERS SUPPORT ANY PRODUCTIONS OR  
 PERFORMANCES.                         
  GLASSARY SCHOOL PRODUCES A PLAY,     
 MUSICAL OR A NATIVITY PLAY EACH YEAR  
 AT CHRISTMAS. THIS IS USUALLY         
 PERFORMED IN THE{LACHLAN MILLER HALL  
 TO A CAPACITY AUDIENCE.               
                                       </content>
