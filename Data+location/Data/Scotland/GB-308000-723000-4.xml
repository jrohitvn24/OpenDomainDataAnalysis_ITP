		<content> S  {Letham and Muirton}are large post-
 war council housing schemes of semi-  
 detached and flatted accommodation.   
 Letham's population is over 10,000 and
 it was found that 1.7% of households  
 had no hot water tap, 3.5% no fixed   
 bath, and 3% no inside lavatory.      
    Local clusters of amenities have   
 been provided in the form of shops,   
 churches, dental and doctors'         
 practices with better provision in the
 most recent 1970's development in     
 North Muirton.                        
   {New estates}of privately owned     
 timber frame houses and few amenities 
 have spread south west at an alarming 
 rate, encroaching on the surrounding  
 farmland. In the Oakbank area 2 small 
 shops serve an area of 2 square       
 kilometres. The new by-passes to the  
 south and west of the city may be the 
 only barrier to this development.     </content>
