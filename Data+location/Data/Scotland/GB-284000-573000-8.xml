		<title>08A75 EURO-ROUTE NEAR SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   The A75 goes through our block. It  
 is called the Euro-route. It is a     
 small part of the route from Ireland  
 to Europe and runs from Stranraer to  
 Gretna.                               
                                       
   The traffic is mainly lorries and   
 holiday traffic going across to       
 Ireland by ferry. It is very noisy and
 at times can be heard from the        
 village, especially at night. Traffic 
 passes school to get to the A75.      
                                       
   There are many accidents on the     
 road. Some are caused by foreign      
 drivers driving on the wrong side of  
 the road. The road goes through many  
 villages and small towns where the    
 speed limit is reduced to 30 or 40mph.
 Not many drivers stick to these speed 
 limits.                               
                                       </content>
