		<title>14RECREATION CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content>{IN SCHOOL:}We have a footbal league at
 lunch time. There are five teams. We  
 each have four games to play. For each
 match you win you get two points and  
 if you draw you get one point. We also
 play games such as hide and seek and  
 chasing. We play a game which we call 
 rounders which is similar to cricket  
 but has four stumps. Mostly the girls 
 play skipping and sevenses. In this   
 game you throw a ball against a wall  
 and catch it. At Gym we get long jump,
 throwing the cricket ball, high jump, 
 shot putt, relay, 100m, and the 200m. 
{AT HOME:}When we are at home we play  
 zarres. One person is 'it' and has to 
 catch everyone else to make someone   
 else it. At home many people play on  
 bikes. Football, golf, tennis, bowls  
 and badmington are popular games with 
 local children. Some people play games
 on their computers and pocket toys.   </content>
