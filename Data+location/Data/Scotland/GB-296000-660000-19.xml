		<title>19SHALE BINGS</title>
		<content>    Wherever you go in and around The  
 Breich Valley you can't help noticing 
 large mounds of red stonewhich are a  
 symbol of the former prosperity of the
 area.They are bings of shale          
 stone.They are the remains of the oil 
 bearing shale rock which was mined in 
 the area until the early sixties when 
 it became unprofitable.After it was   
 dug up the rock underwent a number of 
 processes until all the oil was taken 
 out.The stone that was left over was  
 thrown into a heap which just grew and
 grew into the large mounds which      
 dominate the landscape today.Some of  
 these bings are now beginning to      
 disappear however because builders    
 have found that the stone is useful   
 as a foundation for road and pavement 
 building.                             
                                       
                                       </content>
