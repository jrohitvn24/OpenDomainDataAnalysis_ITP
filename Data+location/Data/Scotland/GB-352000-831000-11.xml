		<content> Apart from the actual village, the    
 homes are fairly scattered. About ten 
 years ago most people would have      
 worked on farms or in the forests. Now
 many different occupations are        
 represented. Many women are in        
 full-time employment. The majority  of
 people (13) still work on farms,with  
 commuting teachers/lecturers (6+1)    
 next in number:next come shop         
 assistants (6).There are two building 
 contractors and 4 workers,1 lorry     
 contractor,3 drivers,3 secretaries and
 3 forestry workers. Three young men   
 are trainee bakers,2 people live and  
 work in the local hotel,2 in the Post 
 Office (1 of whom is a full time      
 postman),and 2 men work with Northern 
 Marts. One bank clerk, one doctor (on 
 locum duty),2 oil-rig workers,several 
 unemployed,retired, and housewives    
 complete the total.                   </content>
