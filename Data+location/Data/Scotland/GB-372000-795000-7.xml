		<title>07A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MARIE</title>
		<content> As a waitress I serve the tourists    
 tea, cakes, pancakes, snacks, etc.,   
 then clear and re-lay the tables. We  
 try to get everyone out by 6 o'clock  
 so that we can brush and hoover the   
 floor. For all this I earn Â£40 per    
 week plus tips.                       
 After work on a Saturday I go home,   
 have a shower and go into Banchory    
 with three of my friends. We go to the
 Douglas Arms Hotel where we sit and   
 speak to our friends while drinking { 
{Coca-Cola}until midnight. I usually   
 get a taxi home but sometimes my      
 mother comes to collect me.           
 Although I enjoy Saturday nights,     
 Friday nights are better as we go to a
 local discotheque which is always     
 great fun as we all enjoy dancing.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
