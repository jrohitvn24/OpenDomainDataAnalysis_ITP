 During July and August it is          
 possible to earn some money from      
 "berrypicking" ,usually raspberries,  
 or sometimes strawberries.            
   You must begin early in the morning,
 take a packed lunch and a piece of    
 string to tie the fruit baskets around
 your waist. At the field you must     
 begin work immediately.               
   Picking berries is hard work under a
 hot sun but it's worth it, and at     
 twelve pence a basket it is possible  
 to earn up to Â£10 a day depending on  
 how fast you pick, and how big the    
 crop is.                              
   The berries are transported to      
 Forfar, Montrose or Dundee to be      
 canned, frozen or made into jam."PICK 
 YOUR OWN" is also possible.
