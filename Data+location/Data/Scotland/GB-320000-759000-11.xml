		<content> The Women's Rural Institute is held in
 Glenisla Hall once a month and is     
 well attended, with guest speakers    
 talking about a wide variety of       
 subjects. An outdoor recreational     
 centre provides the opportunity to    
 participate in pony trekking, sailing,
 grass-skiing,archery,abseiling with   
 cross-country and downhill skiing in  
 winter. One of the two local hotels   
 also runs a pony trekking centre.     
 Discos are held in the Glen for the   
 entertainment of the younger          
 generation. Both hotels provide the   
 locals with a meeting place in which  
 to socialise and meet visitors to the 
 Glen. Clay-pigeon shoots are regularly
 enjoyed and arranged by the Glenisla  
 Gun Club.
