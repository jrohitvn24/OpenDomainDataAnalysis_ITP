		<title>01DESCRIPTION OF AREA</title>
		<content> The section we are reviewing is one of
 the most beautiful rural and coastal  
 areas in this part of Scotland. It    
 contains the greater part of {Lunan   
{Bay}renowned for its stretch of sandy 
 beach which "sings" when walked on.   
 The coast line at the north-east ends 
 in cliffs but the rest ends in sand-  
 hills covered by morran grass. Apart  
 from this ground, the rest of the area
 is good arable land, six farms having 
 part of their acreage in this section.
 There are some well established hedges
 and copses in this undulating country 
 side. The landward area is thinly     
 populated with farm houses and        
 cottages, approximately 100 people    
 living within it.The greatest         
 concentration of population is at     
 Braehead of Lunan, in the village of  
 Lunan where there are six blocks of   
 Dorran-Tarran houses, plus cottages.  </content>
