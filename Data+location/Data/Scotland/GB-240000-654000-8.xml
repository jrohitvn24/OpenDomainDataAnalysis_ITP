		<content>   The area provides little employment 
 beyond a variety of farming, thus its 
 commuter population moves out daily to
 Glasgow, Barrhead, Paisley and        
 Kilmarnock and places further afield. 
   The commuters include professionals 
 such as accountants, architects, civil
 servants, quantity surveyors, brokers,
 lawyers, bankers and insurance agents.
   From education there are primary and
 secondary teachers, college and       
 university lecturers and professors of
 conveyancing and physics.             
   Medically we have doctors, dentists,
 nurses, a pharmacist and a vet.       
   The retail trade provides meat and  
 vegetable wholesalers, newsagents, car
 dealers, whisky salesmen and drapers. 
   We have manufacturers of leather,   
 thread and furniture. We have oilrig  
 workers and artists.
