		<title>19THE AUTHORS - BALQUHIDDER</title>
		<content> This project was carried out by the   
 children and teacher of Balquhidder   
 School with the support of the Local  
 Studies Adviser of Central Regional   
 Council's Education Department and the
 encouragement of the parents. Special 
 thanks is due to the residents in the 
 Glen who came in to school to answer  
 the children's questions and who      
 allowed the school access to their    
 properties. The children's love of    
 their homeland speaks for itself in   
 the song which they wrote and set to  
 music entitled "In Praise of          
 Balquhidder". Lastly thanks is due to 
 our local authoress, Elizabeth        
 Beauchamp, whose book "The Braes of   
 Balquhidder" was used as a reference.
