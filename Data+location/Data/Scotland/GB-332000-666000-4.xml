		<content> Newbattle Abbey is a College of       
 Education for adults who have no      
 formal educational qualifications and 
 are over the age of 20. Students stay 
 at the Abbey for 2 years and study for
 a diploma in such subjects as History,
 Economics and English Literature. The 
 Abbey has 85 students, of whom 65 are 
 in residence and 6 teachers. The      
 students come from all over Britain   
 and also from abroad.                 
                                       
                                       
 The College is situated on the site   
 of an old Cistercian Abbey on the     
 lands of Lord Lothian but is run by   
 the Government which in the main is   
 responsible for the allocation of     
 grants to students from Britain.
