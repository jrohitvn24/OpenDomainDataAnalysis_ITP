		<title>07Moving to Ythanwells</title>
		<content> We moved to Ythanwells in January 1985
 when my husband's change of job made  
 us leave Yorkshire. His work is based 
 in Dyce,so he has a 40 minute journey 
 by car each morning and evening.As    
 property prices and rates are extreme-
 ly  high in Aberdeen, we had  to look 
 further afield where prices are lower,
 hence our arrival at Ythanwells Cot-  
 age.It is small, but has potentials   
 for an extension.We have a pumped     
 water supply from a well and drain-   
 age via a septic tank.I found this    
 strange at first,having always lived  
 in a town!The neighbours have made us 
 very welcome and the countryside is   
 beautiful. Our only reservations about
 moving here are the bad snow in winter
 which cuts us off, and occasional     
 feelings of isolation as it is so     
 quiet. However, our views may change  
 as we get accustomed to country life. </content>
