		<content> In the centre of Govan there is a pub 
 called Brechin's Bar.  Attached to the
 guttering there is a stone cat        
 twisting round to catch a rat.  It is 
 believed that Govan will cease to     
 exist when the cat falls down.        
    Govan High School staged a show and
 entertainment, including Madame       
 Krystle, the fourtune-teller, a       
 teacher disguised, sitting in an      
 incense haze.  Her prophecies were    
 repeated in all seriousness, although 
 much altered in the re-telling.       
    In front of Govan Old Parish Church
 is a grave yard known as the 'gravey',
 said to be haunted by 'Baldy Apple',  
 who died choking on an apple.  He     
 trails through the graveyard,         
 coughing, choking and spluttering.    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
