		<title>05Open Cast Mining.</title>
		<content>    The open cast pit just outside{    
{Loanhead}is privately owned by Anglo  
 Scottish Minerals of{Denny}           
 Stirlingshire.                        
    The pit is on the{West Edge}Farm   
 land, which is owned by Mr Robertson, 
 and has been worked on for nearly 2   
 years.                                
   Four men and four vehicles work on  
 the seven acres of land.              
    The  coal is transported in huge   
 lorries to Alloa where it is used in  
 the power stations.                   
 The project still has another 2 years 
 left, but on completion a new by pass 
 will sit on the land that was once    
 mined by  monks who lived there       
 centuries ago.
