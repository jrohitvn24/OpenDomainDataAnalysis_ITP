 Many new people come to live in East  
 Calder every year. They come because  
 they can travel to their work easily  
 in nearby Livingston or Edinburgh.    
 People also come to East Calder       
 because the houses are cheaper than   
 in Edinburgh-Â£44,000 for a three      
 bedroomed detached house.             
  Leech,Wimpey and Bellway all built on
 farmer's land.The builders  built on  
 36% of Langton Farm in 1978.Now the   
 farmer sometimes has vandalism from   
 the local people.He has had a fire in 
 one of his barns in which he lost hay,
 a combine harvester and tractor.
