		<title>09THE HEALTH CENTRE</title>
		<content>    I have been watching the Health    
 Centre for the past few months and I  
 think it is getting on well .In August
 1984 it was only a few bricks .In     
 December it was a bit bigger .Now it  
 is full sized .I took pictures of it  
 ,our teacher took slides of it .Now we
 are getting to the roof .First there  
 was nothing then there was pieces of  
 wood .Now the tiles are getting put on
 ,one roof is finished ,now they have  
 to fill in the other roof ,put windows
 ,doors in and the new site agent hopes
 to finish in September .The health    
 centre is in the middle of a busy     
 shopping area with houses for old     
 people at the back and surrounded by  
 other blocks of houses .Near at hand a
 pharmacy is being built and a short   
 distance away are the primary schools 
 ,the community centre and a bus garage
 .                                     </content>
