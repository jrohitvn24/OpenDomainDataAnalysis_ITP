		<content> In 1965, the Hydro Electric Station,  
 which replaced a generating station,  
 started to be used as the main power  
 source of electricity from the        
 National grid, for Wick and the       
 surrounding area.This area covers the 
 whole of Caithness and the north of   
 Sutherland.From the station the total 
 power output is 11000 kilowatts.Here  
 the voltage is stepped down and is    
 transmitted by underground cables for 
 domestic use.Generally the peak       
 hour of usage is 5.00pm.              
   The station, which is situated just 
 outside Wick, is conveniently close to
 the main road.There is a line with a  
 low voltage, which is used for men to 
 practise on.During winter the main    
 cause of power cuts is the weight of  
 ice causing not only cables but also  
 telegraph poles to snap.
