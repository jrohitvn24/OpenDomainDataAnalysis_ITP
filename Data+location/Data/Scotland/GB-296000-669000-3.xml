		<content> floats and uniformed organisations.   
      Balbardie Primary School also    
 make a decorated float.   This year it
 was Treasure Island.   Work started in
 February.   It is all made of paper   
 mache - this is paste and paper.      
      The judging is held before the   
 Procession starts.   This year (1985) 
 there were about ten floats.   Also in
 the morning the judging of the        
 decorated houses and premises takes   
 place.   People decorate houses and   
 premises with spruce and paper        
 flowers, usually an arch is erected.  
      After the Procession, sports are 
 held in the Meadowpark.   At night    
 people go to the fairground.   There  
 are lots of different rides and also  
 many things to win.   Late at night   
 there is a torchlight procession which
 precedes a Grand Fireworks display to 
 end the day.                          </content>
