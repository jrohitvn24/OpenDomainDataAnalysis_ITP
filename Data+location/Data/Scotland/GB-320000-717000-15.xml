		<title>15Sheltered Homes - Newburgh</title>
		<content>    Newburgh has sheltered housing     
 right in the middle of the town. The  
 sheltered homes were built in 1981.   
 There are seventeen occupants and two 
 wardens _ Mrs Kidd and another person.
 Mrs Kidd lives in one of the houses.  
 They are situated where the Public    
 Hall used to be. It was also a cinema 
 and films were shown there. It is     
 mostly elderly people of 65 or more   
 who live there. Each person has a     
 button which they can press if the    
 warden is needed. The warden helps    
 with the house work, but does the     
 washing most of the time.             
 The sheltered homes are such a pretty 
 sight,                                
 They built them with all their might, 
 Brick by brick,                       
 Layer by layer,                       
 The sheltered homes are such a pretty 
 sight.                                </content>
