		<title>02LIMERIGG CROFTING 1</title>
		<content> In the 12 sq.km.surrounding Limerigg  
 village,there are 5 farms,one of which
 is more appropriately called a croft  
 because it is less than 60 acres. The 
 croft is called Holehousemuir and is  
 owned by Mr and Mrs Kay. They and     
 their handicapped son have lived there
 since 1951.                           
 It is mostly Mrs Kay who works the    
 croft. In years gone by,she kept dairy
 cows and sold their milk sometimes in 
 form of cheese. However when the      
 pasteurization laws came into force   
 she decided to concentrate on beef    
 cattle. Nowadays,her 35 acres are     
 mainly used as pasture for her 20 beef
 cattle and some calves. She also keeps
 2 cockerels a few bantams,and some    
 dogs and cats. She works long hours   
 each day,tending to the needs of the  
 cattle,her family and the general     
 running of the croft.                 </content>
