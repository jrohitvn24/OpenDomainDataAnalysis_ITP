		<title>05PORT OF MENTEITH INCHMAHOME</title>
		<content> It is thought that the masons employed
 at Inchmahome came from the building  
 of the Cathedral Kirk of Dunblane.    
  The earliest buildings date from the 
 mid thirteenth century. For the past  
 five years there has been a group of  
 workmen repairing the ruins to make   
 them safe for visitors and to prevent 
 further decay. About 3000 people visit
 the island each year.                 
{ Mary Queen of Scots}was brought to   
 the island for safety in 1544 when    
{Henry VIII}attacked and burned        
 Edinburgh and surrounding districts   
 towards Stirling. Mary was taken      
 secretly from Inchmahome and sent to  
 France a few weeks later.
