 lying equidistant between the large   
 manufacturing towns of Kilmarnock &amp;   
 &amp; Irvine.   It is sparsely populated, 
 consisting mainly of large dairy      
 farms.   In the SE and SW corners, it 
 includes parts of the industrial      
 villages of springside and            
 Knockentiber, testimony to the        
 extensive coal mining industry which  
 is now defunct and whose workings are 
 mostly returned to farm use it is     
 served by a network of narrow minor   
 roads which bear little traffic.   A  
 disused railway diagonally bisects the
 area and is converted to a walkway for
 leisure use.   The hamlet of          
 Cunninghamhead comprises farms,       
 industrial buildings and a recent     
 housing development; however, the

 agriculture or outside the area in    </content>
