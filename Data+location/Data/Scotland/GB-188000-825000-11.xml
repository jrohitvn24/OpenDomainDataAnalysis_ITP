		<title>11TOURISM IN DORNIE</title>
		<content> Tourism is important because it sells 
 the area and brings money in.It is an 
 industry all on its own,working       
 alongside fishing and crofting.If     
 there was no tourism then there would 
 be no hotels or bed and breakfast     
 places.Tourists come for the beautiful
 scenery in the area.They come to      
 climb,walk,fish and sail.Most tourists
 come from abroad-especially America   
 and Australia but also France,Germany 
 and England.The majority of tourists  
 go to Kyle or Skye but stop in Dornie 
 to see Eilean Donan Castle.South West 
 Ross and Skye is the third largest    
 tourist area in Scotland after        
 Edinburgh and Inverness.The area needs
 tourists so they can go home to       
 encourage their friends to come to    
 visit this beautiful place.
