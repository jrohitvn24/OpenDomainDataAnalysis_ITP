		<title>17CHILDREN'S PASTIMES.</title>
		<content> We issued  Questionnaire sheets to the
 pupils at{Ceres Primary School.}From  
 the information given in these we     
 discovered children in Ceres have a   
 wide range of hobbies from horse      
 riding to dancing.Some of the most    
 popular recreations are{horse riding, 
{swimming, highland dancing,           
{gymnastics, majorettes, football and  
{badminton.}We also found out that the 
 pupils went to quite a lot of clubs in
{Ceres}and{Cupar.}The ones in{Ceres}are
{Cubs, Scouts, Brownies, Guides and    
{Football.}In{Cupar}they are{Swimming  
{and Athletics.}The children think that
 the shops in Ceres are good but they  
 do their{main shopping in either Cupar
{or Dundee.}Most of the children       
 preferred to live in a village rather 
 than a town because it is quieter.
