		<content> Although Tomintoul is a very small    
 village there are quite a lot of      
 sports facilities available locally.  
 In the winter there is skiing at the  
 Lecht which is about 7 miles          
 away.There is also a Rifle Club, a    
 Badminton Club, and an Indoor Bowling 
 Club available in the village halls.  
 The summer offers a wide range of     
 outdoor activities for all the        
 family.This includes grouse           
 shooting,deer stalking,clay pigeon    
 shooting,hill-walking,tennis and pony 
 trekking.Also there is fishing in the 
 River Avon and the Conglass Water.The 
 Avon has mostly salmon and the        
 Conglass mostly small trout.You need a
 permit for the Avon but not for the   
 Conglass.For such a small village     
 Tomintoul has got quite a lot to offer
 people interested in sport.
