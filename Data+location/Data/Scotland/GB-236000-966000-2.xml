		<title>02SHOPS IN DURNESS</title>
		<content>   In Durness there are three shops.   
 Two of them are general merchants, the
 other one is a gift shop. The Mace    
 shop stocks some clothing as well as  
 food. It also has the Post Office in  
 it. The other shop,Mather's, is an    
 old-fashioned grocers shop.  The gift 
 shop sells souveniers,hand knitting,  
 rugs, books and wool.                 
  Until about 50 years ago the         
 deliveries to Durness came by steamer 
 to Portnacon or Rispond. The          
 deliveries were then taken to the     
 shops by horse and cart. Today        
 deliveries are by lorry from Inverness
 or Wick.                              
  For most non-food items many people  
 use mail order catalogues or make an  
 occasional trip to Inverness or       
 Thurso.
