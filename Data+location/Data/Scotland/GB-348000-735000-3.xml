		<content> Private housing in the two villages   
 takes the form of either individual   
 development or small parcels of land  
 having been developed by local, rather
 than national, building firms. The    
 location in bonny countryside and the 
 proximity to Dundee are the two main  
 factors in play here. This is         
 reflected in the type of first time   
 occupiers of these new houses. They   
 tend to be either newly retired       
 couples who have settled finally in a 
 "place in the country", or young      
 married couples who are upward mobile,
 many of whom may move again as        
 dictated by the husband's employment. 
 In the most recent private development
 in Newbigging, completed only this    
 year, 4 out of 21 houses have already 
 changed hands. This is in contrast to 
 the more settled population of the    
 council houses.                       </content>
