 children between the ages of 4 and 12 
 who live mainly in the Parish of      
 Inveravon.Secondary pupils attend     
 Speyside High School in nearby        
 Aberlour. Inveravon School is a rural 
 school with 24 pupils meantime and 2  
 teachers helped by several visiting   
 teachers.Pupils come from a fairly    
 wide area, some travelling as much as 
 6 miles each way.Because of its

 and much-admired view overlooking the 
 Spey valley and the little white      
 church nestling below.In addition to
