		<content>  The appearance of the town has       
 improved over the last 20 years.Many  
 old houses have been renovated.The    
 Castlegate closes stretching back from
 the street have won a Saltire award   
 from Civic Trust and Europa Nostra    
 award.The Canongate looked derelict   
 till new shops with interesting arches
 and houses above were built.There is  
 beautiful stonework houses in the     
 Castlegate the older part of the town.
 At the top of the doorways there are  
 many date stones.Behind the High      
 Street there is sheltered housing with
 a scented garden.The colours of some  
 houses in the Market Square and       
 Canongate are the colours of Autumn   
 leaves.There are many large stone-    
 built houses on the fringe of the     
 town.Council houses are very          
 attractive and varied in style.
