 The second of the four farms we       
 studied was Townhead Farm Holytown. It
 has 300 acres which is all            
 owned.This farm also concentrated on a
 mixture of dairy and arable           
 farming.Their livestock consisted of  
 dairy cattle-fresian,which they milked
 twice a day, at 5.45am and 3.45 pm .  
                                       
  The soil type of the farm was medium 
 and they sold most of their           
 products,oats,barley,wheat,milk and   
 straw,with the exception of grass     
 which they used themselves for silage 
 .                                     
 The farm employed six people,four of  
 which were part-time workers,and they 
 had all the usual type of machinery.
