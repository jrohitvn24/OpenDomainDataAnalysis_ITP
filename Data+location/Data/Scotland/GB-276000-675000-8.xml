		<title>08RECREATION IN CUMBERNAULD</title>
		<content> There are lots of things to do in     
 Cumbernauld to use up your free time. 
 There are many clubs and sports that  
 children, teenagers and adults can    
 take part in. In Abronhill you'll find
 clubs, churches, shops, a leisure     
 centre and a library. If you want to  
 go out for the day with the family    
 then you could go to Palacerigg       
 Country Park which is just south if   
 Abronhill. There are many different   
 kinds of animals like wolves, highland
 cattle and deer which are kept there. 
 There is also a golf club with a club-
 house for members. For BMX fans there 
 are a few runs near to the village of 
 Cumbernauld which also has a fair in  
 the summer and sometimes a circus. The
 Tryst Sports Centre which is in the   
 Town Centre has 2 swimming pools,     
 judo, karate, saunas, squash courts   
 and trampolining.                     </content>
