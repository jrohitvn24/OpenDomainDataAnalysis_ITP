		<title>18Traditional Diet of Papa.</title>
		<content> Fish,mutton,potatoes,kale (cabbage)   
 and bere meal were the staple foods   
 of the Shetland diet.                 
   Now more exotic foods are imported  
 and bere (a sort of multi-grained     
 barley) is not grown much.The tiny    
 water mills that were used to grind it
 are still dotted about the islands,   
 Papa has more than a dozen.           
   Visitors are often perplexed by the 
 round stone enclosures sprinkled over 
 the island.These are the planti-crubs 
 where crofters sow their kale seed.The
 plants over-winter in these harsh     
 conditions,ready for planting out in  
 the yards in spring.It is an important
 fodder crop as well as a valuable     
 source of vitamin C for humans.       
   Fish and mutton have always played  
 an important part in our diet either  
 fresh,or dried and salted.Numerous    
 varieties of potatoes are cultivated. </content>
