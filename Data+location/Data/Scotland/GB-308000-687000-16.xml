		<content> Vandalism in Dunfermline is becoming  
 more  prevalent every day.  For       
 instance, the new bus station which   
 opened early this year has already had
 two and a half thousand pounds worth  
 of damage done to it.   In the Public 
 Park, swings have been wound round the
 top bar, the chutes and roundabouts   
 have graffiti everywhere and other    
 playthings have been broken or        
 damaged.  Flower beds which are       
 carefully looked after by gardiners   
 are trampled on and overturned by     
 careless people.  Dogs being allowed  
 to run loose cause another problem.   
    Toilets in the Glen and Park have  
 been damaged and written on so much   
 that the Council sometimes have to    
 close them down.  Public shelters are 
 vandalised and visitors can be put off
 by the graffiti and mess.
