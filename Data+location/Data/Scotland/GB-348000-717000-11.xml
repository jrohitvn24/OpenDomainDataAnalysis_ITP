		<content> The Martyrs' monument is an obelisk   
 45ft. high and it was erected in 1842 
 to commemorate the martyrs who were   
 burned to death between 1528-1558.    
 They were Patrick Hamilton, Henry     
 Forrest,George Wishart and Walter     
 Mill. At that time, St.Andrews was the
 ecclesiastical capital of Scotland and
 was the centre of the religious       
 struggles before the Reformation.     
                                       
 A monument to the South of the R.&amp; A. 
 commemorates Lord Lyon Playfair of    
 St.Andrews, PC,GCB,LLD,FRS.(1828-1898)
 His career was a combined devotion to 
 science and a rare dedication to      
 public welfare. His parliamentary     
 career began in 1868 when he was      
 elected Liberal member of the newly   
 created Scottish University seat of   
 St.Andrews and Edinburgh.
