		<content>     I spoke to my great uncle Alex    
 about what it was like here when he   
 was a young boy. He is 72 now and he  
 has always lived in Queenzieburn.     
     The children were afraid of the   
 teachers, who strapped them on the    
 hand when they were bad. Out of school
 they played games we still play       
 today-skipping,football,peevers,kick  
 the can,hide and seek,rounders and    
 cricket.                              
     At the time he started work down  
 the pit there were 9 pits around the  
 district. Now there are none. His     
 first wage was 3 shillings and 4 pence
 (about 17p). A loaf cost fourpence and
 a dozen eggs cost sixpence(2p and 3p).
    Although people had little money   
 and fewer luxuries in his young days  
 my great uncle Alex says people were  
 more contented than they are nowadays.
