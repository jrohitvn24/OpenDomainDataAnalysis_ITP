		<title>10ODD FACTS ON THE OLD COURSE</title>
		<content>  The hump-backed stone bridge over the
 Swilken burn, on the 18th fairway is  
 the oldest structure in St.Andrews    
 which has been in constant use. It is 
 thought to be 800 years old and was   
 once the only link between the town   
 and the safe harbour in the Eden      
 Estuary.                              
 The Old Course originally had 22 holes
 and began and ended at the top of the 
 hill near St.James' Church. Only in   
 1836, when the R.&amp; A.was given a site 
 for their clubhouse, was it reduced   
 to 18 holes.                          
 When The Captain of the R.&amp; A."plays  
 himself in", each September, at the   
 start of his year of office, he drives
 a ball from the 1st Tee and all the   
 caddies race to retrieve it. The      
 winner receives a gold sovereign which
 now has to be minted specially for the
 R.&amp; A.                                </content>
