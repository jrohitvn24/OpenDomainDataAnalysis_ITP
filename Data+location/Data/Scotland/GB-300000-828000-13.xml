		<title>13SKIING NEAR GRANTOWN</title>
		<content> Grantown-on-Spey is a good centre for 
 skiing as it lies between the two main
 skiing grounds in North East Scotland,
 Cairngorms and the Lecht.  Both lie   
 within 40km of the town.              
                                       
 The Lecht, on the road to Aberdeen, is
 well suited to the beginner and       
 intermediate skier, having gentler and
 shorter runs.  It is also quieter and 
 cheaper than Cairngorm.               
                                       
 The Cairngorms is Britain's premier   
 winter sports centre, with a complex  
 of runs.  Cross country skiing is also
 catered for.  Both sites have cafe and
 toilet facilities.                    
                                       
 Skis may be hired from Speyside Sports
 in Grantown, at the Lecht ski grounds,
 and in Aviemore and Carrbridge on the 
 way to the Cairngorms.                </content>
