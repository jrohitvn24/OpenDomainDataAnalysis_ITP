		<title>13Origins of Irvine Marymass</title>
		<content> During the{Middle Ages,}the people who
 lived in Irvine worked for their      
 feudal lord and the only time off work
 was for religious festivals or{Holy   
{Days.}The Holy Days in Irvine were in 
 the third week in August each year. On
 the Saturday of that week, everyone   
 went to church to say a{mass}to the   
 Virgin Mary. In the afternoon everyone
 went to the town common{(Irvine Moor)}
 for an afternoon of sport- a{Medieval 
{Fair.}This was the start of our       
{Marymass Festival}which is still held 
 on the Saturday following the third   
 Monday in August each year.
