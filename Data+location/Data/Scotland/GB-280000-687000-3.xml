		<content> This has traditionally been a mining  
 area. There are few miners in the     
 villages now. The nearest working mine
 is Polmaise near Fallin but it is     
 under threat of closure (which was one
 of the reasons for the recent miners' 
 strike). Farmers are employing fewer  
 workers because of more sophisticated 
 farming machinery. Children           
 traditionally worked at the potato    
 lifting in the autumn but this is also
 done by machinery now. Some villagers 
 used to work in the cigarette factory 
 in Stirling that closed because of a  
 drop in sales. With the closing of    
 Carron Iron Works and Iron foundries  
 in Larbert many men in the area became
 unemployed.
