		<title>01Glen Girnock and The Dee</title>
		<content> The area lies approximately half way  
 between Ballater and Crathie on the   
 south side of the River Dee in the    
 Upper Deeside. It is sparsely         
 populated. Most houses in Glen        
 Girnock, which provide a natural      
 boundary to the East, West and South  
 of the block are empty or ruinous. The
 hills in the area -Creag nam Ban      
 (rocky hill of hte women) Sea Charlle 
 (The old wood) and Sgor an h Colaire  
 (peak of the eagle) are now bare of   
 trees, craggy and rarely climbed.     
 The south-west corner in the lower    
 ground closer to the Dee is farmed by 
 Abergeldie Estate,the main landowner  
 here. The small population here       
 includes retired estate workers,      
 present estate workers and people     
 residient only in the summer months.  
 Roe deer live here all year round.    
 Hawk, pheasant, grouse and even       </content>
