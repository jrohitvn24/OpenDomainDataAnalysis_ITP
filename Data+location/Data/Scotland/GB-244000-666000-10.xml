		<title>10LIVING NEAR THE AIRPORT</title>
		<content> Life near the Airport is constantly   
 disrupted by aeroplanes arriving and  
 departing at all hours of the day and 
 night.                                
    When I and my family first moved   
 into the area,I thought nothing of it,
 but then I realised how near I was.For
 the first year I had trouble sleeping 
 and I couldn't concentrate when doing 
 my work.We ended up burning out the   
 television trying to drown out the    
 noise!                                
    We haven't any pets as we are      
 frightened that they may suffer from  
 the noise and get injured by running  
 into the Airport grounds.             
    On the other hand,there are        
 advantages.I travel a lot in my work  
 and it is great being only a few      
 moments from your home.               
    Overall,life here is pretty good!
