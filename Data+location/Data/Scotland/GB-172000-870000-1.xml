		<title>01Coastline sth of Gairloch</title>
		<content> Landscape- undulating moorland rising 
 to 110m in south. Rocky coastline with
 sandy bay at Opinan.                  
 People - there are two small crofting 
 setlements at Opinan, and South       
 Erradale. The crofts however are not  
 adequate to provide an income by      
 themselves, and people find work      
 elsewhere when available. They live   
 here because their ancestors lived    
 here,bu they depend heavily upon      
 Gairloch 8 miles away. Many people    
 speak Gaelic. Sunday is srictly       
 observed,there are two small meeting  
 places in the area. The Post Office is
 at Opinan, and there are no other     
 shops, except a craft shop at S.      
 Erradale. Some tweed weaving id done  
 here, to attract the tourist. A coffee
 lounge and a restaurant also have an  
 eye to the tourist. There is some peat
 cutting on the moor for fuel.         </content>
