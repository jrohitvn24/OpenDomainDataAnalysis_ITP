		<title>18Garden Flowers and Trees.</title>
		<content>   Maule Street in Carnoustie was      
 chosen as a guide to the sort of      
 flowers and trees which are most      
 popular in the area.The most common   
 flower which is grown is the rose, red
 and orange being the usual colours.The
 least common were the marsh-marigolds.
 Daffodils are also popular but weren't
 in bloom when the survey was done and 
 the same was true for primroses.      
                                       
   The survey showed that the Japanese 
 Cherry was the most commonly grown    
 tree.This may be because the tree has 
 beautiful blossom and a strong fra-   
 grance which lasts throughout spring. 
 There weren't very many holly trees   
 although their leaves are popular at  
 Christmas time.                       
   The elm and the ash were not grown  
 in any gardens but they can be seen in
 the parks and countryside.            </content>
