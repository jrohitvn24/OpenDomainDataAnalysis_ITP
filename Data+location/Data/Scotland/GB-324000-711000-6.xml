		<title>06FARMING..LANDSCAPE CHANGES</title>
		<content> A major change in the area is that    
 most farmers have converted to arable 
 farming, having sold off almost all   
 their livestock and having increased  
 crop growing facilities.Some small    
 changes have occured on the farms     
 themselves, such as the removal of    
 hedges and trees as field boundaries  
 because of death and decay,           
 inconvenience to farm machinery,      
 economic savings if replaced with     
 fences, salt spray off the roads      
 during winter killing them off and    
 tree roots causing field drainage     
 problems.The introduction of new      
 brassica crops has made a change to   
 the appearence of the landscape       
 especially in June when oilseed rape, 
 is in flower, turning fields yellow.  
 Rossie farm uses a 12 year crop cycle.
