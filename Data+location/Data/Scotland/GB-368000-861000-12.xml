		<title>12A River Walk</title>
		<content>  Today we went for a walk. We went to 
 the river side. We started at the     
 distillery and walked all the way from
 there. The first thing we saw was the 
 horse Heidi. The next thing we saw was
 the big old house. When we went up to 
 the farm we picked some sticky willies
 and we were playing with them. We also
 went along the bank of the golf       
 course. we saw that parts of the bank 
 were falling off and we also saw that 
 the water was not clear. Up a bit from
 the bridge we saw grass cuttings in   
 the water; then up a bit from that the
 water was very rough. I thought it was
 going over stones. When we were on the
 bank by the golf course we had to be  
 quiet because there were people       
 playing golf. On the way back we      
 counted how many steps we took to     
 cross the bridge. I took one hundred  
 and seventy six.                      </content>
