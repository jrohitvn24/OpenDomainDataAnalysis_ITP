		<title>10Leisure in Laggan</title>
		<content> Most of the villagers in Laggan enjoy 
 the activities which take place in the
 new village hall (see social life in  
 Laggan). As well as organised         
 leasure, most people have their own   
 pastimes. Many men enjoy wood-craft   
 and fishing, while women knit and     
 bake - sometimes for country fair     
 competitons. Reading is a popular     
 recreational activity and we are      
 supplied by a fortnightly library van 
 which travels from Fort William. The  
 population follows a wide selection of
 hobbies. The natural facilities are   
 well used for fishing, pony trekking, 
 hill walking, nordic skiing, and bird 
 watching. Choirs and folk music are   
 well supported. Ceilidh dances are a  
 happy family event when impromptu     
 party pieces are performed to allow a 
 rest from rigourous country dances.
