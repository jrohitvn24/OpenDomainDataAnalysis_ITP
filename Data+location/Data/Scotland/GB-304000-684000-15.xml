		<title>15CHRISTOPHER'S GALA DAY</title>
		<content>    June 1st was Crossford Gala Day. I 
 awoke feeling nervous because I was in
 the 5-a-side football final. First I  
 dressed in my pirate outfit, for I was
 to follow the cub float, HMS MARS BAR,
 in the parade down Main Street.       
    Later I changed into my football   
 strip before eating my picnic lunch   
 and going round all the stalls and    
 looking at the displays. Then it was  
 time for my match, the 10s to 12s     
 final. I was playing in goal for my   
 team, had only a few saves to make,   
 but the score was 0-0 at the final    
 whistle. It all depended on penalties!
 Our team scored with their first, so  
 it was up to me to try to save our    
 opponents' shot. I took up my stance  
 on the line, and when I dived I shut  
 my eyes as I didn't want to see the   
 ball go in. But it missed! It went    
 over the bar!{I had won my medal!}    </content>
