		<title>18Wildlife &amp; Yetholm Loch</title>
		<content> This wildlife reserve is the result of
 an agreement between Scottish Wildlife
 Trust and three landowners, after the 
 Nature Conservancy Council had        
 recommended the site of special       
 scientific interest. Signposts        
 discourage visitors, at the south end 
 of the loch, birds nesting include,   
 the willow and the sedge warblers,    
 reed bunting and other visiting song  
 birds. One of the landowners, keen on 
 planting trees has improved the west  
 area for wildlife by willow and alder 
 thickets native trees offering shelter
 and food to small birds. Winter       
 visitors include, mallard, teal,      
 wigeon, goldeneye, pochard, tufted    
 duck, goosander with whooper swans,   
 greylag or pinkfoot geese seen if you 
 are lucky. Rarer are shoveler,        
 pintail and long tailed duck.
