		<content>  Every year the men who sail the      
 Shetland model boats take part in a   
 regatta,held in August.               
  A Shetland model boat is a full-size 
 boat about 4.5m long built to a       
 traditional design.Whalsay's biggest  
 model boat is the"White Wings"and she 
 is over 4.5m long.Most of the Shetland
 model boats are just over 4.3m.       
  Nearly all the men who sail the      
 Shetland model boats go off to the    
 fishing as well and when they are home
 they sail for a hobby.                
 From May til August,on Saturdays and  
 Thursdays the boats sail in points    
 races.A Shetland model boat has a crew
 of three.The races start and finish at
 the harbour entrance.There are about  
 25 Whalsay boats that compete in the  
 sailing.
