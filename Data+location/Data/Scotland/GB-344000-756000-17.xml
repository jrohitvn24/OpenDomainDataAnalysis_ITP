		<title>17Glenogil gamekeeper(cont)</title>
		<content> The Glenogil estate is the home of    
 many red deer.In summer the deer are  
 high in the hills and generally       
 require little attention. However the 
 keeper does watch over them, keeping a
 track of where there favorite feeding 
 and watering spots are and looking out
 for sick animals.                     
 During winter and spring, when natural
 food is scarce, the keeper lays out   
 hay and cattle-cake for the deer.     
 During the shooting season in the     
 autumn, sportsmen come to the estate  
 from many countries to try their hand 
 at "the sport of kings". The keeper   
 takes his clients to places where he  
 can be sure that a good, clean shot   
 can be had. The sportsman can claim   
 the head of his kill and have it      
 mounted as a trophy. All the meat from
 any deer shot is sent to the local    
 game dealer after skinning.           </content>
