		<title>17PEAT-FUEL FOR BURNING 1/2</title>
		<content>  Large parts of Whalsay are covered   
 with peat.The peat varies in depth    
 from under a metre to over 4 metres.  
 The surface of the moor has heather   
 and grasses.Many people on the island 
 use peat as a fuel for heating their  
 houses,even running central heating   
 systems from a peat-burning fire.     
  The places where peat is 'cast' or   
 cut from a peat bank.First the surface
 vegetation or 'fields' are cut off and
 set down in the bottom of the bank,the
  'greff'.A tool called a tushkar is   
 then used to cut the peat.This is a   
 one man job.As the peat is cut it is  
 thrown on the top of the bank.If there
 is deep enough peat a 2nd. peat may be
 cut,this will be built into an open   
 dyke.The peat is then left to dry,    
 shrinking as it does.After a week or  
 two,depending on the weather,the peat 
 will be'raised',built up into heaps.  </content>
