		<content> Before the Tay Rail Bridge was built  
 only farms and scattered houses       
 existed in Wormit and Newport. When   
 the first bridge was built in 1878    
 lots of business people from Dundee   
 settled in Wormit and Newport and so  
 the older houses which now exist      
 started to be built. These houses had 
 big rooms, big windows and elaborate  
 wrought iron decorations.             
 Today 17% of housing in Wormit and    
 Newport is council owned and 83% is   
 privately owned. 10% of the private   
 houses are rented. The modern houses  
 are brick built with harled walls. Any
 spare bit of land is used for building
 new houses.* Some of the big Victorian
 houses have been altered into flats.  
 * Many of the new houses have been    
 specially constructed as sheltered    
 dwellings for old people.
