		<title>07WATER-STANELY RESERVOIR</title>
		<content> The Stanely Reservoir came into       
 service in 1838. It is 31 metres deep 
 and covers an area of 46 acres. It is 
 held in reserve to be used during     
 water shortages.                      
 Stanely Castle, one of the local      
 historic buildings, is within the     
 boundary of the reservoir. It is an   
 'L' shaped structure. The exterior    
 walls are well preserved but the      
 inside is entirely gutted. The land on
 which the castle stands belongs to the
 Earl of Glasgow.                      
 The site of the castle and reservoir  
 gives employment to a small group of  
 local people. There are 2 youth       
 opportunity workers and 4 full time   
 employees. They all work a 38 hour    
 week.One watchman is on night duty.   
 There are a lot of trespassers in     
 what is a dangerous place to play, and
 at least 2 children drowned recently. </content>
