          Viewpark, a former mining    
village ringed round with rich wood-   
land, stands 'up-the-hill' of the      
east bank of the Clyde Valley. 'Doon-  
the-hill' is the more well-to-do       
Uddingston by the Clyde itself.        
          Their combined population    
and that of other areas adjoining is   
around 15,000. Extensive coal-mining   
has entirely given way to a varied     
cross-section of industries which do   
not take up all of the labour force.   
Many workers commute to other towns    
especially Glasgow.                    
          The road network is adequate 
and partly being modernised at present.
It includes the M74 and busy interch-  
ange. The main rail-lines from Glas-   
gow to both Edinburgh and London       
pass through Uddingston.
