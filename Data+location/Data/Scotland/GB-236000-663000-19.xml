		<title>19BRIDGE OF WEIR - RELIGION</title>
		<content>  The oldest church in Bridge of Weir  
 is{Freeland Church,}which was built in
 the{1820's.}The name "{Freeland,}"is  
 connected with {Robert Freeland}who   
 lived in Gryffe Castle (which is now a
 children's home). He owned one of the 
 cotton mills which were once the main 
 industry in Bridge of Weir.           
  There are two{Presbyterian Churches  
 in Bridge of Weir, one{Assembly of the
{Christian Brethern}and an{Episcopal   
 Church. Their names are{Freeland,     
{St.Machar's Ranfurly, St.Mary's}and   
{Hope Hall.                            
  As well as organising church         
 services the elders and the minister  
 also care for the sick, housebound and
 elderly. They comfort the family when 
 a member of the family dies.The church
 also celebrates births and marriages  
 of its members.
