		<title>16Petershill Football Club</title>
		<content>  Petershill Football Club was founded 
 on Friday 4th June 1897.The team has  
 won the Scottish Junior Cup five      
 times.They share the record for       
 winning the cup with Cambuslang       
 Rangers.They almost won the Cup this  
 year when they reached the final      
 again.They played Pollock on Sunday   
 2nd June and it ended in a 1-1 draw.  
 The teams played again at Hampden Park
 the following Tuesday and Pollock beat
 Petershill by three goals to one.     
 Petershill won the Central League in  
 the season of 1983-84 but they were   
 unlucky this year.                    
  Petershill's best strikers are Andy  
 Dailly and Pat Daly.They are both fast
 on their feet and excellent players.  
 They have scored about 40 goals       
 between them this season.Of course    
 goals are not enough and goalkeeper   
 Willie Harvey has played well,too.    </content>
