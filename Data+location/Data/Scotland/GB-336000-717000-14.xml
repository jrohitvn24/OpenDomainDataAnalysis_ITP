		<title>14FARMING..FOODIE FARM</title>
		<content> Foodie farm is situated North of Cupar
 and is approximately 400 acres (160   
 hectares) in size.                    
  The farm has been in the ownership of
 the Ostler family since 1940. The     
 present Mr.Ostler was born and brought
 up on the neighbouring farm and so has
 spent a life time in the area.        
  The farm consists of several         
 outbuildings which have recently been 
 converted into a farm shop which      
 specialises in selling frozen meat    
 produce. Unfortunately the shop has as
 profitable as they hoped due to the   
 increasing avaliability of cheaper    
 cuts in supermarkets. Sales have      
 fallen 9% during the past year.       
  The buildings are subject to a       
 preservation order, and therefore     
 cannot be altered or demolished. In   
 his spare time Mr.Ostler walks around 
 his land, admiring the scenery.       </content>
