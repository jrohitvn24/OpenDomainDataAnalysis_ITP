		<title>07DAIRY FARMING IN SYMINGTON</title>
		<content>                                       
 A dairy farmer was interviewed:       
 Farming today is far better than it   
 used to be,it's still hard work now   
 but we have tractors,diggers,choppers,
 bailers and combiners.The grass in    
 Symington is very good for dairy      
 cattle.There are about 260 cows on the
 farm and another 340 at the old radio 
 station.Our milk is sold to the       
 Scottish Milk Marketing Board.On      
 average we get 1650 litres from one   
 milking time and 3300 from two.I      
 learned to farm from my father before 
 me.I left school at 15 to become a    
 farmer,my son joined me at            
 sixteen.                              
         That's what dairy farming is  
 like in Symington today.
