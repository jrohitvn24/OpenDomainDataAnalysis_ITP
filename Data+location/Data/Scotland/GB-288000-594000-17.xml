 built in Blacknest farm.It remained a 
 nine hole course for 70 years until   
 the 1960s when the Stevens family sold
 the farm to the Duke of Buccleuch.He  
 made it into an 18 hole course,and he 
 turned an old house into a bar and    
 club house for members.The course wsa 
 finally completed in 1972,12 years    
 after it begun.In memory,a rock was   
 placed on top of the hill beside the  
 first hole,with a metal plate which   
 had the dates of completion of both   
 courses on it.There are about 150     
 members today and 21 life members.The 
 par for the course is ladies 74 and
