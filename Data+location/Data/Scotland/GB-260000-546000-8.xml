		<content> Most people live and work on the land,
 but the area also has industries which
 support the farmer. ie blacksmith,    
 fencer, dyker and joiner.             
 The blacksmith, Mr Halliday, was      
 interviewed, and revealed that the    
 smithy was established about 80 years 
 ago.  Then its main job was to shoe   
 the many working horses, and to mend  
 the ploughs.  In the beginning it was 
 a one man business, but now there are 
 six men, plus one apprentice.  The raw
 materials come from Glasgow,          
 Newcastle,  and the Midlands.  The    
 work is rather different now, the men 
 doing steel fabrications besides      
 repairing farm machinery.  Mr Halliday
 thinks that there will always be work 
 for blacksmiths in Borgue, because    
 there will always be farms.
