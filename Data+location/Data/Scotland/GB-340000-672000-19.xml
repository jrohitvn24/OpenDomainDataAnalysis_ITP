		<content>{A DAY IN THE LIFE OF KEVIN AGED 12YRS}
 I wake up about 7.30am,but it takes   
 about ten minutes for me to get my    
 clothes on.I get washed and I clean my
 teeth and go though to the living room
 to get my breakfast of cereal,tea and 
 toast.When I have finished I get ready
 for school.My mum gets my packed lunch
 made up.I leave home about 8.45am.When
 I get to school I play football until 
 the bell 9.00am.I play football at    
 playtime and dinnertime which starts  
 at 12.30pm until 1.30pm after         
 dinnertime there are no more breaks   
 until 3.15pm that is hometime.When I  
 get home I sometimes play on my       
 computer or play football until tea   
 time.After my tea I go to my friends  
 house or play on my bike.I go in at   
 9.00pm and go to bed at 10.00pm.When I
 grow up I would like to be a computer 
 programmer.                           </content>
