		<title>11The Church</title>
		<content>   The church is 169 years old although
 there was a church over at Clachan    
 thought to be built before 1690.      
 Hundreds of visitors from all over the
 world come to see our church because  
 it is octagonal and there is only a   
 handful of churches of that shape.    
 There is an old saying that if you    
 have an octagonal church the Devil    
 can't hide in the corners.            
   There are three churches that the   
 minister works in and they are Carrick
 Castle, Lochgoilhead and Cairndow     
 covering a distance of about thirty   
 miles. The main church is in          
 Lochgoilhead and the minister lives   
 there.                                
   Only about ten people attend the    
 church on a Sunday but if the minister
 lived in Cairndow perhaps more people 
 might come.                           
                                       </content>
