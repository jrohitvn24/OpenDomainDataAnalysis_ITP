		<title>19PETER BUCHAN-BIOGRAPHY</title>
		<content> Our group decided to interview a local
 character so we chose Peter Buchan the
 poet.Peter has always lived in        
 Peterhead and over the years has      
 written many poems about fishing.Peter
 Buchan attended Peterhead Academy and 
 he left school with 6 Highers.Even    
 though he did very well at school     
 Peter thinks he would have been more  
 successful if he had studied          
 more.After he left school,Peter       
 started fishing.His first boat was the
 "Sparkling Star."Peter started writing
 poems when he was 30.He says he gets  
 his inspiration from thinking about   
 past days and also if someone makes a 
 chance remark.Once he makes a start to
 a poem he writes it very quickly.He   
 has written a book of poetry called   
 "Mount Pleasant."Peter Buchan writes  
 his poems for fun and as a hobby.
