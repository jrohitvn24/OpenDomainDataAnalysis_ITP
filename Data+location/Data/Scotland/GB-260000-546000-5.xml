		<content> There are two types of farming        
 prctised in the parish - dairy farming
 and beef.  To begin with, the main    
 product of the dairies was cheese,    
 with butter making a minor trade.  In 
 the 1930's cheese making declined, and
 the opening of the creamery in        
 Kirkcudbright in 1923 accelerated the 
 chnge over from cheese making to the  
 sale of liqiod milk.  With present day
 EEC quotas for milk production, many  
 farmers are putting off their dairy   
 and turning to beef and sheep.  The   
 area is famous for its Galloway       
 cattle, especially the Belted Galloway
 which is a very strong and sturdy     
 beast that can be wintered outside.   
 This breed originated on the exposed  
 uplands of Galloway, and are eminately
 suited for converting rough grazing   
 into lean meat.  They are black or dun
 cattle, with a distinctive white belt.</content>
