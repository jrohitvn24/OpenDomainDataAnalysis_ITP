		<title>04Geology of Papa Stour</title>
		<content> Shetland is very diverse geologically 
 and {Papa Stour}is no exception.The   
 thing that strikes most visitors is   
 the impressive{red}sea cliffs.The     
 caves that occur in the cliffs are    
 second only to Fingal's cave in the   
 Hebrides.These caves can only be seen 
 by boat,they are not otherwise access 
 ible.                                 
    Papa Stour is of {volcanic}origin. 
 Geologists think we were formed by a  
 volcanic eruption in{Ashea Ness}to    
 the North.The base rock is Basalt and 
 outcrops of this are found with gas   
 holes full of interesting minerals.   
  On the East side of Papa Stour sandy 
 beaches are to be found but the West  
 side is dominated by cliffs.We cover  
 an area of 3 square miles but with    
 such an indented coastline that the   
 perimeter is 24 miles,and encompasses 
 many sheltered inlets.                </content>
