 The number of owner-occupier house-   
 holders has increased in recent years.
 The{Trust}has sold{feus}of land of    
 approximately 1/4 acre to interested  
 buyers on which to build their private
 homes. Within the past ten years a new
 housing estate has been built by the  
 local authority consisting of terraced
 houses and flats.  Four years ago     
 additional houses were built on the   
 estate and these are mainly semi-     
 detatched.  We examined the houses    
 village by village and found that in  
 each,the housing was mixed i.e.       
 pre-war 1930 type houses and recently 
 built bungalow type, apart from       
{Marybank}where there is a street of   
 pre-war semi-detached two-storey      
 houses,as well as the crofter-type    
 houses.                               </content>
