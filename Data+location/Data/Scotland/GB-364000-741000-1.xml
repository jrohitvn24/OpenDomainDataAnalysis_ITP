 Our D.Block ia mainly very good farm  
 land, growing mostly cereals,like     
 barley and wheat. Also grown are      
 potatoes, oil seed rape, rasberries,  
 rhubarb and hay.                      
    We also have two and a half square 
  kilometres of the North sea,and      
 around three square kilometres of the 
 main town of Arbroath. In the town    
 patch, we have one of the  most famous
 abbeys in Scotland, where the         
 Declaration of Scottish Independance  
 was signed in 1320.Thousands of       
 tourists come to Arbroath to see the  
 Abbey as well as enjoying a delightful
 clifftop walk along one of the Nature 
 Trails.  Our patch also contains, a   
 new Health Centre, a recently         
 modernised library,a garden centre,   
 four schools, and a variety of council
 houses.                               </content>
