		<title>17Reconstrution of Hampden</title>
		<content> Hampden football stadium belongs to   
 Queen's Park Amateur Football Club.   
 The ground is often used by other     
 clubs in internationals, cup finals   
 and European cup finals.  The stadium 
 has a capacity of 70-75000.  However, 
 just now the ground is being          
 reconstructed.  After the             
 reconstruction the ground will be able
 to hold 85,000.  The reconstruction   
 will cost about Â£2 million.  The money
 will be spent on covering the         
 terracing, new toilets, snack bars,   
 turnstiles and new seating in the     
 stand.  Every time a big game is      
 played at Hampden Queens Park are     
 given 25% of the profit.  This is     
 necessary since Queens Park have such 
 small crowds and it costs about       
 Â£700,000 to run Hampden all season.   
 Tickets for the big games can cost as 
 much as Â£12 for the stand.            </content>
