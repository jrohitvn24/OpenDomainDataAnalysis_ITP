		<content> There are many strange stories about  
 ghosts in and around Kennethmont, but 
 the most common one concerns "The     
 Green Lady". The Green Lady is        
 supposed to live in the Old Graveyard,
 where many people claim to have seen  
 her. The night of July the 10th is    
 supposed to be the night when many    
 ghosts, including the Green Lady, are 
 abroad; but there seems to be no story
 to explain why this should be. The    
 Green Lady is reported to be a young  
 girl wearing a green dress and flowers
 in her hair. In addition, most reports
 state that she wanders barefoot.      
 The stable at Leith Hall is also      
 supposed to be haunted, this time by a
 group of pipers wearing the Campbell  
 tartan. There are occasionally claims 
 that they have been seen marching down
 to Leith Hall or marching in the      
 grounds.                              </content>
