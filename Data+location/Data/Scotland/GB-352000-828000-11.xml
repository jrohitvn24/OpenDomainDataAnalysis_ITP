		<title>11Thirty Years Of Change.</title>
		<content> Kennethmont has changed greatly over  
 the past 30 years. The roads have been
 much improved to suit the needs of    
 modern traffic, being wider,          
 straighter and better surfaced. A more
 mobile population has meant that      
 people now tend to do most of their   
 shopping in the larger centres where  
 they have more choice so there are now
 fewer shops locally. Farming has been 
 mechanised and modernised,resulting in
 fewer workers on the land where many  
 workers cottages now lie derelict.    
 However more houses have been built at
 Kirkhill as the population of the area
 has become more polarised. Distilling 
 methods have changed too, with the    
 emphasis firmly placed more on        
 production of quantity and less on the
 traditional skills of producing a     
 quality Scotch Whisky.              {
