		<content> In our survey to find how many shops  
 in Blantyre and Bothwell use{computers
 we found that{Bothwell}had more shops 
 using them. The types of shops using  
 them were mainly banks &amp; electrical   
 companies as well as a jeweller. The  
 types of shops in {Blantyre}using them
 were more department stores and banks.
 We found that smaller shops like      
 grocers, newsagents didn't use them.  
 Sometimes a shop you would expect to  
 have a computer did not and sometimes 
 the reverse was also the case.
