		<content> Three miles ssouth of the village lies
 the hamlet of Scrabster, where in the 
 mid 1800s the tenants were evicted to 
 make way for sheep. This was during   
 the time of the Highland Clearances.  
 On a rocky eminence overlooking the   
 Kyle is Castle Varrich said to be of  
 the 12th cent but possibly of Viking  
 origin. At the western end of the     
 causeway near the cemetery is a Stone 
 Age midden, the remains of which show 
 how many oysters were eaten by our    
 ancestors. There are burial cists,    
 cairns, symbol stones and cup and ring
 stones at various placea around the   
 village and all of these sights are   
 visited by many tourists to the area. 
 An Archaeological Society has also    
 been started and they are working to  
 list all the sites .
