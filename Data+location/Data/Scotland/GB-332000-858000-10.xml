 in the villages of Fochabers and      
 Mosstodloch the social life of the    
 area is centred there.                
   There are three licensed houses in  
 Fochabers. Possibly the best known is{
 The{GORDON ARMS}Hotel which originated
 as a staging post in the days before  
 mechanised transport and when the     
 River Spey was crossed by ford to the 
 West of the village.                  
   The{GRANT ARMS}Hotel also provides  
 accomodation for visitors as well as  
 the usual social areas for the locals.
   The{RED LION}is the third hostelry  
 and also provides a 'childs bar' where
 the local youth can socialise in a    
 non-alcoholic environment.            
   With the development of Mosstodloch 
 as a residential area came the opening
 of the {BEN AIGAN}to provide a meeting
 place in the evening for locals.      </content>
