		<title>14SHOPPING IN BLANTYRE</title>
		<content> The main shopping centre in the area  
 is the{Clydeview Shopping Centre,     
 Glasgow Road, Blantyre. The centre was
 opened in 1981 on what had previously 
 been waste ground.                    
   At present the centre contains 1    
 superstore and a number of smaller    
 shops including - 6 food shops, 4     
 non-food shops and a number of        
 services e.g. optician, travel agent, 
 bank, building society, lawyers,      
 restaurant and post office.           
    However, recently several non-food 
 shops have closed down - 2 clothing, 1
 video and 1 motorist shops and a      
 public house. This highlights changing
 habits.                               
    The centre, and the {ASDA}         
 superstore in particular, dominate    
 shopping patterns in the area as our  
 survey showed.(see page 15)
