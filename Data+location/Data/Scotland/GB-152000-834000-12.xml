 NEARLY EVERY BOY ON RAASAY PLAYS      
 FOOTBALL.THERE ARE SOME SWINGS DOWN IN
 THE PARK.SOMETIMES WE PLAY SCEETCHI ON
 THE ROAD.SCEETCHI IS A GAME THAT YOU  
 PLAY WITH A SLATE,YOU THROW THE SLATE 
 AT A NUMBER ON THE SCEETCHI THEN YOU  
 HOP TO IT AND PICK IT UP THEN HOP     
 BACK.IF YOU HOP ON A LINE YOU ARE OUT.
 SOMETIMES I PLAY TENNIS AGAINST A     
 WALL.THERE ARE LOTS OF PLACES TO HIDE 
 ON RAASAY SO I SOMETIMES PLAY HIDE AND
 SEEK WITH SOME OTHER PEOPLE.I         
 SOMETIMES HAVE SWORD  FIGHTS BUT I DO 
 NOT HAVE ANY SWORDS,SO I USE STICKS.IF
 YOU HAVE A DARRO OR A FISHING ROD YOU 
 CAN GO FISHING AT THE PIER OR AT THE  
 HOME LOCH,OR IF YOU HAVE A BOAT YOU   
 CAN FISH OUT IN THE SEA.
