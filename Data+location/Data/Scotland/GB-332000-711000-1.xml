		<title>01Landscape of Springfield</title>
		<content> The village of{Springfield}lies on the
 South-West border of the parish of{   
{Cupar}. It is on the North bank of the
{River Eden}and lies within two miles  
 of Cupar. It also has a railway       
 station on the main Edinburgh/Aberdeen
 line.                                 
 It was once said that the whole of{   
{Stratheden}was a land-locked sheet of 
 water,it is from this that the name   
 Springfield is derived.The land in and
 around Springfield is very flat.There 
 are a lot of bits of uncultivated     
 land,but it's not going to waste      
 because the Forestery Commission have 
 planted a new generation of trees.    
 Just facing {Over Rankeilour}farm is a
 huge mansion called Rankeilour Estate.
 There is normally a lot of grassland  
 because of the cows.                  
                                       
                                       </content>
