		<title>08PRONY HILL FARM</title>
		<content> Hill sheep farming methods have not   
 become mechanised in the same way that
 lowland farms have in recent years.   
 Arable fields are small and steep and 
 the livestock are run on vast area of 
 rough ground. Most arable land is used
 to grow hay, silage and turrnips, to  
 keep the livestock during the cold,   
 snowy winter.                         
 The breeds of sheep most common on    
 Scottish hill farms are Cheviot and   
 Scottish Blackface, both hardy breeds.
 The main product of the hill farm     
 comes from the sale of lambs, often to
 Europe and the Arab countries.  The   
 wool from the adult sheep is also sold
 but now competition from man-made     
 fibres has reduced its importance.
