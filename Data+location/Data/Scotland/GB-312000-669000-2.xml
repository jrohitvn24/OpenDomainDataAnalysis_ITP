		<title>02RATHO VILLAGE</title>
		<content> BECAUSE THE VILLAGE LIES TO THE WEST  
 OF EDINBURGH, MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN   
 RATHO COMMUTE THERE TO WORK. IN A     
 SURVEY IT WAS FOUND THAT ABOUT 50% OF 
 THE WORKING PEOPLE TRAVEL TO EDINBURGH
 WHILE ABOUT 35% WORK IN SURROUNDING   
 TOWNS LIKE LIVINGSTON OR BATHGATE.    
 ONLY ABOUT 15% OF THE WORKING PEOPLE  
 HAVE JOBS IN, OR NEAR TO, THE VILLAGE.
    ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE     
 VILLAGE BEING IN A RURAL SETTING IS   
 THAT MANY FAMILIES HAVE MORE THAN ONE 
 CAR. OVER 35% OF THE FAMILIES HAVE    
 MORE THAN ONE VEHICLE IN THE FAMILY.  
    IN A SURVEY CARRIED OUT THIS YEAR  
 IT WAS FOUND THAT NEARLY 60% OF THE   
 PEOPLE IN RATHO HAD STAYED IN THE     
 VILLAGE FOR A PERIOD OF LESS THAN TEN 
 YEARS. THE MAIN INFLUX OF PEOPLE CAME 
 MAINLY FROM SURROUNDING VILLAGES AND  
 TOWNS LIKE EDINBURGH WITH  ABOUT 2%   
 COMING FROM PLACES FURTHER AFIELD.    </content>
