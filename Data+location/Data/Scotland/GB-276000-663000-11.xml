		<title>11AIRDRIE POLICE STATION</title>
		<content> THE POLICE STATION IN AIRDRIE WAS     
 OPENED IN 1959.THE HEAD MAN IS CHIEF  
 INSPECTOR LAIRD.COMPUTERS PLAY A LARGE
 PART IN POLICE WORK THERE.THE FIVE    
 CARS,ONE VAN AND TWO UNMARKED C.I.D.  
 CARS ARE HIGHLY MODERNISED WITH       
 COMPUTER-AIDED RADIOS HAVING A RANGE  
 OF 20 MILES.ALTHOUGH AIRDRIE HAS ITS  
 OWN POLICE FORCE IT IS STILL PART OF  
 THE LARGER STRATHCLYDE FORCE WHICH IS 
 THE{LARGEST IN EUROPE.                
{     }AIRDRIE'S MOST COMMON CRIMES ARE
 SHOPLIFTING AND CAR THEFT.DRUGS ARE   
 NOT A MAIN PROBLEM HERE.TWENTY YEARS  
 AGO BECAUSE THERE WERE NO LARGE STORES
 WITH OPEN DISPLAYS(A BLATANT          
 TEMPTATION) THERE WERE VERY FEW       
 SHOPLIFTING OFFENSES IN AIRDRIE.CRIMES
 IN THIS AREA IN GENERAL HAVE BECOME   
 BIGGER AND MORE VIOLENT BUT THERE HAS 
 BEEN NO USE OF FIRE ARMS.
