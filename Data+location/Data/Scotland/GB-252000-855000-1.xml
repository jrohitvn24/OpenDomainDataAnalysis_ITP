		<content> Our four by three kilometre rectangle 
 is situated in the Northern part of   
 Scotland, West of the Cromarty Firth. 
 The area we live in is mainly         
 agricultural land ,even though it Â£s  
 not a flat area.The remainder of the  
 land is mainly forests of coniferous  
 and deciduous trees.Our area contains 
 two communities,Maryburgh and Conon   
 Bridge.The nearest large city is      
 Inverness which is eleven miles to the
 South.During the summer months this   
 area is a popular tourist centre with 
 many attractions for the visitors such
 as Forest trails,Mountain walk,       
 Angling and easy access to much of    
 Scotland's finest scenery.There is    
 very little Industry within this area 
 apart from Agriculture and Foresty.The
 nearest shopping centre is Dingwall   
 which is one mile to the North.
