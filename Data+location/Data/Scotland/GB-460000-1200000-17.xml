		<title>17I love living in Uyeasound.</title>
		<content> I was born in Lerwick on Thursday 15th
 May 1975 but since then I have lived  
 in Uyeasound.                         
   I love living in Uyeasound because  
 the people I know are very nice. I    
 love all the birds in Uyeasound       
 because they are very beautiful. The  
 school that I go to is brilliant but  
 some of the of the teachers are       
 strict. In Uyeasound there is lots of 
 open space because there are hardly   
 any houses. I love it in Uyeasound    
 because in Summer the nights are      
 light and you can stay out late.      
   I would like Uyeasound to have a    
 roundabout in the playpark like the   
 one at Haroldswick. If I had to live  
 anywhere else I would choose          
 Baltasound.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
