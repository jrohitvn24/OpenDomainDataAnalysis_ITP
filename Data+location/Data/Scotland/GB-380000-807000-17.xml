		<title>17Cable T.V. in Westhill</title>
		<content>{Cable T.V.}came to Westhill on        
 4.5.1985. It is transmitted from      
 London but there is a local office in 
 Aberdeen. So far there are 11 cable   
 channels available plus BBC and ITV.  
 Cable T.V. is a type of Media and it  
 is a popular form of entertainment    
 around Europe. Many people are        
 receiving it in Westhill and most say 
 it is educational and entertaining    
 because there is a wide variety of    
 good programmes. When we interviewed  
 the public,women liked the{Premiere  }
 channel and men liked the{Sports   }  
 channel. The public are annoyed at    
 roads and gardens being dug up, but at
 Â£16.95 a month it is reasonably       
 priced.A gardener tidies the gardens  
 and council workers fill in the roads.
 The main company involved is British  
 Telecom,but another company,Kevin     
 Oliphant, supplies the equipment.     </content>
