		<title>05School Sports Day</title>
		<content> The School Sports Day is the main     
 event of the school year. Springholm's
 sporting grounds are excellent and big
 enough for not just Springholm to use 
 but Hardgate and Kirkgunzeon too. The 
 whole day is a family day out. There  
 are fun races for mums and pre-school 
 children. Altogether there are roughly
 150-170 people involved. For the more 
 athletic type there are sprints and   
 long distances. There are also novelty
 races for the non-athletic type       
 person. For example there is the      
 sackrace, egg and spoon race and      
 obstacle course. There are no main    
 prizes like cups or shields but prizes
 for individuals. Altogether this day  
 is thoroughly enjoyed by everyone. The
 sports were held on Tuesday 25th June 
 1985 at 1.30 pm.
