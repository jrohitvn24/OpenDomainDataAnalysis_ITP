		<title>01The Wauchope Valley</title>
		<content> Wauchope valley is a fertile stretch  
 of land with hills up to 343m.  The   
 hills are uncultivated except for     
 stretches of forest, but the land at  
 lower levels is fertile, and deciduous
 trees grow abundantly.                
    There are two farms in the area,   
 Tythe House and Wauchope Farm.  Sheep 
 are kept mainly on the rough          
 grassland, whilst cattle for beef are 
 bred on the lower slopes.  Barley,    
 corn, silage and hay are harvested    
 from the most fertile land.           
    Forests, planted by the Forestry   
 Commission, grow on the higher slopes 
 of the hills to the east and south of 
 the valley.  Many of the trees have   
 been felled recently, their timber    
 going to be made into supports for    
 mines, the building industry, etc.
