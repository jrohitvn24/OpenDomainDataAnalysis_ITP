		<content> The only place of worship in our block
 is {THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND PARISH     
{CHURCH OF HOBKIRK.}This is located    
 just outside the village of Bonchester
 Bridge,not far from the school.The    
 Manse,residence of the Minister,is    
 about 1Km.South-west of the church,   
 further up the Rulewater Valley.      
 The Glebe or church lands lie between 
 the Manse and the schoolhouse.They are
 currently rented from the church by   
 the owner of Hartshaugh Farm,situated 
 opposite.This church is linked with   
 the one at Southdean,services being   
 held every Sunday morning in alternate
 weeks.The present church was finished 
 in 1863,although there is known to    
 have been one on the site since 1045. 
 Four church elders assist with the    
 running of the church,and the Minister
 also attends the school regularly,as  
 school chaplain.                      </content>
