		<title>02ESKDALEMUIR IN THE 1980's</title>
		<content> What is it like to live in Eskdalemuir
 in the 1980's ?                       
  For the long established residents   
 who have their roots firmly in the    
 land it is home, the place of their   
 forefathers , changed now ,but still  
 meaningful.                           
   "I wouldn't want to change. I       
 couldn't live without the hills of    
 Eskdalemuir ",says one."I was born    
 here ,as was my father and grandfather
 . i shall hope to die here",says      
 another.                              
  For the city or surburban folk       
 retired to country cottages           
 ,Eskdalemuir is peace and quiet;time  
 to read ,to fish ,to enjoy nature, to 
 study archaeology , to become a valued
 part of  a local community, to have a 
 new identity.                         
                                       
                                       </content>
