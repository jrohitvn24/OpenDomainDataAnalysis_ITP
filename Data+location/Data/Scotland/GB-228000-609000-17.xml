		<content>{THE TOWN HALL}occupies the site of the
 town house of the Lairds of Blairquhan
 It originally extended across the main
 street onto part of the premises now  
 occupied by the Royal Bank and        
 Camerons Garage. This building is     
 believed to have been older than the {
{CASTLE.}At the end of the 17thC. it   
 became the town courthouse and gaol.  
 Most of the building was then removed.
 In 1887 the present town hall was     
 built retaining only parts of the     
 original tower.                       
{CROSSRAGUEL ABBEY}probably gaelic for 
 the abbey "of the holy cross built in 
 stone". It was founded by Duncan Earl 
 of Carrick in the 13thC. A dispute    
 occurred between the Clunaic mother   
 house of Paisley Abbey and the Earl   
 because lands and revenues allocated  
 were retained but only a small chapel 
 built.                                </content>
