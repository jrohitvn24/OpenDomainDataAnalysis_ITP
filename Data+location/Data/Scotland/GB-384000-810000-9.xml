		<content>   {Aberdeen Airport,}formerly known as
 Dyce Airport, has served the City of  
 Aberdeen since the 1930's. In those   
 early days of aviation it was a simple
 grass field. During World War II it   
 was upgraded to a Fighter Airfield by 
 the R.A.F. and today it is one of the 
 busiest Airports in the U.K. in       
 relation to the number of flights and 
 is the busiest heliport in the world. 
   For example in{1965/66}about{90,000}
 passengers used the airfield, by{1985}
 the figure was nearer{2 million.}     
   Aircraft movements during this      
 period had grown to a staggering      
 figure of about{9000 aircraft         
{movements a month.}
