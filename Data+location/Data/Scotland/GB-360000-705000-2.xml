 The Urban Landscape of Crail          
 Crail is a town of ancient stone-built
 houses with red pantile roofs,        
 crow-stepped gables and that          
 appearance of solid endurance which   
 characterises traditionally Scottish  
 architecture.  Its harbour is a       
 never-ending source of interest.  It  
 has an unspoiled coastline of rocks   
 and sandy beaches.  The land around   
 Crail has trees only round the farm   
 houses and the town, asit is mostly   
 agricultural.  The people in Crail    
 keep beautiful gardens, some of them  
 called 'Lang Riggs' because of their  
 length.  There are several historic   
 buildings like the Town House, the    
 Doocot and the Church, and many old   
 houses with outside stairs can be     
 found on the way down the steep       
 streets leading to the harbour.       </content>
