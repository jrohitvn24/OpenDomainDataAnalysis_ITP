		<title>17SKERRIES WILDLIFE</title>
		<content> There is a very limited variety of    
 animals on Skerries:{rats, rabbits,   
 seals and very rarely{otters.}The     
 seals are mostly{common seals}but     
 there are some{grey seals}which are   
 slightly larger and have more pointed 
 noses. There is however a good        
 selection of birds and most of them   
 have Shetland names. The most common  
 birds during the summer are{tirricks  
 (Arctic Terns),{maalies}(Fulmars),    
{shalders}(Oystercachers),{tammie      
{nories}(Puffins) and{scories}(Common  
 gulls). The most vicious birds are    
{bonxies}(Great Skuas) and{black backed
{gulls.}In the summer,birdwatchers come
 to Skerries to see the many small     
 migrants. There is an ornithologist on
 the island. The birds which he rings  
 have been found in as diverse places  
 as North Africa and Sweden.
