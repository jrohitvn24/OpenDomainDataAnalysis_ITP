		<content> From 1950-1970 the Stewart family     
 farmed Pitbladdo as a dairy farm.     
 However, in 1970, when the first of   
 their two sons was ready to leave     
 school and come into the family       
 business, they decided to expand. They
 rented additional land and changed    
 over to arable farming.               
  They now own 850 acres and employ two
 farmworkers in addition to the two    
 sons already working on the farm. The 
 employees live rent free in new       
 houses, built on the estate. The other
 tied cottages on the land have been   
 modernised and either sold or rented. 
  Mrs.Stewart now spends most of her   
 time on paperwork associated with     
 unning the farm. This has increased   
 dramatically over the years,          
 especially since the introduction of  
 V.A.T. which, as agriculture is zero  
 rated, farmers have to claim back.    </content>
