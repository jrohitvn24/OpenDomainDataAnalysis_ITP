		<title>08Housing in Shiskine</title>
		<content> The number of houses in the Shiskine  
 valley has increased rapidly in the   
 last twenty years. This means there   
 has been an increase in population.   
                                       
{Most houses are owner-occupied.}There 
 are a few rented council houses left -
 most of the others were sold to the   
 tenants in the 1980's.                
                                       
 Quite a number of the bungalows in    
 Shiskine are owned by people who live 
 on the mainland: these houses are only
 used during holiday months. The{modern
{houses are mostly frame built houses  
{with roughcast finish and tiled roofs.
{}                                     
 The{older houses are built of stone   
{with slate roofs.}Most of these were  
 built around the beginning of this    
 century and are similar in appearance.
