		<content> The 13th century Cathedral and old    
 town lie on the east bank of the Allan
 Water in a narrow glen where the main 
 south-north road and railway cross the
 river.  New houses lie on hills to    
 east and west, the western section    
 separated from the town centre by the 
 busy A9.  A promised by-pass is       
 eagerly awaited.  The panorama of     
 mountains to west and north is        
 dramatic.  The country is rolling,    
 wooded and intensively farmed.  Using 
 excellent rail and road communications
 many inhabitants are commuters,       
 working all over central Scotland;    
 this is a mobile population with young
 families, many English.  Tradesmen,   
 shopkeepers, professional and retired 
 people are the stable element.  The   
 historic town, close to the Perthshire
 Highlands attracts the tourists.
