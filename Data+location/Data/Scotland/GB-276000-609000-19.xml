		<content> One of the most important events in   
 our past was the signing of the       
 "Sanquhar Declaration". For 40 years  
 the Covenanters had been fighting     
 against the Stuart kings' attempts to 
 unify religious practices and to      
 introduce English Prayerbooks into    
 Scottish churches, when on 22nd June  
 1680 a leading Covenanter, Richard    
 Cameron, and 20 armed men rode into   
 Sanquhar. At the town centre, Cameron 
 nailed onto the market cross a        
 declaration of war on King Charles II,
 naming him a tyrant and an enemy of   
 Christ. This was seen as an act of    
 treason and a reward of 5000 merks was
 offered for Cameron's arrest. He was  
 soon captured and executed by dragoons
 30 miles NW of Sanquhar. A monument   
 marks the place where he fell and a   
 street in Sanquhar bears his name, as 
 does a famous Scottish regiment.      </content>
