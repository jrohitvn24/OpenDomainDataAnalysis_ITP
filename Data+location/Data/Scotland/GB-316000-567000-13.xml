    In the council estate behind our   
 school, most of the streets are named 
 after local place-names, but there are
 two streets with interesting names.   
    They are called{Clapperton Road}and
{Caledonian Crescent.}Sir Hugh         
 Clapperton was a famous explorer in   
 Africa.                               
    The name Caledonian refers to the  
 name of the railway company, who      
 operated a line between{Lockerbie}and{
{Annan.}The line has not been used for 
 many years and the railway cutting    
 near the school is now used as a waste
 pipeline from the nearby{Chapelcross  
{Nuclear Power Station}to the Solway   
 Firth.
