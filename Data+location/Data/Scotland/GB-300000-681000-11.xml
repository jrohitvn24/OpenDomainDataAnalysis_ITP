		<title>11BO'NESS THE CUBS</title>
		<content> I am in the cubs and I like them. We  
 always meet on a Monday at 6.45 pm.   
 Our leaders are Baloo,Akela and       
 Bagera. They all respond to the Jungle
 Book. Baloo is the bear,Akela is the  
 wolf and Bagera is the panther. We    
 have about 36 cubs altogether. Our    
 number is the 3rd Bo'ness,but we are  
 the only cubs in Bo'ness. We play     
 games. When all the cubs form a circle
 we are given a letter. A beanbag is   
 put in the middle of the circle and   
 Akela shouts a letter. Everybody with 
 that letter runs round the circle once
 and then turns in to grab the beanbag.
 I like being in the cubs because I    
 like learning things that would help  
 me. We are trained in tracking things 
 as well. Cubs are great.
