		<title>14EAST LINTON GALA WEEK</title>
		<content>   For about 40 years the village has  
 had a Gala Week, usually in June. On  
 the first day the Gala Queen, a       
 primary 7 girl, with her attendants,  
 is driven through the village on a    
 decorated lorry. The parade, led by a 
 pipe band, also includes lorries      
 decorated by local groups and clubs,  
 and children in fancy dress.          
   Many people come to watch the       
 crowning ceremony in the park. There  
 are also contests for Knobbly Knees   
 and Bonnie Babies, stalls with games, 
 Scottish Dancing and children's races.
   To remind the Gala Queen of her     
 special day, she helps to plant a tree
 in the garden of her home.            
   During Gala Week there are football 
 and netball competitions, treasure    
 hunts,art displays, a disco for       
 children and an adults' dance. Gala   
 Week is fun for everyone.             </content>
