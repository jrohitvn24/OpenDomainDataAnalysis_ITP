		<title>12Keeping fit in Linwood</title>
		<content> In 1983,Linwood became the only place 
 in Britain to have daily P.E for the  
 Primary 6&amp;7 children in Linwood       
 Primary Schools.We have carried out a 
 survey to find what the P.E teachers, 
 the Primary School teachers and the   
 children involved think about this    
 project.One P.E teacher thought that  
 daily P.E. was a good idea because it 
 makes the pupils fitter,they learn new
 activities and get to know the High   
 School teachers.All the children      
 asked,liked daily P.E.They thought it 
 made them fitter and helped with sport
 and other work.Some children thought  
 it was a test.Over the past year we   
 have played unihoc,benchball,tennis   
 and learned to orienteer.We have also 
 done gymnastics,swimming and dancing. 
 Most of the children enjoyed taking   
 part.
