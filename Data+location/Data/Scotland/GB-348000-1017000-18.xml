		<title>18HURRICANE 1952</title>
		<content> Windy weather in{Orkney}is quite      
 common. What happened in{January 1952 
 was very unusual.In the early hours of
 the morning a very strong gale finally
 reaching{hurricane}force blew up.It   
 was a westerly wind from the Atlantic.
 Before reaching Orkney it had swept   
 across Caithness,strengthening as it  
 went.                                 
 Some dinghies,not secure in their     
 winter noust disappeared.Henhouses    
 with dazed or dead hens were blown    
 out to sea.Some hens had all their    
 feathers plucked by the wind .Another 
 crashed through a farmhouse window at 
 a terrific rate,landing in a box-bed. 
 The occupants were astonished.        
    In the fields haystacks were flying
 about.Pieces of felt from henhouse    
 roofs were stuck about 3 inches into  
 neeps (turnips).There was{no loss of  
{life}because everybody was in bed.    </content>
