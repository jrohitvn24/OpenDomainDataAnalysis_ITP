		<title>07ARNPRIOR PETROL STATION</title>
		<content> At the western end of Arnprior village
 there is a small petrol station       
 /smiddy. It has 3 pumps and each month
 sells approximately 16500 litres of 4 
 star petrol, 3500 litres of 2 star    
 petrol and 2000 litres of diesel fuel 
 - mostly to local people, but some to 
 passing travellers.                   
 The station is run by one man and his 
 son. Apart from selling petrol they   
 also do blacksmith work. They mend    
 tractors, ploughs, combines and many  
 other types of farm machinery and     
 specialise in welding and forging.    
 They also repair rakes, forks, shovels
 and all kinds of hand tools commonly  
 used on the farms. They keep a small  
 stock of new tools, fencing materials 
 and so on to sell to the farmers.     
 Until recently horses were shod at the
 smiddy, and the old coal forge has    
 been replaced by a portable gas forge.</content>
