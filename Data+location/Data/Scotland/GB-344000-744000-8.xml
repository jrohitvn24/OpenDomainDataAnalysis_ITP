     Inverarity is situated at a       
 junction of minor roads leading to the
 east,west and south of the village.It 
 is approximately 1km east of          
 the A929 Forfar to Dundee road.Around 
 Inverarity there is a network of minor
 country roads leeding to Carrot Hill  
 and east to Whigstreet and other small
 communities.Most of the minor roads in
 the area are not of particularly good 
 quality as many of them have dips or  
 holes in them.The A929 at the moment  
 is being improved and updated by being
 formed into a dual carriageway.This is
 to help the road cope with the load of
 traffic travelling on it to Dundee and
 towards the Tay Road Bridge and       
 also the traffic travelling north to  
 Aberdeen.
