		<title>06Annan By-Pass</title>
		<content>    One of the big topics just now is  
 about the by _pass project to the     
 north of Annan. There has been lots of
 crashes on the road and a baby was    
 killed at Eastriggs this week.The     
 by_pass will be part of the A75       
 Euroroute from Gretna to Stranraer. It
 will stretch from Gretna beyond Annan 
 and will miss out the villages of the 
 Rigg and Eastriggs as well as the town
 of Annan.                             
    The new by-pass will go very close 
 to our school and it will be possible 
 to see the traffic from our upstairs  
 classrooms. Two roads near the school 
 will have to be blocked off and this  
 will make it more difficult for people
 who are employed at Chapelcross to get
 to their work.
