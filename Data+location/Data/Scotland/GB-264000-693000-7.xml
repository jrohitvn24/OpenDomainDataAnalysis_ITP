 There are about 200 members at present
 and this summer a number of successful
 competitions were held. The idea of a 
 tennis club for Kippen started in     
 October 1982 and,after the forming of 
 a small committee,the successful      
 application for grants,and much       
 fund-raising,the excavations began.The
 courts were ready for play just when  
 Wimbledon fever gripped Kippen and are
 still very busy.
