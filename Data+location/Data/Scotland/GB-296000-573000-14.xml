		<title>14Roads in Dumfries</title>
		<content> 64% of families in our region own a   
 car. This is the highest percentage in
 our country. The roads form the main  
 link in the area because we have no   
 rail network and it is becoming a     
 hair-raising situation. Since Dumfries
 is the largest town in our Region,    
 people pour in to work in offices,    
 schools, shops, hospitals etc. This   
 can cause delays and frustration. This
 situation happens in reverse in the   
 evenings. Holiday times are worse,    
 with cars, caravans and coaches making
 their way to or from the Solway Coast.
 The fact that huge juggernauts coming 
 from and going back to Ireland also   
 pass through Dumfries which has only  
 two traffic bridges and very narrow   
 streets results in massive traffic    
 jams, damage to roads and bridges and 
 general chaos. I hope our promised    
 by-pass arrives before I am driving.  </content>
