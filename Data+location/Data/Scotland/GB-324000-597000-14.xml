		<content>  Eskdalemuir Womens Rural Institute   
 still meets every month from September
 to April,though numbers have sadly    
 declined due to afforestation and the 
 establishment of a Buddhist           
 non-participating community.          
  Thus it is now a struggle to keep the
 "rural" going, as it is difficult and 
 indeed embarassing to ask speakers or 
 demonstrators to come so far , perhaps
 in inclement weather to talk to so few
 members. We try to swell our numbers  
 by inviting ladies from neighbouring  
 parishes to join us.We have many happy
 nights enjoying the company and       
 exchange of ideas.Subjects range from 
 cookery,crochet,flower arranging,     
 basket work,weavings.Sometimes a      
 keep-fit night a travel talk with     
 slides .Visits are arranged to the    
 Pantomime and Operatic Society        
 productions in nearby towns.          </content>
