		<content> When the newly built Parish Church in 
 Keig was opened for worship on 11     
 October, 1835 the close and long      
 liaison between Minister, Schoolmaster
 and Laird gave continuity and accepted
 leadership with the welfare of the    
 poor being the natural concern of     
 leaders and parishioners alike.       
 Times have changed. Since the early   
 1900s there have been 10 ministries in
 Keig. A linkage in 1977 was formed    
 between Alford, Tullynessle/Forbes and
 Keig under the Rev. J.S.A. Smith,     
 succeeded by the Rev. Dr. Joyce Collie
 in 1980, each church retaining its    
 individual Courts, Woman's Guilds and 
 Sunday Schools.                       
 The Minister's residence is at East   
 Manse, Alford, the accrued revenue    
 from the sale of Keig Manse funding   
 the upkeep of the fabric of Keig      
 Church, Church Hall and Alford Manse. </content>
