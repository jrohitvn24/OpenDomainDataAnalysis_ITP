		<content>      THE BEST PLACE AROUND HERE FOR   
 BIRDS AND THEIR NESTS IS AT THE       
 PLANTAIN UP IN RATHVEN.               
      THERE ARE BLUE TITS, YELLOW      
 HAMMERS AND COAL TITS.  THERE IS ONE  
 SPARROW HAWK'S NEST UP THE PLANTAIN   
 AND ABOVE IT IN THE TREES THERE IS A  
 RAVEN'S NEST WITH THREE CHICKS.  THEY 
 ARE JUST ABOUT READY TO FLY.  I LIKE  
 TO WATCH THE MOTHER BIRD FEEDING HER  
 CHICKS.  I KNOW WHERE THERE ARE TWO   
 WRENS' NESTS.  THERE IS ONE NEST WITH 
 THREE EGGS AND ONE WITH TWO EGGS.     
 YESTERDAY, I SAW THAT ALL THE EGGS HAD
 HATCHED.  THE NESTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT
 TO FIND AND THE ONLY WAY THAT I SAW   
 THEM WAS TO FOLLOW THE BIRDS TO THE   
 SIDE OF THE BURN.                     
      WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR GOLF BALLS
 I FOUND A YELLOW HAMMER'S NEST WITH   
 FOUR YOUNG DUG INTO THE BANK
