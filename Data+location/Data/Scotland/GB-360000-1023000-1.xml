		<content> Rothiesholm is practically all        
 farmland grass and barley is mostly   
 grown.   In one of the fields there is
 a burial chamber which has never been 
 excavated.   On the south side there  
 is a sandy bay.   Beside it there is a
 links (sandy ground) in which there is
 a sand quarry.   A house called Mount 
 Pleasant which lies next to the links.
 the house used to be called St.       
 Salvador.   Behind it there is a      
 sunken garden which is man made.      
 Next to it there are many humps in the
 ground which are thought to be small  
 houses but are probably   mounds of   
 earth dug from the sunken garden.
