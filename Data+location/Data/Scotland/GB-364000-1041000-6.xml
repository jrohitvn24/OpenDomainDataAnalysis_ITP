		<title>06THE SANDAY SHIPPING MASTER</title>
		<content> Mr.Wilson likes the job of being      
 shipping master on Sanday. His job    
 involves{recording the times boats    
{arrive &amp; depart,}&amp;{checking the goods 
 which come off &amp; are put on. He helps 
 put the{gang plank}in place &amp; tells   
 people when their packages have       
 arrived.{4 passenger boats}come       
 regularly to Sanday. The{"Orcadia"}&amp;  
 the{"Islander"}carry{goods}to Sanday  
 &amp; Sanday folk send back cattle, sheep,
 food, clothing (by the Sanday         
 knitters), etc. The{"Golden Mariana"  
 mainly carries{passengers}&amp; she can be
{chartered}for football trips, etc.    
 The{"Guide"}has just started a        
{12-passenger service}to Sanday.       
 In the near future the{"Orcadia"}&amp; the
{"Islander"}might be replaced by{"Storm
{Masters"}which are smaller vessels    
 with a{"Ro-Ro"}capacity. It is unsure 
 whether they will be a success.       </content>
