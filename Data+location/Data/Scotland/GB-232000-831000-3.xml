		<content> The Scottish Women's Rural Institute  
{(SWRI)}hold regular meetings and cover
 a wide area of interests particularly 
 in the field of{arts and crafts. }The 
 WRI ladies are very talented and hold 
 regular and varied competitions and   
 meetings. Open nights are also held to
 which anyone in the area is invited.  
 There is a{Country Dancing}Club which 
 often holds rallies and has exchange  
 visits with clubs from neighbouring   
 areas. There is also a{Youth Club     
 which meets weekly in the local hall. 
 All clubs regularly hold jumble sales,
 sales of work, whist drives, discos   
 and ceilidhs (concerts with singing   
 and dancing interspersed) to          
 supplement club funds and to help     
 local charities. Burns Suppers,       
 Hallowe'en parties, Xmas parties and  
 Senior Citizens parties are also held 
 by the various{clubs.                 </content>
