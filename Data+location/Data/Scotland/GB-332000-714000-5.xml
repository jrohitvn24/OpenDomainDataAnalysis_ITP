		<content>  We are fortunate that our area is    
 attractive farmland but there is an   
 awareness that farm chemicals can     
 create problems.Every farm in our area
 has its own well water supply.Each is 
 about 5 to 10 metres deep and can be  
 relied on throughout the              
 year.However,there is some concern    
 that the well water now contains a    
 high level of nitrates,the result of  
 run-off from nitrogen fertilisers     
 which are applied to farm crops,      
 especially cereals. In addition       
 chemical run off from pesticide sprays
 and sheep dip water can find its way  
 into this underground water and create
 problems. The local Agricultural      
 College stresses the need for great   
 care when spraying crops. The River   
 Tay Purification Board carefully      
 monitors the water quality in the     
 Ladyburn,our only important stream.   </content>
