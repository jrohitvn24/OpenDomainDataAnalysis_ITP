		<title>09THE VIEW FROM MY WINDOW</title>
		<content> When I wake up in the morning I       
 look out at the beautiful view of     
 trees,one house,sheep,walks and part  
 of a farm. The types of trees that I  
 can see  are pines,douglas firs and   
 some oak.I think that the trees in the
 Autunm look better than any other     
 season. It is lovely to see the leaves
 changing from green to                
 yellow,red,orange and gold.           
                                       
   I can see a croft which belongs to  
 Mr and Mrs Bergant.They have a few    
 sheep on the land.The sheep do not    
 stay the same all the year round.They 
 change from white to a light brown in 
 the winter.                           
   If I look from the edge of my window
 I can see the farm house up the road. 
 It has rough cast on the outside then 
 there is brick.There are ponies,ducks,
 hens and one cow used for milk.       </content>
