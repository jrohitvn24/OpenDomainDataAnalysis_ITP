		<content>    Founded in 1820 this family        
 business has become established as one
 of the major producers of trees in    
 Scotland.                             
    In 1984 over 14 million trees,     
 mainly Sitka spruce,Scots pine and    
 Larch were sold. The acreage needed   
 for this size of harvest has meant    
 expansion outside the original site to
 land at Ordiquish and Tulloch,a few   
 miles out of Fochabers.               
    The original nursery specialises as
 a garden centre providing a supply of 
 plants,trees and shrubs for the many  
 gardeners in the surrounding area.    
    The present firm is run by Mr      
 George Christie and his family,       
 employing about 50 people most of who 
 reside in the village.
