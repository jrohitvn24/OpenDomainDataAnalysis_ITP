		<title>13GOSFORD ESTATE</title>
		<content> This is the large estate of the Earls 
 of Wemyss at the west side of the     
 village, enclosed within a great wall.
 It is by no means as ancient as       
 Luffness; nevertheless there was an   
 early 17th century fortified house on 
 it, near the present great mansion,   
 until demolished  in this mid-20th    
 century.                              
 The mansion of Gosford House is       
 something of a fine show-place, with a
 handsome marble staircase, galleries  
 and fine appartments.(Part of the     
 House is in disrepair and is open to  
 the elements).                        
 The wooded grounds are notable for the
 many ponds, haunt of wildfowl, created
 by the draining of the former         
 marshland at the head of Gosford Bay.
