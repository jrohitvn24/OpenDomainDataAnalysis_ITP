         {WAYNE HAYWARD                
 On Saturday June 1st it was my        
 sister's birthday.We got up and gave  
 her some presents.We then got dressed 
 and went to eat some breakfast.       
     At quarter past nine we went to   
 Anne's house to help put the raft onto
 a truck,and then we went to find a    
 good place to put it on the river     
 bank(river Ythan).                    
     Anne and the rest of the crew went
 across the bridge to the toilets to   
 get their costumes on.We had lunch on 
 the raft finishing just in time for   
 the race to begin.We started when a   
 man came round and blew his hooter.   
     Then we started to walk down the  
 river bank.On the way we helped twice 
 by pulling the raft.We came in 7th    
 last,we won 2 prizes for the funniest 
 and most creative raft.               </content>
