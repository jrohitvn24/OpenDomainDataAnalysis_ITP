		<content>{Question}What do you do when the sheep
 get covered in snow?                  
{Answer}If the sheep get covered in    
 snow I just have to look for them and 
 find as many as I can.If the sheep get
 enough room to move about they can    
 stay alive a long time.They look for  
 shelter themselves.That sort of thing 
 doesn't happen very often.There was a 
 bad winter in the early sixties and   
 then last year,but it's only every 15 
 to 20 years that it's a problem.      
{Question}How many sheep die?          
{Answer}About 150 every year.Usually   
 it's ticks that kills them or hoodie  
 crows and foxes at lambing time. I    
 shoot them if I see them.             
{Question}How much does a sheep cost?  
{Answer}A ram is about Â£100 a sheep is 
 about Â£70 and a lamb is worth about   
 Â£20.
