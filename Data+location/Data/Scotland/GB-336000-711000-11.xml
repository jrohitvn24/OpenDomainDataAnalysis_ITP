		<title>11SCOTSTARVIT TOWER</title>
		<content>  There was a house in the shape of a  
 tower on the site in{1475.Sir John    
{bought the Barony of Tarvit with the  
{tower in 1611.}It is built of grey    
 stone with a slate roof and{crow      
{stepped gables.}It is about 150 feet  
 high and is built horizontally with a 
 stair instead of a corridor connecting
 the rooms.It was last occupied in     
 1900.{The tower is one of the most    
{complete examples of its kind in      
{Scotland.}A P6 class went up the      
 tower. They said that climbing the    
 stairs was hard but the view from the 
 top was breathtaking. There has been a
 great interest in the tower because   
{this year is the 400th anniversary of 
{the birth of Sir John Scot.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
