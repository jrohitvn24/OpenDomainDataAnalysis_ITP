		<content> Apart from holiday cottages, one the  
 main tourist facilities in this area{ 
 is the{Caravan Club's}site at         
 Ballikinrain.                         
                                       
 This site, which is for club members  
 only and provides minimal facilities, 
 within a former enclosed garden, is   
 sadly due for closure at the end of   
 the current season.                   
                                       
 The reasons are clearly financial and 
 are the inevitability of the times in 
 which we live. It does seem a pity    
 that in a time of increasing leisure, 
 a facility enjoyed by many dedicated  
 caravaners is to be discontinued.     
                                       
 The Endrick, as elsewhere in Fintry,  
 provides good fishing. This is either 
 organised by local landowners or by   
 the{Loch Lomond Angling Association.  </content>
