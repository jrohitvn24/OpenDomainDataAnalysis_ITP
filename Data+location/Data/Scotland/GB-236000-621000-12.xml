		<content>{ The West of Scotland Agricultural    
{College at Auchincruive}is involved in
 programmes of research and development
 which are funded by the{Department of 
{Agriculture and Fisheries,Scotland.}In
 these programmes much attention is    
 paid to dealing with the problems and 
 needs of the College Region. The main 
 areas covered are milk, beef and sheep
 production, treatment and use of farm 
 waste and grass production. However,  
 much of the research which goes into  
 the areas of milk production and the  
 use of grass is done at{the college   
{dairy farm at Dumfries.}Hill farming  
 methods are carried out at{the two    
{hill farms, belonging to the College  
{at Crianlarich.    }                  
  The research and development work    
 carried out at Auchincruive helps to  
 provide farmers with advice on any    
 problems which they may be facing.    </content>
