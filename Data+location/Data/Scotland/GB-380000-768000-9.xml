		<title>09Gourdon's Harbour Mistress</title>
		<content> For almost 2 years Mrs. Marion (Penny)
 Gove has been{harbour mistress        
 although she came to Gourdon 15 years 
 ago. She first became harbour mistress
 when she applied to the Council when  
 the job was advertised and no         
 fishermen were interested. As harbour 
 mistress she has a variety of jobs to 
 do such as keeping the books, going to
 the bank and knowing how the hydraulic
 gates work. She likes the job even    
 more as time goes on because she likes
 working out of doors. There is a      
{superstition}that a woman is bad luck 
 on the pier when the boats go out to  
 sea so Mrs. Gove tries to hide on such
 occasions. She works on a Sunday      
 because yachts come in anytime in the 
 Summer. She is waiting for a fisherman
 to retire who will want the job and   
 then she is quite prepared to give up.
