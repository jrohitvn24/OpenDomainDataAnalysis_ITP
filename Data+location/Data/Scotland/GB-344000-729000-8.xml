		<title>08BROUGHTY FERRY - HOUSING</title>
		<content> Broughty Ferry contains a large       
 variety of different types of housing.
 House types include flats, villas,    
 bungalows, mansions and individually  
 designed houses. Although private     
 housing predominates there are several
 council house developments.           
  Many older large houses were         
 originally owned by Dundee Jute       
 Barons. They were built on vantage    
 sites and are clearly visible from the
 sea front.Many of these have now been 
 converted into flats.                 
   This area caters for the elderly and
 infirm by providing sheltered houses  
 in congenial settings. The residents  
 in this type of accommodation are     
 caringly and sympathetically looked   
 after.
