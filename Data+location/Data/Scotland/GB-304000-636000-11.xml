		<content> Biggar is part of {Clydesdale         
{District},which in its turn is part of
{Strathclyde Region}.At a purely local 
 level Biggar's interests are looked   
 after by is local councillor Esme     
 Hamilton,who is an Independant. Local 
 matters are also discussed by Biggar{ 
{Community Council.} However the {     
{Community Council }is currently facing
 a crisis due to lack of funds. The    
 Community has an integrated bus and   
 rail link to Glasgow provided by      
 Strathclyde Region. Central Government
 through the G.P.O provide a Post Bus  
 service to some of the neighbouring   
 villages.Apart from Transport the     
 Region plays a major part in deciding 
 Educational Policy and this became a  
 major local issue over wether pupils  
 should be bussed to other schools for 
 some subjects.
