		<title>09Foxhunting in West Lothian</title>
		<content> The Linlithgow and Stirlingshire Hunt 
 meets twice a year in Torphichen, in  
 December and March. Thre are between  
 seventy and eighty members altogether 
 and about thirty five are young       
 people. Lots of people follow the hunt
 and there are sometimes protesters but
 there has not been too much trouble   
 from saboteurs. West Lothian District 
 Council has recently brought out a    
 new ruling that the hunt can not ride 
 across their land after the fox.      
 This causes problems for the hunt     
 because the hounds have on several    
 occasions entered the council's       
 land and the hunt had dificulties in  
 retreiving the hounds.                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
