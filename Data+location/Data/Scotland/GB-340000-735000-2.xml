		<content> The{TEALING}district lies on the south
 facing slopes of the{SIDLAW HILLS.}The
{GEOLOGY}consists of Old Red Sandstone 
 with some minor igneous intrusions.   
 The whole area has a covering of      
 glacial sands and gravels which varies
 in thickness and composition. The area
 is drained by the{FITHIE BURN}and     
 there is evidence that its valley has 
 has been over deepened by the passage 
 of post-glacial meltwater in the S.E. 
 corner of the block. The{CLIMATE}is   
 generally mild and sunny since it is  
 sheltered from Northerly winds by the 
 Sidlaws. However, relief creates a    
 local frost and fog hollow in winter. 
 The annual precipitation is 800 mm.   
 but varies with altitude.             
{SOILS}derived from the ORS give light 
 loams but the composition varies and  
 can be stony in places where the      
 glacial drift is coarse.              </content>
