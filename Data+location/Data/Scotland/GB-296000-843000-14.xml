		<title>14WOODCUTTING IN FERNESS</title>
		<content>   Trees are cut down from between the 
 ages of twenty to one hundred years   
 old. different types of trees mature  
 at different rates.                   
   The woodcutter identifies the trees 
 to be felled by the paint spray marks 
 which have been placed by the         
 forester.                             
   A chain saw is used to cut down the 
 trees, and the wood is taken out of   
 the forest by means of a tractor and  
 winch. It is then loaded on to lorries
 by a mechanical grab and transported  
 to a sawmill.                         
   Once the wood is cut in the sawmill,
 it can then be used for building      
 materials, fencing or in numerous     
 other ways.                           
   Trees felled are very quickly       
 replaced by new young ones in order   
 that there will always be a steady    
 supply in the future.                 </content>
