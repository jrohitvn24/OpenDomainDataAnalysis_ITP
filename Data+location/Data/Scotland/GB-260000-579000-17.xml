		<content>    Most of the inhabitants adhere,    
 nominally at least, to the Church of  
 Scotland, though regular attenders are
 as elsewhere, in a minority. There is,
 however, always a good turnout for    
 weddings and funerals.                
      There is now only one functioning
 church in the village, a handsome     
 early nineteenth century building     
 overlooking the river. Another church,
 formerly United Free, ceased to       
 function when the two were amalgamated
 in 1949 and is now in private         
 ownership and semi-ruinous.           
    The small number of Episcopalians  
 attend St. Margaret's Scottish        
 Episcopal church in New Galloway which
 caters for them and for members of the
 Church of England who have retired in 
 the area.There is an even smaller     
 number of Roman Catholics, who travel 
 to Castle Douglas,for their services. </content>
