		<content>  At the top of the Lochans starting   
 around{Millview Terrace}there is a    
 council housing scheme. This area     
 comprises mainly of semi-detatched    
 housing. The houses are brick and 2   
 storey approximately past{1940.       
  However, even although the houses are
 in reasonably good condition there has
 only been one bought. At the top of{  
{Thorn Street}the houses turn into     
 terrace houses each having its own    
 garden. This is an area of old age    
 pensioners houses. At the top of{Cairn
{Terrace}which are semi-detached and   
 only one storey. As you head down the 
 street the housing changes from       
 council to private one or two storey  
 terraced houses. Many of these house  
 date{pre 1900}and are built of stone  
 as well as brick. These houses are in 
 good condition for their age and the  
 oldest was dated{1890.}               </content>
