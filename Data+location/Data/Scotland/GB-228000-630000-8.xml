		<content> During the month of JUNE 1985 P7 made 
 a visit to AILSA SHIPYARD.The class   
 were met by the manager and his       
 assistant.Everyone was given an orange
 safety helmet which we put on our     
 heads to hoots of laughter from all   
 around. We all felt very important.We 
 were split into two groups and set off
 for our first real look at industry.We
 saw huge cranes                       
 welders,engineers,designers and       
 platers employed in creating ships to 
 carry the name of TROON throughout the
 world.Fiona Cameron,expressed the     
 desire to become an engineer in the   
 future and was most surprised to learn
 that in 1985 female engineers were not
 as yet employed at AILSA.The class    
 enjoyed their visit and were invited  
 back to see the launch of the ship    
 under construction.A great day out.
