		<title>03DURNESS PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Durness Primary School was rebuilt in 
 1911.In 1957 electric lighting was    
 installed,followed by central heating 
 in 1958. Before this the school was   
 heated by peats which the children    
 brought in.In 1959 the school was     
 extended to provide two extra         
 classrooms and toilets which were used
 for junior secondary education.Today  
 there is only a Primary department    
 with two full time teachers.There are 
 various visiting teachers,gym,art,    
 chanter and the minister.The school is
 very well equipped and well           
 maintained.It is surrounded by a large
 playground and close by is a big      
 playing field with play equipment.When
 we have to go to secondary school we  
 travel to Dornoch or Golspie each week
 and get home on a Friday and go back  
 on Sunday night.In Dornoch and Golspie
 the teenagers stay in hostels.        </content>
