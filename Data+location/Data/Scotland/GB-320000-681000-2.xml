 Oxcars is a small, rocky, uninhabited 
 island in the Firth of Forth. It      
 belongs to Fife Region and is in the  
 parish of Aberdour.                   
                                       
  There is a 5 fathom bank round Oxcars
 reaching west to a point north of     
 Cramond. There is also a sand_bank    
 extending to the east to a point      
 midway north of Granton and Newhaven. 
 There is a lighthouse on the island   
 whose light is visible 12 miles away. 
                                       
  The "Ox" of the name is derived from 
 the word "auk" (the sea_bird) and the 
 "cars" is derived from "corraig"      
 (Gaelic or Irish) or "carreg" (Welsh) 
 meaning "sea_cliff" or "rock in the   
 sea".
