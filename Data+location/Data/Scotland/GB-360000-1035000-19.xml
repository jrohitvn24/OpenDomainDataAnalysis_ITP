  Because of the great amount of open  
 land in this area many people take    
 their horses or ponies for exercise   
 here.                                 
  Sarah Wenham owns a 15.2 hands Bay   
 gelding called "Max",and a light Bay  
 Shetland/New Forest pony called       
 "Brandy"; she often rides in this     
 area.                                 
  A favourite route of hers is over the
 Gump of Spurness, or following the    
 track from Stove out to Carlin        
 Foot. Because the ground is soft in   
 this area it makes cantering          
 safer. Due to the fact that the land  
 is quite poor and mostly uncultivated 
 here the owners have no objections to 
 people going over it.
