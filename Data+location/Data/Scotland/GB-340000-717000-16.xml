		<title>16THE RIVER EDEN AND ITS FISH</title>
		<content> The River Eden is a clean river so    
 that if you are thirsty you could stop
 for a drink. The Eden is also good for
 fishing. Some other rivers I have seen
 have few fish in them. The fish I     
 caught on Sunday was only about twenty
 mm long. That was a rainbow trout. The
 minnow was forty six mm long.         
 On Sunday 26th May 1985 I went down to
 the Eden. The water had risen since   
 the last time I was there.I was on the
 other side and it was warm enough to  
 paddle in.When the Eden leaves our    
 area it has about five miles to go    
 until it reaches the sea.
