		<title>16WELCOME HOME FUND: SHAWHEAD</title>
		<content>   Mr Learmont is one of the oldest    
 people in the village and one of his  
 memories is of the soldiers coming    
 home from World War II.               
   A public meeting was held on        
 Wednesday 1st November 1944 to elect a
 'Welcome Home Fund' committee.        
 Reverend William Rock was Chairman and
 15 other people were elected. The     
 target was to raise Â£750, an enormous 
 amount in those days.                 
   There was a house to house which    
 raised Â£153-8s-6d, a whist drive on   
 December 15th which raised Â£40-1s-6d  
 and other things including a free gift
 sale that raised Â£440. At the sale    
 they sold Duck eggs, potatoes, lambs, 
 calves, haggis, a knitted penguin, a  
 bed jacket and a string bag. The fund 
 total was Â£790-2s-3d. Everyone in the 
 forces for more than a year got Â£20   
 and for less than a year they got Â£5. </content>
