		<content>  In 1970 the double track railway was 
 replaced by a single track.There are  
 nine passenger trains daily from      
 Monday to Saturday and three on       
 Sunday.The return fares from Insch to 
 Aberdeen are:Adults Â£3.80; Children   
 Â£1.90;and O.A.P's Â£3.80 if they don't 
 own a Railcard.                       
  The bus service by W.Alexander and   
 Sons Ltd. provides seven buses which  
 pass through Insch on weekdays,five   
 on Saturdays,and three on Sundays.The 
 route taken passes through the Square,
 and the return fares from Insch to    
 Aberdeen are:Adults Â£4.20; O.A.P.'s   
 and Children Â£2.10.                   
  The lack of job opportunities in     
 Insch means many people commute,by car
 especially,to Aberdeen,Dyce,Inverurie 
 and Huntly.                           
  Insch folk appear happy with their   
 road and rail services.               </content>
