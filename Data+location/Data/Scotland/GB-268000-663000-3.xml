		<title>03RENOVATIONS IN BARGEDDIE</title>
		<content>   In January 1984 workmen came to     
 Bargeddie to renovate all the         
 houses which had been built{in the    
{late thirties.}There was a lot of     
 vandalism and a lot of things were    
 stolen from the houses.               
   In my house and  a few others there 
 were{concrete floors.}They decided to 
 replace the concrete floors with      
{wooden floorboards.                   
   The houses were{rewired}and{new     
{units}were put in  the{kitchen and    
{bedrooms.                             
   We were given the choice of{fires   
{_gas,electricity or coal.}Most of the 
 residents chose{gas.                  
   The{roofs}on the houses were        
{retiled.                              
  During the time this was  taking     
 place the tenants of the houses  lived
 in{caravans}nearby.                   
                                       </content>
