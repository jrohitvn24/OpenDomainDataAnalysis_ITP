		<title>07DAIRY FARMING - STRANRAER</title>
		<content>  The farming around Stranraer is      
 mainly{Dairy}or dairy related. The    
 largest creamery of its kind in Europe
 is in Stranraer.                      
  'Gallahill Farm' is typical of the   
 kind of farm found in the area.       
        {*Gallahill Farm*              
  This farm has a herd of{80}milking   
 cows and 30 young cows in calf. The   
 farm stock also includes 50 mixed     
 dairy and beef calves and the all     
 important farm cats.                  
  The farmer mostly grows grass as a   
 crop for silage. Turnips and kale were
 sown in May and a little barley will  
 be ready for harvesting in late July. 
 This will also be used for silage.    
  Machinery found on the farm includes 
 tractors, silage cutters, harvesters  
 and threshers. A milk tanker calls    
 daily to collect the milk for the     
 Galloway Creamery.                    </content>
