		<title>20TRANSPORT PROBLEMS</title>
		<content> 50 years ago, people here used the few
 single track roads on foot. Today,    
 cars are an essential for use on the  
 modern roads which have been rebuilt  
 over the last decade. The nearest rail
 centre is Lairg 50 miles to the East. 
 Our mail &amp; passengers come here on the
 daily Mail bus. However, fuel is      
 costly, resulting in expensive food   
 and other essentials. We are lucky    
 enough to have a port here and many   
 boats use this for landing their      
 catches or refuelling. The fish       
 catches are transported by road to the
 major markets of Aberdeen &amp; England.  
 There is no provision for aircraft of 
 any description but there are one or  
 two emergency landing pads for        
 helicopters which have been used in   
 times of bad weather.
