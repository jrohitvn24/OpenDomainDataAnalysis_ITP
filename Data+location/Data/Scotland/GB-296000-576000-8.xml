 Cost = Â£9.136 million                 
 This is an inner town route that mixes
 bypass and town centre traffic        
 together.                             
 It would need: seven houses           
 demolished.Thirty-three acres of      
 potential housing land sterilised.    
 Requires substantial landscaping.     
 Local residents find this route       
 unacceptable.                         
 We asked residents of houses affected 
 by the bypass if they would fill in a 
 questionnaire about the bypass, here  
 are our results: 72% agreed with the  
 idea of the bypass, and 28% disagreed 
 with it.                              
                                       
 We asked the residents if they would  
 be allocated with new accommodation.
