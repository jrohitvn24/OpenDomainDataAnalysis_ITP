 Firth giving onto the North Sea. The  
 shore is sand, with deep water close  
 in &amp; a few rocks S of Embo, a small   
 fishing village created in the 19th   
 Century for people displaced in the   
 clearances. The only fishing now is a 
 few lobster boats but fisher folk     
 still live here &amp; a few are still     
 Gaelic speakers. The harbour is a     
 small pier S of the village.  Today   
 Embo is a tourist village with a big  
 caravan/camp site &amp; holiday complex   
 with laundry, bars, dancehall,        
 restaurant etc.  There is a village   
 shop &amp; PO.                            
 North of Embo are sand dunes behind   
 the beach, with flat farmland to the  
 W. To the S lies part of the Royal    
 Dornoch Golf Club's Championship Links
 Course, also affording fine coast     
 walks with magnificent views.         </content>
