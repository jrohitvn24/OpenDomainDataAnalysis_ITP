		<content> Newmilns is a small town with a       
 population of circa 4,000. Industries 
 are mainly light and are diversed, the
 two main ones being the manufacture of
 lace and crucibles for the steel      
 industries etc. Surrounding land is   
 mainly grassland used for dairy       
 cattle, although crops and sheep      
 grazing take place to a much lesser   
 scale. Although the industries are    
 thriving, they do not support  all of 
 the population and many people commute
 to work in Kilmarnock and other large 
 Ayrshire towns, making Mewmilns a     
 semi-dormitory town. There are all the
 usual types of shops and services for 
 such a town but there are no          
 chain-shops. Newmilns is cloisely     
 linked with the other valley towns,   
 Galston, Darvel and Hurlford and the  
 communities are very much interlinked,
 with a common secondary school at     </content>
