		<content> The church which is used was built in 
 1854.It is built of stone from        
 quarries on the island.The stone round
 the windows and doors is{yellow       
{sandstone}.This came from the shore   
 near the old church.It is roofed in   
{blue slate}.The pews,pulpit and doors 
 are{Oregon pine.}The inside roof is   
 red pine and so are the boxes the     
 paraffin lamps are attached to.       
 In the porch there is a list of all   
 the ministers who have been on the    
 island starting in 1566 with{Rev      
{Thomas Rattray}.The present minister  
 is{Rev Robert S Whiteford}.When the   
 church was built it was named the     
{United Associate Church}but is now the
 Parish Church.This is because the{old 
{Parish Church}is badly needing        
 repaired.The Church has 140           
 members.{Communion}is celebrated 4    
 times a year.                         </content>
