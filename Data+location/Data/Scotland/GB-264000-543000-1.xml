		<content> It is here that the River Dee meets   
 the open sea. The land on either side 
 of the bay is wild and wind-swept and 
 for the most part surrounded by       
 precipitous cliffs. The Ross headland 
 is very hilly and used mainly for     
 cattle and sheep farming. Save that   
 which connects several farms on the   
 way to the Ross Bay, there are no     
 roads, only tracks. Opposite is the   
 Little Ross  Island, with its         
 lighthouse, now operated              
 automatically. Across the bay lies    
 Torrs farm, famous for its champion   
 Clydesdale horses. Most of the land on
 this side however, is owned by the    
 Ministry of Defence as a              
 misile-testing range and is therefore 
 inaccessable to the public. It        
 consists of grassland and small wooded
 areas. The coast prior to the Range is
 a favourite haunt of anglers.         </content>
