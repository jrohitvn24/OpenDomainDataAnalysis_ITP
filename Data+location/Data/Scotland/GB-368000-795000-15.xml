		<content> I have chosen to write about two      
{Skipping Games}called 1.{'Bumper car'}
 and 2.{'High Low'}.I shall show the   
 rhymes in blue, instructions in white 
 1. {Bumper car,bumper car,            
{    Number forty eight,               
{    Went round the corner}(jump out){ 
{    Slammed on the brakes }(jump in)  
{    How many bumper cars did you see? 
{    1,2,3,4...} (the rope turns faster
 and faster and the person skipping    
 keeps on counting until he or she     
 trips at which point they are out.)   
 2.{High,low,medium,slow,dollies,      
{peppers,snakes and choice.            
{High}- turn the rope so that it       
 doesn't touch the ground.             
{Low}- crouch down low as you skip.    
{Medium}- skip normally.{Slow}- turn   
 the rope slowly.{Dollies}- crouch down
 low and suck your thumb as you skip.{
