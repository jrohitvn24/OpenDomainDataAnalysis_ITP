		<content> Shinty (or iomain camanachd as it is  
 known in Gaelic) has been in the      
 culture of the Celts for a long       
 time.In former days local woodlands   
 would supply camans which varied in   
 size style and quality.A ball was made
 from all kinds of material.Driftwood  
 probably provided Camans while corks  
 from fishermens nets served as balls. 
 Our present balls are cork based with 
 a leather cover and the camans made   
 from ash.The playing area for boys is 
 not more than 91m-46m and goals 2.58m 
 high-3.66m wide. The game starts with 
 a throw up,with crossed camans in the 
 air and has a referee and two goal    
 judges. A full game consists of twelve
 players but our school takes part only
 in six-a-side games.Dornie School has 
 won the Primary Schools Cup for the   
 last two years.
