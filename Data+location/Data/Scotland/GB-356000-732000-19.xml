		<title>19Separating Gardens.</title>
		<content>   In old records of the Carnoustie    
 area (some are as old as the original 
 Domesday Book) an old hedge is spoken 
 of and its position is given.Part of  
 the hedge still exists and is now used
 as a garden boundry.                  
   Nowadays there are many different   
 ways of separating gardens.A sample in
 Carnoustie was studied.{              
{                                      
{   GARDEN SEPARATION IN CARNOUSTIE    
 Open-plan   Hedges     Walls    Fences
   { 2         9          1         3  
                                       
   Mostly the gardens of the new houses
 are surrounded by a wall or are open- 
 plan.Some do have fences and hedges.  
 However, hedges are the most common   
 surrounding for the gardens of old    
 houses.Some of the old and the new    
 houses separate their gardens with    
 trees but this isn't common.          </content>
