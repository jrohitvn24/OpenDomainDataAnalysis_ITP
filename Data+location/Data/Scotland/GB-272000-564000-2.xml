		<content> The church has 180 members. Fifty or  
 sixty attend every Sunday. There are  
 about a dozen in the Sunday School.   
 The present church, the second on the 
 site, was built in 1751. There are no 
 records of when the previous one was  
 built but the earliest tombstone is in
 memory of Randolf Ross, who died 10th 
 December 1547. The bell tower of the  
 old church forms part of the new.     
 One of the tombs is of William Graham,
 a young Covenanter who was shot by a  
 party of Claverhouse's dragoons in    
 1682, while fleeing from his mother's 
 home at Mollance. Another is of       
 Reverend David Welsh, who was         
 professor of Church History at        
 Edinburgh and in 1843 Moderator of the
 General Assembly of the Church of     
 Scotland.
