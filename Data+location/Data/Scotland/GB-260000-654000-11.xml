		<title>11Origins of East Kilbride</title>
		<content>  Thirty three years ago the population
 of East Kilbride was just 2400. Now it
 is the sixth largest town in Scotland 
 with a population of 72000 housed in  
 23000 houses which have been built in 
 seven residential neighbourhoods.     
  The name Kilbride derives from Kil   
 from the Gaelic 'cil' (church or bury-
 ing place) and St Bryde who, although 
 Irish, is well known in the folklore  
 of Scotland and is said to have died  
 at Abernethy about 451 AD.            
  The New Town dates from a Draft Order
 of October 1946 which designated 10250
 acres as the site of a proposed New   
 Town under the New Towns Act of 1946. 
 The New Town (East Kilbride)          
 Designation Order was made on 6 May   
 1947 and East Kilbride was thus       
 Scotland's first New Town.
