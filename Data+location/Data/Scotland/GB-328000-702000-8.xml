		<title>08LOCAL HISTORY-WELL (cont.)</title>
		<content> The well in{1984}was very rusty, it   
 could hardly be seen against the stone
 background. Star pupils decided to    
 save the well and restore it. With the
 help of the waterboard and, in        
 particular{Mr.Bert Wheellan}, the well
 was lifted out of the ground. We were 
 surprised to see that the part of the 
 well that had been underground was the
 same length as the part above the     
 ground,namely 1 metre, therefore the  
 total height of the well was 2 metres.
 Mr. Wheellan started to clean the well
 at Carrieston Reservoir with a wire   
 brush and we went up to help one      
 afternoon. Mr.Wheellan spray painted  
 the well with grey undercoat, then it 
 was painted black, apart from the     
 lion's face which was painted gold. A 
 hole was dug next to the school door  
 in the school playground by Mr.       
 Wheellan and some of the parents      </content>
