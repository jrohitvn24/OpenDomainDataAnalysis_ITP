		<title>11BOWHOUSE FARM : FEEDING</title>
		<content> FEEDING THE DAIRY COWS                
 From{March to October}the cows graze  
 out of doors on the pastures. However,
 as Autumn approaches the cows are fed 
 a diet consisting of cattlecake,      
 brewsed barley, and pea straw which is
 high in protein. This prepares the    
 animals for the winter months.        
{Over the winter,}the cows are housed  
 in cubicles inside a barn and are fed 
 a diet of potatoes, silage, straw,    
 brewsed barley and cattlecake.        
 The controlled feeding of the cows    
 over the winter has the advantage of  
 the farmer knowing exactly how much   
 food the cows have been fed and this  
 leads to an increased and regular     
 production of milk. Over the summer   
 months, when the cows are grazing     
 freely on the pastures, milk output is
 irregular as it depends on the amount 
 of grass eaten by the cows.           </content>
