 Mossmorran is now nearing completion.

 essentially simple. The natural gas   
 liquid which is piped from St. Fergus 
 is split into four different factions 
 and supplied to clients. The flow is

 arrival and then passed into three    
 distillation columns. Ethane, propane 
 and butane are seperated leaving      
 behind natural gasoline the propane is
 purified and both this and the butane 
 are cooled in a refrigeration unit.
