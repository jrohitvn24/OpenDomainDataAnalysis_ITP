		<content> Children growing up in the village    
 have a fairly boring life. There      
 aren't many clubs and not much to do. 
 For the very young there is the       
 playgroup which is held twice a week. 
 For children aged 8 and under there   
 are swings and things.                
 For 9 year olds there is nothing      
 becuase they are too young for the    
 clubs. They just walk around the      
 streets playing games or most of the  
 boys in that age group go around being
 stupid throwing stones at other kids  
 etc.                                  
 For children over 10 there is a fair  
 amount to do. They can go to the      
 badminton and drama club. They can    
 play Football or Cricket or other     
 sports in surrounding fields. If the  
 weather is hot they can swim in the   
 River Urr.
