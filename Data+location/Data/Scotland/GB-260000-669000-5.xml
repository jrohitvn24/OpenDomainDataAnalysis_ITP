		<content> We chose to visit{pre-school groups}  
 when looking at education.  These     
 included Mother and Toddler groups    
 meeting in our own school; Wester     
 Cleddens Playgroup; Christian Centre  
 Playgroup; Auchinairn Community Centre
 Playgroup; Gaelic Playgroup; Acredyke 
 Nursery School.                       
 We were interested in the{Gaelic Group
 because it was only six months old.   
 Just after our visit they won the     
 award for the best decorated float in 
 the Bishopbriggs Gala. Most of the    
 children have parents who originally  
 came from the Highlands but only 4    
 have mothers who speak Gaelic. The    
 children pick up the language easily  
 but do not use it all the time.       
 In all the groups the children really 
 enjoyed playing with sand, water, glue
 paints and messy things! They liked to
 dress up and play with messy toys!    </content>
