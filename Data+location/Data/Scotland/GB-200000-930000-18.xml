		<title>18SHOPPING</title>
		<content>   There are{no}shops in our area now  
 but there used to be two shops, one in
{Culkein}and one in{Clashnessie.       
 However they closed down a long time  
 ago and a grocery van  started going  
 round{Assynt.}Nearby at{Clachtoll     
 there is a small shop where you can   
 buy milk, bread, and other essentials 
 but most people make a  weekly        
 shopping trip to Lochinver where there
 is a{baker, butcher newsagents etc.   
 There is also a {Post Office}in Stoer 
 where you can buy stationery.Many     
 people have to buy clothes, furniture,
 carpets etc. from mail order          
 catalogues. Otherwise people have to  
 travel 155 km to{Inverness}for their  
 shopping.                             
   Every Thursday a{fish van}brings    
 round locally caught fish, haddock,   
 plaice, smoked fish and  shellfish.  A
{fruit and veg. van}also calls weekly. </content>
