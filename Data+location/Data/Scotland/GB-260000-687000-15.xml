		<title>15Culcreuch House: FINTRY</title>
		<content> Culcreuch House (or Castle) styled as 
 the ancestral home of{Clan Galbraith  
 was originally a stronghold of the    
 Graham family who had a castle off the
 Denny road (now a ruin). Since being  
 sold by the Galbraiths,Culcreuch House
 has passed through many hands.        
                                       
 The 'Castle' so titled by a recent    
 owner is situated at the foot of the  
 Fintry Hills. It is an imposing place 
 in an impressive setting, overlooking 
 a loch and fine wooded policies,      
 including a{pinetum of rare trees.    
 The earlier part{1320}and the medieval
 tower{1460}have walls over 5 ft thick.
 Among its features is a{bottle dungeon
 and{aumbray}and some very fine old    
 panelling. A{Georgian wing }was added 
 later, this has a fine{Georgian spiral
{staircase}that leads to the top of the
 fourth storey.                        </content>
