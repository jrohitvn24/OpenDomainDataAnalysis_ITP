		<content> There are many types of houses in this
 area;from old tenements to high-rise  
 flats, bungalows to terraces, Georgian
 houses to modern villas. Some are     
 built of stone, others of brick.  In  
 some parts old property has been      
 demolished and new houses are being   
 built; in others buildings are being  
 sand-blasted, rewired and replumbed.  
 Many are having windows renewed &amp;fire 
 resistant doors installed.  In an     
 effort to cut down on vandalism, many 
 flats now have an entry phone system. 
 Old warehouses and big old houses(too 
 costly to run as family homes)have    
 been turned into offices or divided   
 into flats.  Sheltered housing        
 provides the elderly with small easily
 run homes and aa warden service.  Al- 
 :though many houses are still rented, 
 more people than ever before own their
 own homes.                            </content>
