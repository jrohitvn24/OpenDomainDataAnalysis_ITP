		<content> FARMS AND HOMES                       
    The earliest habitation in this    
 part of Ettrick Valley was a raised   
 hillock on the valley floor where an  
 ancient hut circle stood clear of the 
 regular floods.  Present buildings    
 have been sited on the hill slopes or 
 beside the main road. Most of the     
 buildings retain their original       
 character of farm or farm workers'    
 houses. At Shankend the old smithy    
 cottages and the East Lodge at        
 Thirlestane are all modernised. The   
 farm houses are large with many back  
 stairs, kitchens and pantries once    
 required by the maids and             
 herds.Shepherds'cottages have a byre  
 built alongside. It was traditional   
 that the shepherd had a house cow as  
 part of his annual wages. Tushielaw   
 Inn retains its original character as 
 a l9th century coaching inn.          </content>
