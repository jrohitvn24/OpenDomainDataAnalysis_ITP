 It is a coastal area to the South-East
 of St. Andrews. The land is undulating
 boulder clay, sloping gradually to the
 coast with a North-East aspect. The   
 highest point is Easter Balrymonth    
 Hill (109 metres) in the South of the 
 block. Local rock outcrops are of     
 sandstone which in the past have been 
 quarried. Soils generally are sandy   
 but fertile.                          
 There is almost a continuous rocky    
 shore with cliffs of 25 metres at     
 Kinkell Braes but they gradually      
 become lower towards the South-East.  
 Sublittorarly, the sea at St Andrews  
 is relatively shallow. At Bell Rock   
 Lighthouse, it is 20 fathoms which is 
 some 15 miles offshore.  The bottom is
 mud and sand.
