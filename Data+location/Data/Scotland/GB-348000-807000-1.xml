		<content> This area includes farmland, tree     
 plantations, and exposed hillsides.   
 The farmland is marginal to the hill  
 ground on th east side of the area.   
 Fields are worked to altitudes over   
 400m to grow barley turnips potatoes  
 and to provide hay and grazing for    
 cattle &amp; sheep. Most of the farms are 
 amalgamtions of smaller units but are 
 still struggling to provide a living  
 for the families that run them.Many of
 the hillsides  steeply sloping ground 
 betwen 300 and 500 metres altitude,   
 have been planted with spruce and pine
 trees. Being relatively young, these  
 plantations are mostly dense and      
 impenetrable on the soutehrn slopes   
 some shelter belts exist for live     
 stock protection self seeded pines are
 scatteed on te higher slopes but      
 struggle against exposure tothe       
 elements,                             </content>
