		<content> The village of Upper Largo is         
 surrounded by mixed farmland.The      
 nearest large settlement is Leven     
 (roughly 9,000 people) about 5km south
 west.The neighbouring settlements of  
 Lower Largo and Lundin Links are      
 around 1km to the south west on the   
 coast of Largo Bay.                   
 This village grew up mainly because of
 it's situation in relation to         
 surrounding large settlements.To begin
 with a pub was built in the main      
 street as a refreshment stop for      
 travellers in this area.In the 13th   
 century,a church was built.In the     
 1700's farm cottages were built.By the
 beginning of the 1800's Upper Largo   
 had grown into a small village,       
 attracting people who worked on farms 
 or in the industrial centre of        
 Levenmouth.
