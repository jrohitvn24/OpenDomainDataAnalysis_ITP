		<title>04Houses in Newtown</title>
		<content> The old Victorian houses in the area  
 were built of sandstone.These houses  
 have fancy lintels and date marks.    
     In the late 19th.Century terraced 
 houses were built for the railway and 
 mill workers.                         
     This century many houses have been
 built by the council though a large   
 number of householders are buying     
 their council houses.When a council   
 house becomes a private one we        
 generally notice new doors and windows
 quite soon.                           
     The council houses built soon     
 after the second World War are now    
 being modernised by the council.New   
 fireplaces,cupboards and kitchens are 
 being fitted.                         
     The newest council scheme is      
 called Whitefield.Very few private    
 houses have been built in recent      
 years.                                </content>
