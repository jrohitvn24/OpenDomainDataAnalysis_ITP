		<title>03THE DANGERS OF GARBOLE ROAD</title>
		<content>  When you go up the Garbole road you  
 will encounter quite few dangers.250m 
 up the road you will see an old track 
 going off on the left hand side of the
 road.On the right hand side of that   
 road is a big box with a small box    
 beside it.Explosives are in the big   
 and detonators in the small box.There 
 is a warning sign beside the boxes.   
  Further on up the Garbole road past  
 the loch,at the end of the track to   
 the left of Gaich there is a river.   
 Over the river there is a bridge made 
 by the scouts who camp there in       
 summer.The bridge is unsafe now with  
 the flooring broken in various places 
 along the bridge.If you want to go    
 there and cross it take someone else, 
 and be careful.                       
  Along the Garbole road past Gaich    
 there is a power station.There you    
 will have to be careful too.          </content>
