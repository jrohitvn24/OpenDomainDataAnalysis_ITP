		<title>18DISUSED RAILWAY LOSSIEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   In 1852 the Morayshire railway was  
 opened. The track connected Elgin with
 the Moray coast. The railway line     
 closed for passengers in 1965 and many
 people were sad. At that time it cost 
 sixpence (two and a half pence) and a 
 shilling (five pence) for an adult.   
 Freight continued for a further       
 eighteen months until 1966.           
   Eight trains a day left Lossiemouth.
 There was a goods train, passenger    
 trains, a sleeper train and a train   
 which took fish to Aberdeen and       
 Glasgow. Whenever a train left        
 Lossiemouth an old ship's bell was    
 rung. The ship's bell is now kept in  
 the Lossiemouth Fishing Museum. Today 
 the railway line is only used as a    
 footpath.
