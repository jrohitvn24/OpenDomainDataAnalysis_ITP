		<title>09FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> The Fire Station was built in 1937.   
 The full time station covers the whole
 of Kirkcaldy District. At the Fire    
 station they have six engines. There  
 are two spares, one water tender, one 
 water ladder, one decontamination unit
 and one hydraulic platform. There is  
 about half a mile of hose altogether  
 on a water tender. The water ladder   
 has four ladders ranging from 5 meters
 to 13.5 meters. The fire engines can  
 hold 400 gallons of water. There are  
 four shifts and 16 men on each shift. 
 On average Kirkcaldy Fire Station has 
 1,400 fires annually - grass fires in 
 summer, chimney fires in winter with  
 chip pan fires all year round. There  
 is a foam maker for oil fires, special
 tools and suits for chemical fires.   
 When there are no fires the firemen   
 test their equipment and paint the    
 hydrants.                             </content>
