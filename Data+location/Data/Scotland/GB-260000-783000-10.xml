 In winter we get a lot of snow. Cars  
 that travel past Drumochter Lodge     
 where I live on the A9 get snowed in. 
 At night the snow falls heavily. In   
 the morning the road is covered in    
 very deep snow. Sometimes we cannot   
 get to school. Last year we had 300   
 people and a baby stranded. Every day 
 my mum had to help my granny to feed  
 them. They stayed in the Lodge. The   
 snow did not stop until February. A   
 helicopter came to our house with     
 food. Drumochter was on T.V. The      
 people stayed for a week. The         
 snowplough and the police and rescue  
 services came and got all the cars    
 moving again. In the woods we found a 
 snow buggy that had crashed into a    
 tree.
