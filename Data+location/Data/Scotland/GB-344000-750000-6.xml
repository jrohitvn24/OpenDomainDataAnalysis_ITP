		<content>{Weaving.}Don Brothers make jute and   
 polyethylene to put on the backs of   
 carpets.They are used to make the     
 carpet thicker so it will last        
 longer.They also use a shuttle and    
 that makes the cross-way weft threads.
 The two products are sometimes made   
 into bags and some folk use them to   
 put weeds and grass and all different 
 kinds of things in.The products are   
 transported to other factories where  
 they are made into other articles.    
{Transport }Don Brothers have their    
 headquarters on St.James Road.It has  
 all the offices and the lorry depot.  
 There are about 20 lorries in the     
 fleet.Dons don't just have lorries.   
 They have all different sizes of vans.
 They also have factories in Dundee 14 
 miles from here.Dons is the biggest   
 employer in Forfar.The lorry drivers  
 all start at 6am and finish at 5pm.   </content>
