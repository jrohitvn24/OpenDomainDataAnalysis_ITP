		<content>  The day started off at 7.00am when it
 was time to get up. I had to check the
 cows and fields to see everything was 
 sound. At 9.00am I went into the house
 and had my breakfast. It was going to 
 be a busy day because the vet was     
 coming at 9.30 to inject the cows to  
 see if they have any diseases.He took 
 blood samples from all of the cows.   
 At 12.30 that job was finished. At    
 1.30pm we put all the cows back into  
 the fields where they had come from   
 the night before. At 2.00pm the vet   
 came back to burn the horns off the   
 small calves with a hot iron. The vet 
 gave them two jags to stop any pain.At
 4.00pm we started to clean up, and at 
 5.00pm I went in for my tea.But that  
 wasn't my day finished.I had to go and
 check the cow that was going to calf  
 and before I went to my bed I went    
 out once again. A long day!           </content>
