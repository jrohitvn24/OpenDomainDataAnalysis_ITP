		<title>14A Local Shop</title>
		<content> A.Voss is the main general store for  
 Baltasound and because of its position
 on the island is the biggest and most 
 well used of the island shops. It is  
 known locally as Skibhoul as this was 
 the building's original name. It has  
 petrol pumps and sells most things. It
 is open Tuesday's - Saturdays and has 
 5 full time and 2 part-time workers. A
 bakery is also attached. The older    
 workers in the shop have been there   
 many years but there are some young   
 girls who are in their first job. The 
 shop is busiest in summer with        
 tourists visiting the island. Most    
 people shop there at some time during 
 the week and many thought the prices  
 were a bit expensive which is a common
 complaint due to the expense of       
 bringing goods to such a remote area.
