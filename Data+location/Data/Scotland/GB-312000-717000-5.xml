		<content> from cattle shed built from local red 
 sandstone into ugly pre-fabricated    
 huts storing grain and the farmer's   
 machinery.The equipment can cost a lot
 of money and often it will take the   
 farmer a long time to pay it off.The  
 average tractor costs about Â£20,000,  
 an average harvester Â£40,000 and the  
 tyres of the tractor can cost up to   
 Â£500.So it is understandable that the 
 farmer must find good shelter to      
 protect his machinery from rust,caused
 by remaining outside.                 
    Poly-tun Growers are new to this   
 area this year.They hire fields from  
 local farmers for the intensive       
 growing of salads and vegetables      
 under polythene.This gives a 14 day   
 start over crops grown in the open    
 ground.All materials and labour are   
 provided by the company.Crops are     
 packed and distributed.               </content>
