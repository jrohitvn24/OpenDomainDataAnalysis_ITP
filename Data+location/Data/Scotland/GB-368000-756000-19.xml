		<content> The{Montrose}Local Plan of June 1980  
 has highlighted the main issues       
 relating to transport.They include    
 trends in road traffic volumes through
 the town centre;parking provision;    
 accident patterns;public transport    
 services and harbour and airfield     
 traffic.                              
 A Relief road is badly needed for{    
{Montrose,}but problems have arisen in 
 finding a suitable route.Disagreements
 have occured over this matter.        
 Most accidents occur on the A92 route 
 from Bridge Street to Brechin Road.The
 High Street parking problem is mainly 
 due to careless public parking.       
 The Ball House square has now been    
 made into a pedestrian precinct.      
 Problems are caused by the increased  
 number of lorries passing through the 
 town.It is well served by bus,rail    
 and taxi services.                    </content>
