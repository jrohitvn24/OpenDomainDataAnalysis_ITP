		<content> Hurlford Community Centre was built in
 1974. Here's a list of the activities 
 held at the Community Centre. There   
 are meetings, games, nightclubs,      
 discos, garden clubs, dancing and     
 Majorettes. The Community Centre can  
 seat up to 350 people at plays and can
 hold up to 300 people at discos.The   
 centre is made of wood and brick.Ayr  
 County Council built the centre and it
 took quite a while.Strathclyde own the
 Community Centre and it is the only   
 one in Strathclyde to have two        
 caretakers and one cleaner. There are 
 playgroups every Tuesday and Thursday.
 Local councillors visit the centres   
 frequently. There are tea mornings    
 held daily and a chidrens' games night
 weekly. Crookedholm Community Centre  
 is similarly organised. The local     
 school has its main assemblies there.
