		<title>13THE BADGER</title>
		<content>{Badger                                
 The badger has quite a big set with   
 lots of tunnels.They can have a main  
 entrance,two breeding chambers,a      
 sleeping chamber,another entrance,an  
 old breeding chamber,and quite a few  
 communicating tunnels.                
 In the old days men used to catch     
 badgers and put them in a barrel on   
 its side then get two bull dogs to go 
 into the barrel and fight and the dogs
 always won but this is against the    
 law now.                              
 The badger is about 1 metre long and  
 weighs up to 40 pounds.It is mainly a 
 blackish grey a white head with a     
 strip of black on each side. They eat 
 insects,mice,voles,fruit,nuts,snakes, 
 rabbits and lots of others.It has been
 seen at Inverarnie a few times.
