		<title>02LOCH ETIVE,CONNEL</title>
		<content> Loch Etive is 18 miles long and up to 
 1 mile wide in places.It is the least 
 salty of all the sea lochs on the west
 coast of Scotland.This is because all 
 the rain which falls on its huge      
 catchment area drains out into Loch   
 Etive by the Pass of Brander and Loch 
 Awe. The tides in the loch have been  
 recorded for 7 consecutive days by a  
 portable tide gauge and it has been   
 found that the tide range in the loch 
 is only half of that outside it.The   
 Falls of Lora is the best example of a
 sea waterfall in the world.Because of 
 the narrow shallow entrance the water 
 coming in at high tide cannot get out 
 fast enough at low tide.              
 On the north side of the loch,where it
 is narrowest,half way between its head
 and its mouth are the granite quarries
 of Bonawe.
