 Festival in August 1985,to raise money
 for church funds.There were 31        
 arrangements which were arranged by   
 the ladies of the parish under the    
 supervision of the Pentland Flower    
 Club.                                 
 One of the displays  was about the    
 Picts who were the first Christian    
 people in the area.                   
 Another of the displays was about the 
 Lang Whang which was the Edinburgh    
 to Lanark road. This road had a fierce
 highwayman called Captain Billie      
 Bailie.He wore a red cloak with a     
 sword by his side.He also had a pack  
 of greyhounds with him.               
 Another arrangement showed the Shale  
 Mining Industry which was  started by 
 James Young in 1850.                  
 Altogether it was a great success.They
 raised Â£1850.                         </content>
