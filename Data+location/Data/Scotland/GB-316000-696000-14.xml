		<title>14Lochore Miners Welfare Inst.</title>
		<content>  The Institute was opened in 1934 by  
 the Coal Industry Social Welfare      
 Organisation (CISWO). Clubs like these
 were opened all over Scotland. Lochore
 Institute was licensed in 1958. The   
 colliery in the area at that time was 
 the MARY PIT so the gala was known as 
 the{MARY PIT GALA.}In 1967 it became  
 an open gala as the club membership   
 became available to people outwith the
 coal industry. The gala is for all    
 members and their families. It is     
 financed by a yearly membership of    
 Â£2.25 for non-mining members, and     
 members in the mining industry have a 
 weekly deduction from their pay of    
 about 8-10p. Membership fees cover    
 Christmas parties, galas, old folks   
 treats and hire of the hall for       
 weddings etc. at a reduced fee. The   
 gala takes place at 'The Big House'   
 (Lochore House).     Alan Shields (11)</content>
