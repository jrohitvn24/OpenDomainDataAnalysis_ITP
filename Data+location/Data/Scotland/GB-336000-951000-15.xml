		<content> Hillhead School held the senior sports
 in which the 4 house teams Whaligoe,  
 Girnigoe, Sandigoe and Shelligoe      
 competed. Primary 4, 5, 6 and 7 all   
 had the same races which were the flat
 race, sack race, skipping race,       
 shuttle relay, tug of war and the     
 slow cycle race. The primary 6 and 7  
 got throwing a cricketball, highjump  
 and the longjump.If there were too    
 many people in a race they split it up
 into heats and then a final. There    
 were some parents watching their      
 children run. There was a tuck shop   
 selling crisps, sweets and drinks in  
 between races. Finally there was a    
 long track circuit race for primary 6 
 and 7 with two from each house taking 
 part. Whaligoe and Girnigoe were joint
 winners of the sports shield.
