		<title>10RECOVERY SERVICES</title>
		<content> There are several recovery services in
 the Dairsie area so there is a rota   
 list for service which the police use.
 The trucks in Dairsie are a Bedford a 
 Ford and a Landrover. The Landrover   
 belongs to the garage and the other   
 two belong to my Dad and his partner. 
 There are lots of crashes in winter   
 and Christmas and in summer.The reason
 for the crashes in winter is the snow 
 and ice on the roads and in the summer
 the people on holiday in the area. It 
 is quite in Spring time and Autumn.One
 of the recovery services has a Hiab   
 which lifts one ton and one of the    
 other trucks lifts up to five tons and
 has a bar for towing lorries. The     
 landrover has a portable lifting gear.
