		<title>15THE RANGERS.</title>
		<content> Stephen and I went to interview Alec  
 Cargill,the chief Ranger,of Beecraigs 
 country park.                         
 Beecraigs opened as a country park    
 in 1972 when it was taken over from   
 the water board,by Lothian Regional   
 Council.The region now funds and      
 controls the area.The water board     
 looked after the Beecraigs reservoir  
 which was built by German P.O.Ws. in  
 World War 1.                          
 At Beecraigs one Ranger,one           
 supervisor and a workman live in 1930 
 style houses.The other Rangers get    
 there by car and the workmen get      
 picked up by vans.The number of       
 workmen varies at times to cover the  
 work to be done.                      
 Alec was given the job as he was      
 able to teach outdoor activities.
