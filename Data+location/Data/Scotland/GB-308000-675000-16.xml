		<title>16A LOCAL HISTORIC RUIN</title>
		<content> This building,North of Winchburgh,is  
 complete to the wall head,but         
 roofless.It compreses a main block of 
 three storeys with tall square towers 
 at each end.The upper floors are      
 reached by tall stair-turrets.        
    At one time this fine 16th century 
 house was surrounded by elaborately   
 planned gardens.Now these gardens are 
 rough pastures for sheep and horses.It
 was at one time rather remote but with
 the advert of the M9                  
 motorway,motorists now have a fine    
 view of it.                           
    The Durhams of Duntarvie were once 
 the hands here and presumably the     
 builders,but by 1628 it was in the    
 lairds of the Hamiltons,the Earls of  
 Abercorn was confined here for        
 religious non-conformity after a short
 spell in the Tolbooth Prison in       
 Edinburgh.                            </content>
