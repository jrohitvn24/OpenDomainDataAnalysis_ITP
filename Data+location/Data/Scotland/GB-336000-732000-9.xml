		<title>09Attractions at Camperdown</title>
		<content> In{Camperdown Adventure Playpark}there
 is an ornate setting of old ships.The 
 Manpower Services Commission chose    
 ships set realistically on a bed of   
 sand for a special reason.The Earl of 
 Camperdown, from whom the park  and   
 the Earl take their title,won a great 
 victory at the "Battle of Camperdown".
 This battle was between the British   
 and Dutch navies and this is the      
 reason why the Union Jack and the     
 Dutch flag are displayed on the masts 
 of the ships.The playpark has been    
 built to a high standard, with little 
 ships for toddlers and larger frigates
 incorporating death slides,climbing   
 frames and chutes.                    
 Further south is{Camperdown Caravan   
{Park.}It is in a country setting      
 surrounded by bushes,flowers and      
 trees.Campers can also be accomodated.
 Who could ask for anything more?      </content>
