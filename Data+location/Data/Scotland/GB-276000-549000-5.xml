		<title>05Farmwork in Summer</title>
		<content> My Dad is a tractor man. He gets up at
 seven o'clock in the morning and goes 
 away to work at eight o'clock. He     
 starts work at half past eight. When  
 he gets to work he checks his tractor 
 to see if it is in good condition.    
 Then he gets all the other tractors   
 ready too. He takes all the silage    
 trailers out to the silage fields.    
 Silage is grass which is cut in the   
 summer and then is stored till the    
 winter when the cattle eat it. When he
 is finished cutting the silage he puts
 his tractor in the shed and the he    
 comes home. Sometimes it is five      
 o'clock but it is later when he is    
 busy. There are two, and sometimes    
 three cuts of silage in the summer. It
 is stored in silage clamps on the farm
 and as it gets older it has a funny   
 smell but the cattle like it and it is
 nutritious.                           </content>
