		<content> We have a lot of farms in our block.  
 Most of them are dairy cows and crops.
 Crofts is quite a big dairy farm      
 owned by Mr Henry. He keeps pigs too  
 and has some crops like barley and    
 silage. Nearly every farm has silage. 
 Mr Milligan owns a big farm called    
 Culvennan. It is a big dairy farm with
 a lot of technology in evidence. Mr   
 Milligan has won more silage          
 competitions than any other farmer in 
 Scotland.                             
 Mr Henry owns Crofts which is quite   
 big. Mr Johnstone owns Bridgestone. It
 is smaller than Culvennan and has     
 cattle and silage.                    
 Mr Martin owns Camp Douglas, which is 
 fairly small. It has some dairy cattle
 and silage. Mr Neil owns Boat Croft.  
 It is just a house. Mr McWilliam owns 
 Marchfield Farm. He does Bed &amp;        
 Breakfast at Â£7.00 a night.           </content>
