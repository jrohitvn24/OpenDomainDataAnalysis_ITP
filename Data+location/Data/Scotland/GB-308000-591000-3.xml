  On the 15th of August 1984 at 7.30pm 
 a lorry carrying dye was going south  
 on the A74 at Johnstonebridge .       
   Its tyre blew off and the lorry went
 across the central reservation and    
 diagonally into a house. The cabin    
 ended up in the living room.The driver
 was badly hurt. Luckily the occupants 
 of the house were in the kitchen at   
 the time. The blue and purple dye was 
 in containers which burst and the dye 
 went everywhere in the room and       
 beyond. This left purple and blue     
 furniture and even the grass outside  
 was purple and blue.                  
    When the lorry had stopped the     
 engine was still running so a local   
 man switched it off. It  was very     
 lucky that the lorry did not hit the  
 nearby filling station and cause an   
 explosion.                            </content>
