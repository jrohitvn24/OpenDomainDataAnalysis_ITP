 There are two teams; one is the fox   
 and the other the hounds.  The fox    
 team makes up a word with a letter for
 each person in the team, then they go 
 and hide.  The hounds team hunt them  
 out, get the letters one at a time,   
 and make up the word.                 
                                       
{HOPSCOTCH}                            
 This is a game played in the          
 playground.  Sometimes it is called   
 'Peevers' in Scotland.  A set of      
 numbered squares is drawn in chalk or 
 painted on the tarmac and the players 
 kick a tin while balancing on one leg.
 They must land on squares, not lines, 
 or they are out. When a player has    
 visited all the squares once, he      
 chooses one of his own and the others 
 must never set a foot in it when it is
 their turn to play.                   </content>
