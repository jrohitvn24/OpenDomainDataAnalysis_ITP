		<title>18A Day in the Life of Damian</title>
		<content>   I woke up at 7:00 and had my break- 
 fast with my 4 sisters and 2 brothers.
 I had my usual breakfast of Weetabix, 
 toast and tea.                        
   I packed my bag and set off for     
 school.When I reached the bus-stop the
 bus was there. The journey was boring.
 I go to Holy Cross High, Hamilton.    
   At 9:00 the bell rang, and I went to
 my first class, English. My next class
 was French. At interval I bought a can
 of ginger beer. Registration was hec- 
 tic as usual. After this I had Maths. 
   At lunchtime I ate my packed lunch  
 and went to Basketball. I had music   
 (my worst subject). My last subject   
 was Religious Education.              
   At hometime I avoid the bus bays    
 because I dislike the noise. At home I
 had my dinner then watched TV. At     
 11:30 I had supper and then went to   
 bed until 7:00 the next morning.      </content>
