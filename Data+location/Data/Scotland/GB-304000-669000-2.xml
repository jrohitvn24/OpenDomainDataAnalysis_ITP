		<content>   This area of Central Scotland       
 consists of parts of the villages of  
 Pumpherston, Uphall Station, Uphall   
 and Dechmont and parts of the town of 
 Broxburn.                             
   The most spectacular feature of this
 area is the shale bings around        
 Pumpherston. These Bings are the      
 by-product of the shale oil industry  
 which was once dominant in the        
 area. The towns grew around this once 
 thriving industry and are now well    
 established communities.              
   The surrounding countryside mainly  
 consists of farmland and smallholdings
 Part of the Union Canal also runs     
 through this area. This once busy     
 canal is now disused as a means of    
 transport but provides recreational   
 activities.
