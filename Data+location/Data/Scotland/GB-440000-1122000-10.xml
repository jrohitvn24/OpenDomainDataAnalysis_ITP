		<title>10CHURCHES IN SANDWICK</title>
		<content>                                       
   There are several churches in       
 Sandwick. At Hoswick there is the     
 Brethren hall. Visiting preachers     
 preach there each week.               
   At Stove there are 2 churches side  
 by side. The Methodist church is the  
 smaller of the two. There is a plaque 
 on the outside which tells that it was
 built in 1828 and extended in 1893.   
 Visiting preachers provide one service
 each Sunday.                          
   The United Free Church of Scotland  
 is alongside the Methodist church. Two
 services are held each Sunday and the 
 preacher is Mr Tom Ireland who lives  
 in the manse nearby.                  
   The Church of Scotland is situated  
 alongside the  cemetery at Sandwick.  
 It is the largest of the village      
 churches. The Rev.E.McMillan is the   
 minister.                             </content>
