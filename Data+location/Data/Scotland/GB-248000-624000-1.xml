		<title>01LAND S. OF MACHLINE VILLAGE</title>
		<content> This area is predominantly intensively
 managed grassland and grazing land for
 dairy cattle. There are several red   
 sandstone quarries being infilled with
 waste products before being returned  
 to grazing land. A main road          
 travelling south passes through the   
 north west corner of the block,       
 closely followed by a main-line       
 railway. Both pass over the Liner Ayr.
 A feature of this area is the largest 
 single span stone built viaduct in the
 world. The only commercial or         
 industrial projects are a creamery and
 an optical works, both occupying small
 sites near the river. The people who  
 work there live mainly in the nearby  
 villages of Machline, Catrine and     
 Cumnock. There is a small general     
 hospital in the north eastern corner  
 of the block which is set in the      
 grounds of a derelict mansion house - </content>
