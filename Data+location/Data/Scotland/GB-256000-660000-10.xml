		<content> Strathclyde Fire Station in Queen's   
 Park was opened in 1896 to serve the  
 growing built-up area around it. The  
 station covers Pollokshields,         
 Shawlands, Rutherglen, Cathcart,      
 Govanhill and Crosshill and has two   
 fire engines on call at all times. On 
 average, the fire station receives    
 eight calls a day but not all are     
 emergencies. Some are domestic calls  
 such as people being locked out of    
 their homes. Unfortunately, the fire  
 station is plagued by hoax calls.     
 Access to and from the station is     
 increasingly difficult due to traffic 
 congestion. In a day, a fireman's     
 duties include fire drill, maintenance
 of engines and equipment, physical    
 training and lectures.Sometimes the   
 station is visited by school parties  
 and the firemen organise sponsored    
 drives for charity.                   </content>
