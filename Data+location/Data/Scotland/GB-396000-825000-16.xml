		<content> This area,which contains the estuary  
 of the River Ythan, is popular with   
 ornithologists.Some of the birds which
 come to nest here are Heron,Eider     
 duck,Swans,Oystercatchers and Sparrows
 There are some other rare species of  
 birds.Eider Road,Mavis Bank,Curlew    
 Avenue and Laverock Road were named   
 after the birds that come here.Part of
 the estuary forms Forvie Nature       
 Reserve where Terns are protected     
 during the nesting season.Lead        
 weights used by fishermen cause the   
 death of some birds.                  
 Once some black Swans that had escaped
 from a Zoo came to the                
 estuary.Pectoral Sandpiper has been   
 seen only once in Newburgh.It is a    
 very rare bird.                       
 There is a Heron resident in this     
 area.It stays near the river estuary  
 in Newburgh.                          </content>
