 up at 7.30am.My big brother goes out  
 to school at 8.15am.He goes to Marr   
 College in Troon.Troon is 5 miles away
 so he has to catch the bus.There are  
 3 different buses at 3 different      
 times.Our school starts in the morning
 at 9.00am.We get a break at 10.30am   
 till 10.45am and our lunch time is at 
 12.15pm till 1.25pm.We usually come   
 back to school at 1.00pm so we can    
 have a game of something in the       
 playground.The end of lunch time is at
 1.25pm and we go back into school     
 until the home_time bell rings at     
 3.25pm.We go home and do our homework 
 which is usually either Maths or      
 Language and Spelling.Then we get     
 changed and go out to play till tea   
 time which is about 5.30pm.After tea  
 in the summer we can go out to play   
 again or in winter we watch T.V.      </content>
