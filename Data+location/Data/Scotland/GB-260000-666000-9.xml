		<title>09A weekend-Bobby Kenney</title>
		<content> I am a sixty-two year old storeman    
 from Balornock,Glasgow.Here is an     
 account of how I spent the weekend of{
{17th to 19th May 1985.}On Friday the  
 17th I left my house at 6.30pm with my
 wife to go to the C.Y.C.This stands   
 for Christian Youth Centre and is a   
 youth club I help to run in my local  
 church.I do various crafts eg nail    
 pictures and woodwork with boys aged  
 between 11 and 16.On Saturday I went  
 into town to do some shopping.I also  
 visited Glasgow's famous market"The   
 Barras".In the evening I stayed at    
 home and relaxed in front of the tele-
 vision.On Sunday morning I went to    
 church and in the afternoon I visited 
 my son and his wife as it was my grand
 -daughter's 5th birthday.She opened   
 her presents and then we had a special
 birthday tea.We returned home at 10pm 
 and watched T.V. before bed at 11.30. </content>
