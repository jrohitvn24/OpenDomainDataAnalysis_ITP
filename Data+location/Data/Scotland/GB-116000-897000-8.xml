		<title>08DAY IN THE LIFE OF A CROFTER</title>
		<content> In Harris there are lots of crofts and
 crofters.In each of the seasons the   
 crofter has one main job.In spring he 
 goes out to see his flock of sheep and
 new born lambs.In summer he will go   
 out and shear all his sheep and dip   
 them in a bath.He also has to cut hay 
 for the winter months when his animals
 may not get enough on his croft.In the
 autumn he lifts his crops.the main    
 crop is potatoes.He must also make    
 sure his hay is dry because he won't  
 get another chance to get it dryed.In 
 the winter he must make sure his sheep
 get enough to eat from the ground,If  
 not he will have to take some of the  
 hay he cut in the summer.He must go   
 out twice a day to make sure his sheep
 get fed properly.In the evening the   
 crofter gets a little chance to relax 
 with his family around the fire as    
 there is always some job to do.       </content>
