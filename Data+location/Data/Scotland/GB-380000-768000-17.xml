		<content> Built in 1868, it was the dream come  
 true of a native of the village called
 Kate Wyllie, who wanted to establish a
{place of worship}and contributed      
 significantly to its cost by the      
 results of selling fish round the     
 doors.                                
 At one time weddings were performed   
 there, a practice which has now died  
 out, although there is no particular  
 reason why this should be. It remains 
 the only place of worship to this day 
 and services are held once a week, as 
 well as{Sunday School and the Woman's 
{Guild,}all under the auspices of the  
{Church of Scotland.                   
 It is one of the few local places     
 where the old-fashioned 'Redemption'  
 or Sankey-type hymns are regularly    
 sung and is indeed an "Ancient        
 Landmark" in these modern times.
