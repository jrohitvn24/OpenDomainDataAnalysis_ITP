 straddles the main A92 trunk road.The 
 The village has a small shop, a       
 garage, a blacksmith's and a motor and
 agricultural engineers and            
 contractors.                          
   There is a major{cross-roads}in the 
 village which has been the scene of   
{many serious accidents}over the years.
 One of the chief contributors to      
 these accidents is the speed at which 
 many vehicles travel through the      
 village, despite the 30mph. speed     
 limit.  There are several children    
 living in the village and their       
 parents feel that their lives are at  
 risk.  In fact the residents feel so  
 strongly that something should be done
 to make their village a safer place   
 that they have raised the matter on   
 more than one occasion with their MP.
