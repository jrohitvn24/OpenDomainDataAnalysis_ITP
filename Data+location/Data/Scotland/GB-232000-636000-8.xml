{Public transport}is provided by 3     
 companies, Western S.M.T., A.A.       
 Buses, and A.1 Bus Company.           
                                       
 The{A.1 company}was started in the    
 1920's by the miners of the local     
 villages to travel to Ardrossan from  
 Kilmarnock.                           
   The A.1 company get on very well    
 with the other companies who also     
 operate in the area. The company have 
 been seriously affected by the growth 
 in the number of private cars and have
 been forced to slim their fleet of    
 vehicles, and consequently their staff
 has been reduced.The whole company    
 still employs about 130 people.       
   To replace each bus with a new one, 
 which is necessary from time to time, 
 costs the company between Â£70000 and  
 Â£100000 for each vehicle.             </content>
