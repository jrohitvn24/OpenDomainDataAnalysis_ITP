		<title>17ST FITTICK'S WELL</title>
		<content> St Fittick's Well used to be on the   
 beach at Nigg Bay where freshwater    
 gurgled up and flowed down into the   
 sea.Sadly the well has now disappeared
 due to the continual process of       
 coastal erosion.                      
 St Fittick was a French Saint of Scots
 descent who had been sent to preach to
 the Picts by the Bishop of Meaux.When 
 his boat was caught in a storm he was 
 swept overboard and cast up on the    
 shore of Nigg.He originally found the 
 well later to be named after him.     
 The well became famous for its        
 curative powers and twice a year on   
 the first Sunday in May and on 30th   
 August, St Fittick's Day, local people
 would make a pilgrimage to this well, 
 though this practise gradually ceased 
 as religous beliefs changed.
