		<title>08COMMUNITY FARMING IN ERSKINE</title>
		<content> Lamont Farm in Erskine was opened in  
 1979.  It is a community farm which is
 open to the public.  The farm is run  
 by volunteer workers and depends on   
 donations from visitors to finance the
 feeding of the animals.  It gives     
 children the opportunity to sample    
 farm life by taking part in chores    
 such as feeding the animals and       
 cleaning out the sheds.  The farm is  
 visited by many of the local schools  
 because of its educational value and  
 some of the children spend their      
 holidays working on the farm.  It     
 occupies approximately 5 acres of land
 and has become a home for a variety of
 animals such as, horses, cows, sheep, 
 hens, rabbits and a fox.  Bees are    
 also kept  and the honey is sold.     
 Vegetables can also be bought at      
 Lamont Farm.  A picnic area is        
 provided for the many visitors.       </content>
