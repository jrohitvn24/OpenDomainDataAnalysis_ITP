		<title>10A FIRE AT HOME</title>
		<content>   I lived on the ground floor. My wee 
 nephew Henry set the living room on   
 fire at half past ten one morning. He 
{lit paper and stuck it down the chair.
 There were 4 people in the house at   
 the time. During the fire Dad ran up  
 the hall to see if Henry was there and
 the flames singed his hair and        
 eyebrows. Someone kicked the door in  
 and told him Henry was outside so he  
 shut all the doors to stop the flames 
 spreading and he jumped out of the    
 back window. Someone grabbed a ladder 
 and helped the people above onto their
 verandas. They climbed down the       
 verandas with their children. The fire
 brigade came in 5 minutes. The living 
 room was right through to the brick,  
 the hall had hardly any ceiling and   
 the rooms were all smoke damaged.{We  
{were not insured for fire}so it's     
 going to cost a lot of money.         </content>
