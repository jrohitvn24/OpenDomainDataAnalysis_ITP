		<title>10THE LANGUAGE OF BALMEDIE</title>
		<content> We speak a lot of different forms of  
 language in Balmedie.In the classroom 
 we speak a standard form of English.  
 At home we speak in a scottish dialect
 and in the playground we also speak   
 in a scottish dialect.People in the   
 community who like different forms of 
 music are called different types of   
 names.Those who like the music of     
 Michael Jackson are called Posers.    
 Others are called,Casuals,mods and    
 heavies.We also have "In-words",some  
 of which are,hippies,wallys,wimps,    
 smart,keen and aceic.                 
    These are some examples of old     
 scottish words, REEK=SMOKE, FEEL=IDIOT
 SHELTIES=PONIES, DOUP=BACKSIDE        
 MUCKING OUT=CLEANING, FIT LIKE= HOW   
 ARE YOU.We think that the scottish    
 language is much better than standard 
 English.
