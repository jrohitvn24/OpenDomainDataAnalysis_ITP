		<content> This is an urban area and as such has 
 few open spaces apart from the large  
 parks. However we have near the       
 Langside area, a small patch between  
 Bellwood Street and Tantallon         
 Road, the Bluebell Wood. A group      
 from the Manpower Services and        
 children from the local primary school
 are trying to tidy these woods. They  
 began by picking up all the rubbish   
 and cleared the ground. Following     
 weeks were spent planting trees,      
 bushes and flowers which will be      
 attractive as habitats and food       
 sources for animals and insects. The  
 plan is to return the woods to the    
 wildlife. The children find the work  
 very rewarding although they are often
 discouraged to find more rubbish      
 thrown about. This is becoming a      
 little easier as more and more people 
 become aware of the childrens work.   </content>
