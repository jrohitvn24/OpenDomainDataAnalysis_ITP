 Children leave the primary school at  
 the end of Primary 7 when they are 11 
 years old. They then have to attend   
 secondary school either at Lochaber   
 High in Fort William or in the high   
 school in Portree, Isle of Skye.      
 The children from the small isles     
 present a problem to the Education    
 Authority because they are unable to  
 get home at weekends because of the   
 ferry service. Hostels are available  
 at most Highland secondary schools for
 pupils who live too far away to travel
 in each day. However, most of these   
 pupils can get home at weekends so the
 hostels shut then. This in effect     
 means that children as young as 11 are
 homeless and without supervision at   
 weekends. The parents therefore have  
 to find adequate lodgings for their   
 children.                             </content>
