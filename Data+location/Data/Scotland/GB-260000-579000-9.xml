		<title>09FARMING IN DALRY(KIRK)</title>
		<content>    The average farm covers 300 acres  
 and produces store sheep, breeding    
 sheep and store cattle. The sheep are 
 mainly  Blackfaced/Blue Leicester     
 crosses but there are two small       
 pedigree Blue Leicester flocks.       
    Most of the cows have Galloway and 
 Hereford blood and can stay out,      
 feeding calves, all year round but    
 increasingly stock is being           
 overwintered in sheds.Home produced   
 hay, silage,barley,oats,rape and root 
 crops supplement the grazing.         
    The cows are served by a           
 continental breed of bull such as a   
 Charolais.                            
    In the autumn both store sheep and 
 cattle are sold at auction for        
 finishing on better ground,while much 
 of the breeding stock is sold to farms
 in England and Wales.
