		<content>    The children from North Kessock and
 Charleston go to Drumsittal School.   
 There are nine children in P.7.Eight  
 of those have parents who use their   
 cars to go to Inverness to work and to
 shop in the supermarkets.             
 Between the villages and the school   
 runs the A.9.a very busy dual         
 carriageway,with an underpass for the 
 schoolchildren and for cattle.The     
 children are safer on the school bus. 
 On Sundays they go cycling and watch  
 T.V.Three go to Sunday School and four
  to church.Family dinner is chicken or
 roast beef.Some visit relatives in    
 Inverness.Sunday night is bath night. 
 Children like singing and playing     
 instruments.In May they played in "The
 Snow Queen"in Eden Court Theatre.In   
 June the school won six awards in the 
 Dingwall Music Festival.Only one child
 lives on a farm.                      </content>
