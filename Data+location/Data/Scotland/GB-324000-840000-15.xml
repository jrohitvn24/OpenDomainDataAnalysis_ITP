 schools, hotels, in the playpark and  
 in the Fleming Hall and other halls.  
 In the schools there are sometimes    
 concerts plays or pantomines, as well 
 as discos.                            
 Christmas parties, outings, fireworks 
 and playschemes are arranged by       
 schools and the community, while      
 dances and discos take place in the

 or Aberdeen to see concerts, films and
 shows.                                
 There is a public library beside the  
 High School which is well stocked by
