		<title>18Industry in Kelso</title>
		<content> The industrial estate in Kelso is at  
 Pinnacle Hill. There are a lot of     
 factories there and some of them are  
 Neves, Keltek and Forbes. The people  
 in the factories earn good wages and a
 lot of people work there. The factory 
 workers make things like light bulbs, 
 computers and knitwear. The factories 
 in our industrial estate do not spread
 pollution but other towns are not so  
 lucky. Some of the people who work at 
 the factories do night shift and they 
 sleep in the daytime instead of at    
 night. At the industrial estate there 
 are a lot of big vans and dozens of   
 cars. It is the only industrial estate
 in Kelso. A lot of people who work    
 there do not like their jobs very much
 but they have to stay there because   
 they might not get a job anywhere     
 else. 8 parents of children in our    
 class work in the industrial estate.  </content>
