		<content> On Sanday there have been and still   
 are a number of{Church buildings.     
 Within our 3km x 4km block we have    
{three}such{sites. Two}of the{Churches 
 are{not}now in{use,}both being{ruins. 
 One,{Lady Kirk,}(M.R.678399) is a     
 substantial ruin. The other, the{old  
{Cross Kirk,}(M.R.655393), down at     
 Backaskail, is a complete ruin (only  
 a few stones left standing). They both
 have graveyards, being two of the     
 three cemeteries on the island. The   
 third Church in the area is at        
 Broughtown (M.R.659409), the{Cross    
{Kirk. This Church is used}on          
 alternate Sundays in the summer,      
 alternating with the East Church in   
 Lady, for services, and also during   
 the whole of January, February and    
 March. The Cross Kirk is a small 'one 
 roomed' building, seating 170 people.
