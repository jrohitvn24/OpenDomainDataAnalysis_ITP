		<title>10Fishing -The Fish Farm</title>

     There is a fish farm at           
 Johnstonebridge where they rear       
 rainbow trout from North America. They
 keep rainbow trout because they grow  
 faster and are cheaper to feed than   
 brown trout. The fish farm opened in  
 1977. Later that year there was very  
 bad flooding in this area. The river  
 overflowed and the fish were washed   
 away and the local people were picking
 fish up out of the fields and puddles 
 as the waters receded. The fish farm  
 is owned by Annandale Estates as, are 
 the fishing rights on parts of the    
 river.
