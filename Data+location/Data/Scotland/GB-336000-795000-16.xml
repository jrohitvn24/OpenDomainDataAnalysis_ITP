		<title>16COUNTRYSIDE AROUND BALLATER</title>
		<content> The land around Ballater is a mixture 
 of rich farm land and plantations of  
 Scots Pine trees.  The hills of Craig 
 Coillich and Craigendarroch provide   
 magnificent views of the surrounding  
 area. Roe deer, red squirrels, foxes, 
 badgers and other Scottish highland   
 wildlife can be found among the pine, 
 larch, oak and birchwoods. Bird life  
 abounds in and around Ballater ranging
 from buzzards and other birds of prey 
 to the more domesticated chaffinch and
 robin. Sheep are kept on rough grazing
 on higher ground. In the winter the   
 local estate workers feed the red deer
 The once famous spa of Pannanich Wells
 overlooks the ruined church of Tullich
 which is now surrounded by grazing    
 cattle. A field of barley conceals an 
 ancient earth-house or soutterain. The
 area is dominated by the River Dee    
 with its salmon fishing pools.        </content>
