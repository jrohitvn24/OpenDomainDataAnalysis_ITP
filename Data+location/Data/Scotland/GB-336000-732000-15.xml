		<title>15Traffic in and out</title>
		<content> We carried out a census of traffic on 
 the Kingsway, a dual carriageway      
 running from east to west on the      
 outskirts of Dundee and passing       
 through our area of study. We watched 
 the traffic at the junction with      
 Coupar Angus Road. Of the traffic     
 travelling north on the Coupar Angus  
 Road the most common vehicle was the  
 car. We felt that most of the         
 travellers would be heading for       
 Blairgowrie or Alyth or perhaps to    
 some of the smaller villages on the   
 way.Of the traffic heading south,     
 again the majority were cars, and we  
 thought they were probably heading    
 into Dundee for work or shopping. What
 vans we saw were either Post Office   
 vans delivering letters and parcels,  
 or Securicor vans which patrol the    
 factories in the area.
