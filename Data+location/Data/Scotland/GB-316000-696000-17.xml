		<title>17Vandalism in Ballingry</title>
		<content>  There is a very high incidence of    
{VANDALISM}in Ballingry. There isn't a 
 public telephone in use.{GRAFFITI}is  
 sprayed and painted over walls by     
 thoughtless and inconsiderate people, 
 and lamp-posts are damaged. Vandalism 
 is closing down shops because windows 
 are broken and shop-keepers cannot    
 afford to replace them. The store     
 (CO-OP) windows have been boarded up. 
  Some teenagers hang about the chip   
 shop waiting till nightfall to destroy
 other people's property. In the park  
 they damage the swings and chutes and 
 deface them with paint. The Council   
 has to board up empty houses because  
 mindless vandals break the windows.   
  At one time, people may have tried to
 deter them, but they have just given  
 up and now there is evidence of       
 vandalism everywhere.
