		<content> The deep glaciated valley of Glen     
 Finart runs south east to the shores  
 og Loch Long.   Steep mountains rise  
 on either side of the alluvial flats  
 of the glen, composed of schhistose   
 rocks.   Land use reflects the high   
 rainfall.   The hillsides up to 300   
 metres are largely planted with       
 conifers with rough hill grazing      
 above.   The valley bottom is poorly  
 drained and is predominantly used for 
 grazing sheep and cattle.   From lower
 Glen Finart the scattered village of  
 Ardentinny spreads south along the    
 shore of Loch Long.   The main sources
 of employment for inhabitants are the 
 outdoor education centre, the hotel   
 and forestry.   Many of the village   
 houses are holiday homes or occupied  
 by Donoon commuters.   Ardenntinny    
 functions as a small tourist resort,  
 having two beaches, a bowling club,   </content>
