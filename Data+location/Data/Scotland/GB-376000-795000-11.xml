		<title>11Fashion in Durris</title>
		<content> A lot of the North Eastern people are 
 not really fashionable but some       
 are.People up here dress for the      
 weather,for the country,or just for   
 comfort.About 90% of the people in our
 block dress in plain clothes and 10%  
 fashionably.The plain clothes are a   
 dull colour.It doesn't make any       
 difference to your clothes if you have
 money or not.Most of the children     
 dress in fashion more than the        
 adults.The children's fashion is      
 trousers with elastic in the          
 bottom,baggy clothes and jeans.Adult  
 fashion is jump suits and floral      
 prints.Fashion clothes come from big  
 stores in Aberdeen.Many people in     
 Durris are farmers so they wear stuff 
 that they can move about in and work  
 in.Most people have their hair combed 
 straight down.Others have curly hair. 
 Short hair is in fashion now.         </content>
