		<title>01Western Part of Peterculter.</title>
		<content> This is a rural area, only one cormner
 (part of Peterculter) being urban.  In
 that corner was a centuries - old     
 paper mill which was the start of the 
 village.  The mill closed 5 years ago,
 and the site is being turned to       
 private housing.  Next to the road    
 bridge is a wooden statue of Rob Roy, 
 and opposite, the war memorial.       
 Within the block lie a roman          
 marching-camp, covered by forestry,   
 and the ancient ruined Kirk of Dalmalk
 on its beautiful riverside site.  The 
 old line of the railway to Ballater   
 passes through the block as do the    
 main roads north and south of the     
 river.  Since 1975 Culter (the short  
 local name) has been part of Aberdeen 
 city, but has so far retained its     
 village character, and has active     
 community organisations.
