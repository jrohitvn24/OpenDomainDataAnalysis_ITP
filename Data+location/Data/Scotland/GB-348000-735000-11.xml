		<title>11QUARRY</title>
		<content> Apart from the farms, the only other  
 employer of any importance in our area
 is the local quarry. Based on the plug
 of an extinct volcano, the stone      
 quarried is whinstone, a hard, black  
 stone which is crushed to make chips  
 for road metal. Some 6 men in the     
 village of Newbigging, and a further 4
 from the village of Wellbank find     
 employment there. The site extends to 
 some 14 acres, and with only 6 years  
 of its lease to run, there is         
 speculation locally as to what will   
 happen to the site when quarrying     
 ceases. Being close to Dundee, the    
 large hole created would be a prime   
 site for dumping waste of all sorts,  
 and some concern has been expressed   
 about this locally. At the moment,    
 there is little pollution from the    
 quarry, either in the form of noise,  
 dust or heavy traffic.                </content>
