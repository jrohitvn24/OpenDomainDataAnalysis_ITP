		<title>16FARMING IN THE WINTER</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
  A typical farmer would get up around 
 7 o'clock a.m. in the winter; maybe   
 later if he has had a cow calving     
 during the night  which often happens 
 at this time of the year.The first    
 thing he does is to feed the cows     
 (which are in the barn) with oats     
 then either hay or silage.            
  Then depending on whether or not the 
 cows are in a slatted byre (where the 
 muck drains through on its own) he    
 might have to clean out. This can be a
 long job which has to be done twice a 
 day. The farmer has to get up two or  
 three times a night to check that     
 there are no cows  calving.           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
