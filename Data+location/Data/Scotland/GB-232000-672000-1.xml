		<content> Port Glasgow is located on the banks  
 of the River Clyde. To the west of the
 town lies the larger town of Greenock 
 and Gourock. To the east is open      
 countryside and the small village of  
 Langbank. The{landscape}to the south  
 of the town is relatively flat in     
 comparison to the raised beach        
 landscape on which the town is built. 
  {Communications}with the surrounding 
 area are generally found along the    
 flat land on the banks of the river.  
 It has been the river which has proved
 to be the catalyst for the growth of  
 the town. With the decline in the     
 traditional industries of shipbuilding
 and marine engineering the town has   
{employment}problems and the resultant 
 problems have given rise to a variety 
 of{social concerns.
