 to write about their hobbies. Derek

 'My hobby is orienteering. I go every 
 Thursday evening to Camphill High     
 School to do it. You need a whistle,  
 a pen, a compass and a map to be able 
 to do orienteering. The object of the 
 sport is to find your way between two 
 places on a map. The compass is used  
 to make sure that you can find the    
 direction from one point to another,  
 the pen is used to mark the route you 
 should take on the map to get from one
 point to another. The whistle is a    
 very important piece of equipment for 
 orienteering. If you get lost you have
 to use the whistle to summon help.    
 You should not get lost because to go 
 orienteering you must first do a basic
 course in using a compass and reading 
 a map.                                </content>
