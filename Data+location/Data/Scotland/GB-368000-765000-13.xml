		<content>    The senior citizens have seen many 
 changes in the village.  New houses   
 and a new school have been built      
 during the past 20 years.  An indoor  
 bowling club was formed about three   
 years ago. There used to be 3 Sunday  
 School teachers and the Church had    
 more regular attenders.  Marymill and 
 Balmanno Farms provided milk for the  
 village and there used to be weekly   
 dances in the hall.                   
    In the future, they would like to  
 see more people at Church and lots    
 more community spirit.  There should  
 be more for the younger people such as
 a tennis court and perhaps a bowling  
 green for the older generation.  Most 
 people like the village as it is.
