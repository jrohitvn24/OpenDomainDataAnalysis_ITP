		<title>15Aboyne Highland Games</title>
		<content> The Aboyne Highland Games is an annual
 event held on the first weekend of    
 August each year.  The event takes    
 place on the local green situated in  
 the centre of Aboyne and is a great   
 social gathering with people from all 
 around the area coming to watch and   
 take part.  The Games have been held  
 for many years and are the main event 
 in Aboyne's social calendar.  The     
{events}include{traditional sports}such
 as tossing the caber and the hill     
 race.  There is provision for         
 organisations to set up stalls around 
 the area and many people take         
 advantage of this for fund raising.   
 The shops get good{trade}on the day   
 but the overall effect is minimal.    
 The main{entertainment}is the marquee 
 dance and disco held in the evening   
 and the Fair that takes place on the  
 Friday night and during Saturday.     </content>
