      {THE OPENING}                    
      The factory was opened in 1969 by
 Her Majesty The Queen accompanied by  
 The Duke of Edinburgh and Princess    
 Anne.                                 
      {THE WORKFORCE}                  
      All the garments, except for     
 samples are made by out-workers in    
 their own homes. The garments are     
 taken to the factory for washing and  
 dressing. The final process is the    
 brushing of the garments to raise the 
 pile.                                 
      {FASHION COLOURS}                
      This year the fashionable colours
 are bright ones, such as scarlet,     
 emerald green and yellow.             </content>
