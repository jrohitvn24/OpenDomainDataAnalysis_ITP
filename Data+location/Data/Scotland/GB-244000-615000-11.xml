		<title>11HISTORY OF LITTLEMILL SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Littlemill was originally a junior    
 secondary with 9 classes.Various      
 specialist teachers visited the school
 to teach the children subjects such as
 woodwork and cookery.The school was   
 also used for performing marriages and
 holding dances and whist drives.We    
 also found out that the main school   
 building burned down in January 1955. 
 The pupils were farmed out to local   
 schools while Littlemill School was   
 being rebuilt.It was November before  
 all the classes were back in their own
 school.Littlemill children were again 
 moved out of their school in 1969.    
 Cracks due to subsidence had appeared.
 Since the Aberfan disaster had just   
 occured it was thought that it would  
 be safer for the children to be       
 temporarily taught in Drongan primary 
 school while the work of shoring up   
 the school took place.                </content>
