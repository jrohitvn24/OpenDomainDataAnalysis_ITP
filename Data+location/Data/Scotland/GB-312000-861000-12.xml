		<title>12TODAYS TOYS</title>
		<content> Many of the toys today are very modern
 such as Action Man, Technic Lego,     
 Scalectrix and battery powered models 
 like Stompers, Tri-ex and Rough       
 Riders.                               
 Technic Lego is a construction toy    
 with details like pistons,            
 differentials and fans. You can also  
 fit motors to make models work. The   
 pistons work too, they go up and down 
 or in and out. Some of the models you 
 can make are a breakdown truck, a     
 tractor, a forklift and a car chassis.
 The Rough Riders are battery powered  
 models of cars and motorbikes. They   
 move quite quickly so you have to walk
 to keep up with them.                 
 Tri-ex is like Rough Riders but it has
 gears and can be changed from two     
 wheel drive to four wheel drive.
