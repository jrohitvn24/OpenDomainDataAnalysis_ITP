		<content> Achareidh is the biggest housing      
 estate in Nairn and the houses are    
 fairly new compared with the other    
 housing estates in Nairn.             
 The estate got its name because it was
 built in a large field and was the    
 name of the local farm. Achareidh     
 is Gaelic for large field.            
 Most of the houses were built from    
 1972_1974.                            
 Just over 90% of the houses are       
 detatched and only a few are semi_    
 detatched.Most of the houses have 9   
 rooms,but a big proportion have 5 and 
 6 rooms.The average household has 4   
 people in a family ,but there are a   
 few pensioners and young couples.     
 Of the people we surveyed,most people 
 in our area go to karate &amp; swimming   
 for a hobby,but a lot of elderly women
 do knitting.
