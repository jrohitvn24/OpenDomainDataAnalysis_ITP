		<title>13OAP view of Fintry</title>
		<content> As a girl I lived in a cottage in Old 
 Fintry, by Denny road junction - it's 
 gone now. The school there had closed 
 and we walked the unmetalled road to  
 Fintry Cross where the new one was.   
 I've lived all my life here, for many 
 years in the Main Street and now in   
 this council house.                   
 You never locked your door, people    
 just came and went. Life is easier, we
 have electricity and good roads, but  
{there used to be more buses on them,  
{four a day sometimes.}The sanitation  
 scheme is a blessing too, though we   
 lived for years without it. Tv's good 
 entertainment: we made our own - folk 
 can't seem to now.     We were never  
 bored, never knew the meaning of the  
 word. Life was simpler, fewer people  
 then, and you knew everyone, but there
 is no going back. I'd feel happier    
 with our own bobby living here though.</content>
