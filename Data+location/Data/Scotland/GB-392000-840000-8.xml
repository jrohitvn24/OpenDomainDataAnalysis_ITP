 Meryl Donald is a really nice lady    
 she is very kind and helpful she lives
 next to the post office and she is    
 very patient and she takes a joke.    
 We interviewed her because she knows  
 all the people in the village and she 
 has lived here a long time.           
{q.1How long have you lived in         
{Auchnagatt?                           
 I have lived here all my life which is
 57 years.                             
{q.2has Auchnagatt changed a lot?      
 The railway is gone now and the bus   
 service is down to two buses per day  
 2 into Aberdeen and 2 from Aberdeen   
{q.3How has it changed?} as I say the  
 railway gone and it was used a lot.You
 see when we were kids we had to go to 
 1 school that was Maud and we used the
 train every day so the train is a big 
 miss.(CONT.ON PAGE 9)                 </content>
