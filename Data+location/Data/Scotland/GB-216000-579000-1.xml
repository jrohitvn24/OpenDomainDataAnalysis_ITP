		<title>01Aregleoch Forest Main Block</title>
		<content> This whole area is totally afforested 
 and contains forest from just newly   
 planted up to planted  in 1958. Sqs 1 
 &amp; 5 are privately owned the rest being
 owned by the forest Commission.  This 
 area contains some of the richest     
 ground in the whole forest for        
 afforestation and some of te most     
 sheltered.  The area slso contains an 
 ancient Bronze age village which has  
 been left undestrubed and has been    
 fenced off and a site of special      
 scientific interest.  Once again the  
 area could be described as glacial    
 upland topography having a very       
 reasonably fertile peaty grey soil    
 type.  The area is quite exposed      
 although the ground in and around the 
 ancient village is sheltered and      
 contains the best and richest soils of
 the whole forest. The village can be  
 found in centre of Sq 7.              </content>
