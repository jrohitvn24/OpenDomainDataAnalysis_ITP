		<content> In the commercial centre there is a   
 bank and a building society. The bank 
 is a branch of the Royal Bank of      
 Scotland. It is only a temporary      
 construction - a portacabin type grey 
 hut. It may not be very attractive    
 from the outside but it does good     
 business because it is the only bank  
 in the town. The branch is small and  
 only caters for clients wishing to    
 deposit and withdraw money. It does   
 not deal with foreign currency        
 transactions. For that service        
 customers have to go to the larger    
 branches in Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy or 
 Edinburgh. The building society is a  
 branch of the Halifax which has in the
 last few years lost a number of       
 accounts to a rival society in the new
 shopping centre to the west.
