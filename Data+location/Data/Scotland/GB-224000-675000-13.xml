		<content> GOUROCK IS NOT AN INDUSTRIAL TOWN,BUT 
 IT HAS SOME INDUSTRY. ONE EXAMPLE IS  
 ADAMS BOATYARD WHICH REPAIRS SHIPS FOR
 THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE. ADAMS GET    
 ABOUT TWO BOATS A MONTH TO REPAIR.    
 THEY DO NOT BUILD SHIPS ANY LONGER BUT
 BUILD STEEL STRUCTURES.               
  NATIONAL SEMI CONDUCTORS IS A        
 RELATIVELY NEW INDUSTRY TO THE        
 AREA,WHICH MAKES SEMI CONDUCTORS FOR  
 IBM AND THE POST OFFICE. THE COMPANY  
 IS OF AMERICAN ORIGIN.THIS IS THE     
 FIRMS ONLY SCOTTISH PLANT WHICH       
 EMPLOYS AROUND 1600 PEOPLE.IN THE PAST
 FEW WEEKS MANY HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS   
 DUE TO A SLUMP IN THE MARKET FOR THE  
 PRODUCT. AT THE EASTERN END OF THE    
 AREA IS TATE AND LYLE'S WESTBURN SUGAR
 REFINERY. THIS IS THE ONLY REFINERY   
 LEFT IN GREENOCK AND OWES ITS ORIGINS 
 TO EARLY TRADE WITH THE AMERICAS.
