		<title>18Home Life in Alford</title>
		<content> A feature of life in the 80s is that  
 it is now quite usual for both husband
 and wife to work. Shopping habits have
 changed. In the past  rural areas were
 served by every imaginable type of    
 travelling" shoppie". Now very few    
 exist. The deep freeze is common place
 and many bulk-buy groceries locally or
 in supermarkets in Aberdeen or Dyce. A
 wide range of fruit and vegetables are
 bought to augment garden produce.     
 People prefer leaner meat bought from 
 the local butcher. Locally made cheese
 and butter can still be bought.       
 Oatmeal, once the staple diet, is     
 still widely used in porridge, oat-   
 cakes, haggis and mealy puddings.     
 These served with minced  beef  and   
 tatties are a  popular meal.
