		<content> In 1715,after the battle of           
 Sherriffmuir,Rob Roy invaded the      
 countryside around Falkland and with  
 his soldiers took over Falkland       
 Palace. One of the most beautiful     
 girls in the area was Jenny Nettles.  
 One of Rob Roy's officers fell in     
 love with her.When the time came      
 for Rob Roy and his men to leave,the  
 young officer deserted Jenny.Poor     
 Jenny was broken hearted.She couldn't 
 bear to live any longer so she        
 committed suicide and was found       
 hanging on a roadside tree between    
 Falkland and Strathmiglo.Because she  
 had committed suicide she couldn't be 
 buried in the local graveyard,she     
 could not even be put in a coffin, and
 sometime in the night she was buried  
 on Barrington Moor.It is said that on 
 moonlight nights,Jenny wanders over   
 the moors searching for her lost love.</content>
