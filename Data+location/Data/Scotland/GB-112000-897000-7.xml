		<title>07FARMING IN HARRIS</title>
		<content> In Harris there are no farms such as  
 those existing on the mainland.Instead
 agricultural land is divided into     
 crofts.The average croft is 8         
 hectares.The Crofters'Commission is   
 the body which administers the laws   
 concerning crofts.A recent development
 offering financial aid for croft      
 improvements is the Integrated        
 Development Programme(IDP)Crofters    
 usually keep sheep.Some also keep     
 cattle.Most of the hay for winter     
 feeding is grown on the croft.Root    
 crops,especially potatoes,are also    
 grown.As the land is so hilly,most    
 work is done by hand.Another crop     
 produced in the area is fish. Salmon  
 and trout are reared on fish farms for
 sale to mainland markets. Shellfish   
 farming,mainly mussels,takes place in 
 sheltered bays.Clams(Scallops)are also
 harvested from inshore waters.        </content>
