		<content> I carried out a survey of the farms in
 our school's block since 75% of our   
 area is farmland.                     
 The main crop is grass which is used  
 for grazing cattle and sheep.Some of  
 the grass is cut to make hay or       
 silage.                               
 Barley is commonly grown as are       
 vegetables like potatoes.             
 Many of the farms keep animals.Cows   
 are kept for dairying.Sheep are common
 and one farmer rears calves.One farmer
 keeps two goats from which he         
 gets milk.                            
 Some of the land nearest The Solway   
 shore is rough grazing land and is    
 used to keep horses.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
