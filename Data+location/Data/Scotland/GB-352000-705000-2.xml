		<title>02KELLIE CASTLE</title>
		<content>                                       
 The oldest part of the castle is      
 believed to date from about 1360. The 
 building mainly 16 and 17 century.    
 Probably assumed its present dimension
 about 1606. Kellie is a very fine     
 example of the domestic architecture  
 of Lowland Scotland.  Many of the     
 internal fittings and features,e.g.   
 the plastic work and panelling painted
 with "romantic" landscapes, are       
 excellent examples of the period. The 
 'chief messuage' of the Seward or     
 Siward family at the end of the 13    
 century.  Kellie was resigned to the  
 Oliphants with whom it remains for    
 over 250 years before being sold in   
 1613 to Thomas Erskine, who became    
 first Earl of Kellie. Virtually       
 abandoned in the early 19 century. The
 castle was leased to, and restored by 
 Professor James Lorimer.              </content>
