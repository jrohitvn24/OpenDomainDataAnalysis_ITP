 The Coastal Protection Act was first  
 instituted in 1949, making the        
 Regional Councils responsible for the 
 unkeep of areas experiencing coastal  
 erosion other than privately owned    
 land by the coast which has to be kept
 in repair by the person who owns the  
 property. On cliff areas a concrete   
 wall is usually constructed at the    
 base of the cliff, thus preventing the
 powerful waves from eroding and       
 undercutting the cliffs. These walls  
 must withstand the force of the waves,
 thus, when they are constructed, they 
 are reinforced by steel bars. Where   
 erosion is more serious, rocks are    
 piled between the wall and the cliffs,
 giving added protection. The upper    
 part of the cliff can be stabilised by
 pinning seed-impregnated netting over 
 the softer unconsolidated surface.    </content>
