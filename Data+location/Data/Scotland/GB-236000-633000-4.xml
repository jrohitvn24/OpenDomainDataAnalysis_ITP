  On Tuesday of this week plans were   
 put forward to turn part of the now   
 disused Monsanto Nylon factory into a 
 home for elderly people.              
  Local teenagers can now look forward 
 to a new Youth Club organised for them
 in the Church Hall each week.         
  Prestwick Air Show was held on       
 Saturday and many local people went to
 see and enjoy the many attractions.   
 Those who did not had a good view of  
 the many strange aircraft as they flew
 to and from the Show.                 
  Finally, local people are looking    
 forward to the Annual Fete when many  
 events will take place, including the 
 crowning of the Queen,judging of      
 best-dressed pram and bicycle,        
 five-a-side football and many more    
 attractions.
