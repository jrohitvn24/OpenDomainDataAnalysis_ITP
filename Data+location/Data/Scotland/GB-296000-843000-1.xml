		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW OF FERNESS</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
                                       
   The village of Ferness is included  
 in our grid. It lies by the crossroads
 of the Nairn to Grantown and Forres to
 Carrbridge roads ( A &amp; B roads        
 respectively.) It is a rural community
 having approx. 10 houses, a garage and
 sub post office in the immediate area 
 but with many small farms and a small 
 number of houses nearby. The principal
 part of the grid consists of grouse   
 moor with several large patches of    
 forest situated nearer to the roads.  
   The River Findhorn cuts through one 
 corner flowing north on its way to the
 Moray Firth. The lowest point on the  
 grid is by the river - 125m. The      
 village lies at about 200m and the    
 highest point is 275m on the grouse   
 moor.                                 </content>
