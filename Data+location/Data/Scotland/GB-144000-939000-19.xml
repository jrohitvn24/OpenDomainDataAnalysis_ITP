 Because Lewis is situated at the edge 
 of the North Atlantic, any frontal    
 systems and low pressure areas from   
 the west tend to hit the island first.
 This happens frequently.              
{TYPES OF WEATHER}                     
 Lewis has an extreme western maritime 
 climate.This means that the weather is
 generally wet with strong winds,often 
 gale force.During the summer there are
 usually hot dry spells but these are  
 not consistant.There is usually snow  
 in winter but it doesn't last long    
 thanks to the warmth in the Gulf      
 Stream.                               
{THE WEATHER'S EFFECT}                 
 Islanders worry about the weather.It  
 is important that the weather is warm 
 and dry as in spring lambs are being  
 born and peat has to be cut,dried and 
 taken home.                           </content>
