		<title>11Houses</title>
		<content> The houses are mostly farm cottages   
 built out of stone but few more modern
 houses are built out of brick  with   
 harled walls.Nearly evey single one is
 roofed with red pan tiles but the     
 occasional house has grey             
 slates.Almost all the farm cottages   
 are built in rows but most of the     
 modern houses ar detached vilas.The   
 farm cottages are single storey but   
 the farm houses,private houses and    
 council houses have two storeys.Farm  
 cottages mostly have  a kitchen, a    
 living room,a bathroom and two or     
 three bedrooms while the private      
 houses,farm houses, and council       
 houses have a living room,a           
 bathroom,a few bedrooms, a dining room
 and a utility room.The modern houses  
 have gardens right round them while   
 most of the farm cottages have their  
 gardens at the back of the house.     </content>
