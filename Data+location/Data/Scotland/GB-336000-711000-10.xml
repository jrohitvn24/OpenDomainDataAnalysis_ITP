		<title>10VILLAGE LIFE IN THE 1900'S.</title>
		<content> We visited an elderly gentleman who   
 came to Ceres in l909 when he was only
 2 years old.In l912 he started Ceres  
 Primary then he went to Bell Baxter   
 which at that time was feepaying. He  
 left school when he was 16. In l939 he
 and a friend took over Charles Smith &amp;
 Son which was an Ironmonger, Newsagent
 &amp; Grocer's business.He was the only   
 newsagent in the village,and today    
 there is still only one newsagent but 
 in those days he used to have about 20
 dozen 'Couriers' delivered each       
 morning.                              
 He also did a thriving business in    
 blended whisky which he sent to the   
 North of England.People used to come  
 from towns and villages all around to 
 shop in Ceres and some used to push   
 their messages home in a wheelbarrow.
