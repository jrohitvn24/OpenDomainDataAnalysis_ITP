		<content>{ "To be a school at the heart of it's 
{community"}is the declared aim of     
 Kennoway Primary School.              
  Working together, the{School and the 
{Parent's Association}have forged links
 of partnership and through shared     
 experiences both within the school day
 and in extra-currricular activities,  
 sound school/home relations now exist.
  The Association works hard to promote
 home/school relations in a variety of 
 ways; in running a weekly coffee      
 morning and thrift shop; in organising
 various social events and raising     
 funds and in promoting craft          
 activities in the middle school.      
  The commitment of the parents and the
 school has brought about a new sense  
 of vigour and vitality in the daily   
 life of the school. Both parties      
 realise that these relations, now in  
 existence, must be nurtured.          </content>
