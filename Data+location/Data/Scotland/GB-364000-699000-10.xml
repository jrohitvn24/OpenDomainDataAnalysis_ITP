		<content> in 1956 the Isle of May was declared a
 National Nature Reserve (N.N.R.) by an
 agreement with the owners (The        
 Northern Lighthouse Board) and the    
 Nature Conservancy Council            
 (N.C.C.),the government body          
 responsible for wildlife conservation 
 in Britain. The island is of national 
 importance for its nesting colonies of
 seabirds, and for its unique position 
 on the main east coast migration      
 route. Its status as an NNR means that
 it is scientifically managed to       
 maintain its wildlife intrest. Much   
 research is done by St Andrews and    
 other Universities and the observatory
 is maned for most of the year by      
 amateur ornathologists. The NCC       
 station a warden on the island during 
 the summer to carry out managemant    
 work and control day visitors who come
 out from Anstruther and Crail.        </content>
