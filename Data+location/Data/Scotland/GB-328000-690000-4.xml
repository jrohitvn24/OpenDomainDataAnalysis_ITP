		<content> PAN HA' is owned by the National Trust
 who took it over in 1968. The houses  
 were in ruins and numbers two to six  
 were completely rebuilt.  The         
 completed project was opened by the   
 Queen Mother (Elizabeth - consort of  
 George VI) in 1969.                   
 Pan Ha' consists of twelve houses in a
 row with another house stepped back   
 from them. It is split into two flats 
 and has a date on it - 1582. Its name 
 is 'The Anchorage'. Pan Ha' gets its  
 name from the salt pans that were used
 for making salt in the area. Ha' comes
 from haugh meaning a flat piece of    
 land beside the sea, which Pan Ha' is.
 The houses are white with crow stepped
 gables and the new houses have bigger 
 windows than the old. The first house,
 which used to be a wash house, is so  
 old that its door is more than a meter
 below present ground level.           </content>
