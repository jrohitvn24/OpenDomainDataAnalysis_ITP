		<title>10RURAL LIFE</title>
		<content>   In this block there are no          
 restaurants, hotels or cafes and      
 people wishing these facilities have  
 to travel to Inverness. The children  
 in the school (and most parents)      
 didn't feel that these things were    
 essential and that their quality of   
 life was enhanced by living in the    
 country. None of the children thought 
 they would prefer to live in a town   
 or city, the reasons being it was less
 healthy and more dangerous (road      
 accidents). Most children enjoyed the 
 freedom of having plenty of space to  
 play and had in fact spent most of    
 their lives in a rural area. It was   
 thought that as they got older they   
 may wish to spend more time in        
 Inverness, and that this could be a   
 problem due to the lack of public     
 transport.
