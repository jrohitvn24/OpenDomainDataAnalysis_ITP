		<title>03Kirkton Farm.</title>
		<content> Mr Hamilton came to Kirkton Farm 24   
 years ago.He owns 750 acres of land.  
 Most of the land is stock and hill    
 land and the rest is arable.Mr        
 Hamilton says that to be a good farmer
 you need to be a good stockman.       
 On Mr Hamilton's farm,over the last   
 ten years,he has reclaimed more ground
 which gives him more arable and stock 
 land.Mr Hamilton owns Aberdeen Angus  
 cross cattle and Black-face sheep,some
 of which are cross bred and some pure 
 bred.Mr Hamilton's crops  are good    
 this year although they have not been 
 harvested yet.                        
 Next to Kirkton Farm house is a       
 graveyard.It was probably the first   
 graveyard in Crawford.It was first    
 used in 1621 and the last burial was  
 in 1940.
