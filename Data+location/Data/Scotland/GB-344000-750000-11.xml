		<title>11LOCAL HISTORY OF FORFAR</title>
		<content> Another of the local{monuments}is {   
{Balmashanner}and is known in Forfar as
 'Bummy'.It was built for all the      
 soldiers from Forfar who fell in World
 War 1.Every year on Remembrance Day,  
 old soldiers and relations of ones who
 died go to Bummy to lay wreaths and   
 remember their loved ones.            
 Just about 100 metres away from the   
 monument is a small gulley. During    
 World War 2 a British Spitfire was    
 chasing a German bomber. The bomb in  
 the German plane was slowing it down  
 so the Germans dropped it in the      
 gulley to get away.That is the only   
 bomb to have dropped on Forfar in the 
 whole war.It didn't hurt anybody!
