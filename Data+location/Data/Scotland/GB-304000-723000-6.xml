		<content> Tibbermore village is at a crossroads 
 four and three quarter miles west of  
 Perth centre. Today there are nine    
 houses but no shops. The stone built  
 school is empty and and deserted since
 1979. Evidence remains of a stone     
 fireplace, arched windows and iron    
 ventilators in its three classrooms.  
 Tibbermore church, originally built in
 1631, extended in 1841 for millworkers
 from Ruthvenfield Mill, is also       
 closed. The last service was held on  
 September 9th. 1984. Inside a slate   
 memorial stone dated 1632 to Sir James
 Murray and his family is built into   
 the wall. Some wooden pews have little
 doors with locks. Two galleries, east 
 and west, are reached by stairs.      
 Stained glass windows show Jesus      
 baptised by John the Baptist and Queen
 Margaret.
