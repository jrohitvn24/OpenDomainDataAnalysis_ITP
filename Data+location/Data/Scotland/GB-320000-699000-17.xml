		<title>17LEVEN VALLEY POLLUTION</title>
		<content> MOST LITTER IS DROPPED BY PEOPLE FROM 
 CARS THEREFORE WE SURVEYED POLLUTION  
 ALONG THE MAIN ROADS.OUR MAIN         
 OBSERVATION WAS THAT MOST POLLUTION   
 OCCURRED WHERE ROADS WERE STEEPEST AND
 CARS WOULD SLOW DOWN.                 
  TWO MAIN TYPES OF POLLUTION EXIST.   
 FIRST,PEOPLE DELIBERATELY DUMPING A   
 LOAD OF RUBBISH.THE BEST EXAMPLE OF   
 THIS WAS AN OLD DISUSED QUARRY WHICH  
 HAD BEEN LANDSCAPED TO IMPROVE THE    
 ENVIRONMENT.HOWEVER PEOPLE HAVE DUMPED
 RUBBISH LIKE CANS,CERAMIC TILES AND   
 FULL POLYTHENE BAGS WHICH HAVE BURST. 
  AN EXAMPLE OF THE OTHER POLLUTION WAS
 IN THE ROAD WEST FROM LESLIE.THER WE  
 NOTICED DROPPED FROM MOVING CARS THERE
 WERE MANY EMBASSY REGAL CIGARETTE     
 PACKETS AND PAPER.THESE ARE           
 BIODEGRADEABLE WHEREAS POLYTHENE,COKE 
 CANS,PLASTIC BOTTLES AND FOIL DISHES  
 FROM CARRYOUT MEALS ARE NOT.          </content>
