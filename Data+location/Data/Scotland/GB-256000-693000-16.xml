 the{3 teachers,}who are helped by

 remedial work, craft and physical     
 education.

 work at mathematics in his own        
 workbook, write a story in his best   
 handwriting, find out about some past 
 event from books, paint his           
 contribution to a class picture or    
 model, and join his class-mates to    
 learn a new song and watch a schools' 
 television programme.
