		<content>   Health services in Golspie and the  
 surrounding area are provided by the {
{Highland Health Board.}               
   The local population are seved by   
 the local{health centre}which is      
 staffed by two general practioners and
 a health visitor.                     
   Golspie also has the only surgical  
{hospital}in Sutherland,with a resident
 surgeon.This hospital deals with minor
 surgery and acts as an out-patients   
 clinic for various consultants who    
 travel north from Inverness on a      
 regular basis.                        
   All major hospital care is now      
 centred in the new Raigmore Hospital  
 in Inverness,60 miles away where most 
 hospitalisation takes place.Although  
 most people welcome the facilities in 
 Inverness,they regret that relatives  
 and friends in hospital are so far    
 away from their homes.                </content>
