		<title>04SHOPPING</title>
		<content> We interviewed 131 people about their 
 shopping patterns. 104 did their basic
 shopping in a supermarket outside the 
 village, the rest locally. Most people
 bought milk locally and many bought   
 meat,bakery goods,confectionery and   
 fruit and vegetables in the village.  
 We asked the local shopkeepers what   
 sold best and here are some of the    
 answers.In the bakers most people     
 still bought white bread although many
 bought health loaves.Our favourite    
 cake is a pineapple one which has     
 icing,cream,pineapple and pastry      
 yum!The children's favourite comics   
 were Dandy,Playhour and Bunty.The     
 Glasgow Herald and Daily Record the   
 most popular papers and most of our   
 mothers bought Womans Own,Woman's     
 Weekly or Peoples Friend.
