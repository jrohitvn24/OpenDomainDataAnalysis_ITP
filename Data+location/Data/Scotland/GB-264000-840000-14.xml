		<content>    Pupils who attend the I.R.A. come  
 mainly from 4 primary schools in      
 Inverness and country schools as far  
 south as{WHITEBRIDGE}and{FOYERS.}     
 Altogether with pupils, staff and     
 auxiliary workers about 2000 people   
 are involved in the day to day        
 business of the school.               
    Apart from the normal curriculum   
 the Academy has lots of clubs and     
 activities.There are football,        
 rugby,hockey and shinty teams. There  
 is ski_ing, orienteering, athletics   
 and curling for the sports_minded and 
 computer, chess, drama and dance for  
 children who prefer less strenuous    
 activities.                           
    Going to a large comprehensive can 
 be, particularly for the country      
 children, a frightening experience but
 the majority end up happy and secure  
 in the school.                        </content>
