		<content>{Duddingston Loch}was formed 10,000    
 years ago after the last Ice Age. In  
 1923 it was given to the nation as a  
{Bird Sanctuary.}The Scottish Wildlife 
 Trust purchased the neighbouring      
{Bawsinch Nature Reserve}in 1971 to    
 protect wildlife habitats.            
{ Reed beds}have encroached on the     
 water; other plants have grown on the 
 rotting vegetation, and, as a result  
 of natural succession, trees such as  
 hawthorn have flourished. Eventually a
{Climax Woodland}of oak and ash will be
 reached.                              
  The Loch is famous for both{breeding 
{and wintering wildfowl.}Greylag geese,
 pochard and coot may be observed.     
 There are 33 species of trees which   
 provide shelter for birds and mammals.
 Several small ponds have been created 
 to provide habitats for water plants  
 and insect larvae such as damsel fly. </content>
