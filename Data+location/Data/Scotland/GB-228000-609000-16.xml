		<content>{THE CASTLE}was built around 1560 by   
 the Earl of Cassilis as his town      
 residence. In the traditional Scottish
 baronial style it had a square tower  
 with round turrets and extended across
 the modern main street_the finest of  
 the 28 lairds' houses described in    
 1686 by the writer Abercrummie. A     
 lovely little oriel window overlooks  
 the high street from the room in which
 one of the countesses was imprisoned  
 after running off with the gypsy chief
 Johnny Faa_according to romantic local
 legend.                               
{THE OLD COLLEGE}was built on the site 
 of the parish church of St. Cuthbert  
 granted to the Cistercian nunnery of  
 N.Berwick by Earl Duncan in 1216. The 
 more  recent building dates from 1371 
 as a chapel and from 1441 as a        
 Collegiate church.
