		<title>07HOUSING IN PORT GLASGOW</title>
		<content> Most of the{housing}stock in Port     
 Glasgow can be divided into four      
 categories.These are (1)District      
 Council Housing,(2)Scottish Special   
 Association Housing,(3)Owner Occupied,
 and (4)Privately Rented Houses.       
     The houses in Port Glasgow vary in
 age and design.A lot of the older     
 houses are tenements which are 30 or  
 more years old.These are tall and     
 contain many individual flats.Newer   
 styles of semi-detached ,terraced and 
 maisonette housing can be found.      
    Many of the oldest houses need a   
 lot of repairs.Most of these buildings
 have had to undergo drastic repair    
 work and some have just been knocked  
 down to make way for new buildings.
