		<title>02SECONDARY SCHOOL IN N.S.</title>
		<content>   Newton Stewart has three schools    
 and nearby Minnigaff,one.The secondary
 is the{Douglas Ewart High School,}    
 which is one of only two secondary    
 schools in Wigtown District.It has    
 over nine_hundred pupils,many         
 travelling in daily from a wide area  
 around.                               
   Before the 1920's the{Douglas}and   
 the{Ewart}were two separate schools.  
 Samuel Douglas left Â£17000 to build a 
 school which opened in 1834 as the    
 Douglas Free School.                  
   Later the Ewart family appointed    
 trustees who found land to build a    
 free school,and a High_School for     
 fee_payers.Both were completed in     
 1864.In 1923 both schools,having      
 financial difficulties,were united    
 under one name,Douglas Ewart High     
 School and transferred to Wigtown     
 County Council.                       </content>
