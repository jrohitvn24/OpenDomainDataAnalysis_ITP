   Blackridge is on the original       
{Edinburgh}to{Glasgow}coach road.      
 Parts of the tracks that ran from     
{Armadale}to{Blackridge}are covered    
 with red ash.                         
             ..............            
                                       
   At the west towards Glasgow there is
 moss called{Blawhorn Moss. }Blawhorn  
 Moss got its name when coach drivers  
 blew a horn to tell the people at the 
 Craig Inn they were coming.  The      
 tracks are at the back of the school. 
             ..............            
                                       
   At the {Craig Inn }the coach stopped
 and the horses changed because they   
 were tired.  Most of the stables were 
 knocked down and others have          
 machinery  in them.                   </content>
