		<title>02Employment in Balmullo Area</title>
		<content> The area which we have studied is     
 mainly agricultural land.  Much of it 
 is arable land and some is used as    
 pasture for cattle and sheep.         
 However, a large area is used for     
 growing fruit, particularly           
 raspberries and strawberries.   This  
 is one of the things for which        
 Balmullo is best known locally.   In  
 fact, at one time there were 27 market
 gardens in and around the village!    
 Now there is only one, but local farms
 grow fruit on a large scale.          
                                       
 The only industry in the village takes
 place at the Quarry and the Smithy.   
 Thus most employment for those who are
 not involved in farming is at R.A.F.  
 Leuchars or in towns within travelling
 distance.   However, some residents   
 work further afield e.g. on oil rigs  
 or abroad.                            </content>
