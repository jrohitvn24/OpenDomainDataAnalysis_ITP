		<content> "L'ile des Chevaux" - "Islandd of     
 Horses" - was the name given to       
 Inchkeith by the French troops        
 garrisoned there in the mid 1500's    
 because their horses thrived on the   
 grass. Mary of Guise visiting the     
 island, also had her own name for it -
 "L'ile Dieu" - "Gods Island".         
 The names are romantic, as is the     
 history of this rock which is situated
 in the Firth of Forth between the Fife
 town of Kinghorn (into which parish   
 the island falls) and the port of     
 Leith. It stands at a height of about 
 55m above sea level at its highest    
 point, where a lighthouse is perched, 
 and is approximately 1500m (1mile)    
 long and, on average, 450m (1/4mile).
