		<title>16FARMING IN ARNPRIOR</title>
		<content> The 10 farms all have some animals    
 with sheep being predominant.  Only   
 one small farm has no sheep and two of
 the mainly arable farms to the north  
 have only small flocks of 40 sheep.   
 Further south the flocks vary between 
 200 and 600 animals.  In total the    
 farms have more than l800 sheep       
 producing about 3000 lambs per year.  
 Blackface and blackface cross are     
 typical, but other breeds such as     
 Greyface, Cheviot, Suffolk and Border 
 Leicester are also present.  Lambing  
 occurs from February to April,        
 clipping is done in June and the sheep
 are dipped against parasites in July  
 or August.  Meat is the main value in 
 sheep, but the wool also brings a     
 small return. The animals are bought  
 and sold at Kildean market, Stirling.
