    One particular club which interests
 us is the{Riding for the Disabled     
{Association}which has a group in      
 Balfron, called the Endrick Valley    
 Group. It is a{charity club,}where    
 handicapped people are taught to ride,
 giving them a freedom of movement     
 which their own arms and legs cannot  
 give them. Handicapped children from  
 primary and secondary school attend   
 weekly for riding lessons, except when
 the weather is very cold.             </content>
