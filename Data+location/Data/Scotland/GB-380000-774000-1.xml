		<content>  This is a sparsely populated farming 
 area. The land varies from sea level  
 at the river Bervie in the South, to  
 150 metres on the hills to the        
 north-east.There is a church dating   
 from the 13th century, a hall, playing
 field, a former school, a general shop
 and sub-Post Office, and a telephone  
 kiosk. A volunteer bus service runs to
 Stonehaven on Friday mornings. There  
 are two main roads through the area,  
 several small roads and a right of    
 way.There are woods beside the river, 
 otherwise the ground is open,the      
 fields bounded by fences.
