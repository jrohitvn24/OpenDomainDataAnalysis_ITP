		<title>02THE HEATHER HUT IN EDDERTON</title>
		<content> One of the unusual features of        
 Edderton is{The Heather Hut.}The hut  
 was first built by the local people   
 in 1921.A collection had taken place  
 in order to build a memorial to the   
 people of Edderton who had been killed
 during the First World War.When they  
 had  completed the memorial,they had  
 some money left over,so it was decided
 that it would be used to build a      
 shelter for the people to sit in      
 during thier free time.It was built of
 wood and had a thatched heather       
 roof.Years later it was accidently    
 burned as were its two replacements.We
 are now in the process of making the  
 fourth{Heather Hut}using wood and ,of 
 course, heather.We hope we will soon  
 be able to say we have an attractive  
 feature, made by the local people     
 using the local material,of which we  
 can be very proud.                    </content>
