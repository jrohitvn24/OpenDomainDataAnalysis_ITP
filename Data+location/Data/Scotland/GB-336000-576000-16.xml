		<content> The most important development in the 
 road system in our area in recent     
 years was the opening of the Canonbie 
 by-pass in 1984. We did traffic       
 surveys on the road through Canonbie  
 village before and after the opening  
 of the new road. Before the by-pass   
 was built about 200 vehicles an hour  
 passed through the village; after the 
 by-pass about 80 vehicles an hour came
 through.{(see page 17 for by-pass)    
 The by-pass forms part of the A7 trunk
 road from Carlisle to Edinburgh. The  
 other major route in the area is the  
 B6357 which is part of the Annan-     
 Newcastleton-Jedburgh route.          
 The old A7 road through Canonbie is   
 now re-numbered as the B720.          
 The A7 has a mixed load of lorries and
 private cars, many of them tourists in
 the summer. The B6357 carries a cons- 
 iderable amount of forestry traffic.  </content>
