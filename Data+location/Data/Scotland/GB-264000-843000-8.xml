		<content>{THE CAMERON BARRACKS}ARE MADE OF LOCAL
 SANDSTONE AND MAINLY USED FOR TRAINING
 SOLDIERS. THE MOUNTAINS AND LOCHS     
 AROUND INVERNESS MAKE AN IDEAL        
 TRAINING GROUND. THERE IS A STAFF OF  
 FIFTY PEOPLE. THE COMMANDING OFFICER  
 IN CHARGE IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR     
 BASES AT FORT GEORGE, ST. ANDREWS AND 
 ONE OTHER. HE SUPERVISES SOLDIERS AND 
 CIVILIANS AT THESE BASES. THE {CAMERON
{BARRACKS} IS NOT THE HEADQUARTERS FOR 
 ANY PARTICULAR REGIMENT, BUT TRAINS   
 SOLDIERS FROM ALL OVER THE U.K. NEAR  
 THE BARRACKS ARE MARRIED QUARTERS FOR 
 SOLDIERS' FAMILIES. SOME FAMILIES ARE 
 EXPECTED BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR TO
 OCCUPY THE HOUSES. A PROBLEM HAS      
 ARISEN OVER THE SAFETY OF THE CHILDREN
 ON THEIR WAY TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL AT   
 RAIGMORE. TRAFFIC IS HEAVY IN THIS    
 AREA. REGIONAL AND DISTRICT COUNCILS  
 ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.      </content>
