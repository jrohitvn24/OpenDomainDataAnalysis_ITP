		<content>   The Fisheries Lab.was set up in 1950
 to study brown trout and investigate  
 methods of improving the stocks for   
 exploitation by anglers.This has now  
 been overtaken by greater interest in 
 Atlantic salmon , studying the effects
 of over-fishing, seal predation and   
 disease. New strains of fish are      
 researched and some are hatched in    
 special pens.  Another important role 
 of the Lab. is the study of pollution 
 and its effects , achieving correction
 where possible.The lab has            
 participated in several international 
 invesigations into pollution.The lab  
 has also be called in by the Police to
 investigate the illegal use of cyanide
 in the catching of fish.              
   About 50 people are employed in a   
 group of buildings including          
 chemistry and micro biology  labs.
