<title>32BUCHLYVIE CHURCHES - updated 2011</title>
<content>

The North Church was sold in 2001 and is expected to be converted to residental use.&lt;br />&lt;br />The South Church Manse was sold in 1986 and a new Manse in Culbowie Crescent was bought jointly with Gartmore in 1986.&lt;br />&lt;br />In 1998 a building extension provided a fully equipped kitchen, vestry, meeting room, a wheelchair accessible toilet and wheelchair access to the church.&lt;br />&lt;br />In addition to the uses mentioned previously there is now a "Wednesday Morning Fellowship" (a meeting with a short act of Worship followed by refreshments and Fellowship). A Tuesday Lunch Club which is open to all in the village is held during the winter months, as is a weekly Knit &amp; Natter group.&lt;br />&lt;br />In 2008 the North Church Graveyard was sold.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
