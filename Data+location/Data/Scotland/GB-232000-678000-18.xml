		<content>{COMMUNITY COUNCIL -}THIS IS THE BODY  
 THROUGH WHICH THE VILLAGERS CAN AIR   
 THEIR GRIEVANCES.  JUDGING BY THE     
 ATTENDANCES, HOWEVER, ONE GETS THE    
 IMPRESSION THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE QUITE 
 CONTENT WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE!  IN  
 FACT, MOST ARE JUST APATHETIC. PUBLIC{
 TOILETS ARE BEING CAMPAIGNED FOR AND  
 RUBBISH SKIPS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.      
{NUCLEAR BASES -}THESE DO NOT SEEM TO  
 CAUSE MUCH CONCERN, TO MOST PEOPLE,AT 
 ANY RATE, BUT THERE IS SOME DISQUIET  
 AT THE PROSPECT OF INCREASED HEAVY    
 TRAFFIC THROUGH THE VILLAGE WITH THE  
 COMING OF TRIDENT TO FASLANE.         
{DRUG REHABILITATION CENTRE -} THIS WAS
 SET UP AT KILMAHEW HOUSE, FORMERLY ST.
 PETER'S COLLEGE, AND RUN UNDER THE    
 AUSPICES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF        
 GLASGOW. THE NEED FOR IT IS           
 ACCEPTED,BUT THERE IS UNEASE AT ITS   
 PROXIMITY.                            </content>
