		<content>  Apart from those employed in the area
 in fishing, agriculture, shops and    
 services, people travel outwith the   
 area to work.  People travel to       
 Dounreay-a bus is laid on for them    
 (journey time 35-40 mins. by car), and
 Wick (journey time 15 mins.) There is 
 some seasonal work at John O'Groats,  
 and some people are involved in Bed   
 and Breakfast.                        
  To the south of the area Kestrel     
 Marine build pipelines onshore which  
 are lter towed out to oil rigs for    
 transporting crude North Sea oil. The 
 pipes can be built 2 miles long.      
                                       
{ENERGY} The west of the area is peat  
 land, and many people go out and cut  
 peats for their fires.  Most houses   
 have peat stacks outside them. A few  
 week's work in evenings and weekends  
 can provide cheap heat &amp; hot water.   </content>
