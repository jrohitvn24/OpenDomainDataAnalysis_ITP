		<title>09Forestry in our Area</title>
		<content> In our Domesday area there are a lot  
 of trees.They are mainly conifers but 
 there are some decidious trees aswell.
 During World War One one third of our 
 trees were cut down leaving two thirds
 ,but in World War Two another third of
 our trees were cut down leaving only  
 one third.After the two World Wars,   
 Mr.Matheson,the Laird of Brahan Estate
 ,planted more trees so that we now    
 have a large area of forest.To start  
 off Mr.Matheson and his workers       
 planted one stand of trees to try them
 out.After about thirty years          
 Mr.Matheson goes out to thin the      
 plantation.About ten years ago        
 Mr.Matheson stopped planting trees.   
 Mr.Matheson has lots of plans for our 
 forests.He plans to make walks through
 the forests.The main deciduous trees  
 he grows are Oak,Ash and Birch ,while 
 the main conifers are Scots Pine.     </content>
