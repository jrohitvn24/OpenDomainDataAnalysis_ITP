		<content> ABERDEEN: A DAY IN THE LIFE OF MY MUM.
                                       
                                       
 My Mum is called Irene. She           
 is 33 and has two daughters. On       
 Wednesday  19th June 1985 my Mum got  
 up at 7.10a.m to go to work. She went 
 downstairs to the kitchen to make     
 coffee and have a glass of fruit      
 juice. Then she shouted "Nicky it's   
 time to get up." When I got dressed   
 my Mum made me tea and toast.         
                                       
 When I left for school Mum waved me   
 goodbye. At 8.15a.m Mum got dressed,  
 did the housework and went out to     
 work.                                 
                                       
 She worked from 10.00a.m until 3.00p.m
 in a nursery in town. She has a       
 sandwich for dinner at 12.00p.m.
