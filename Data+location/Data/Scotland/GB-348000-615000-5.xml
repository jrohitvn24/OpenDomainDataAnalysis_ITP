		<title>05INDUSTRY IN BURNFOOT.</title>
		<content>                                       
  Burnfoot has quite a lot of industry 
 and has an industrial estate of       
 factory units which house Slumberdown,
 Elliot Aluminium, Barrie Knitwear and 
 British Beef. In addition to these    
 there are a few small knitwear        
 factories, including Lyle &amp; Scott and 
 a car body repair shop.Slumberdown is 
 the most advanced technologically and 
 has huge complicated machines which   
 perform many different functions at   
 the same time. Computers control the  
 flow of work, weigh the amount of     
 fillings in the quilts and measure the
 'tog' value, or heat retaining        
 capacity of each quilt.Strangely      
 enough, few of our parents work in    
 Burnfoot, but travel into Hawick,     
 where the main knitwear factories are 
 situated.
