		<title>10BRAES SHOPPING AND TRANSPORT</title>
		<content>   There  is  no  longer  a shop in the
 area,  but  milk  is  delivered  every
 other day, twice a week  a baker's van
 comes, and a fishman  once. There is a
 general   store   4  miles   away   at
 Tomnavoulin and  for  a  nominal  fee,
 goods  can  be  delivered by the Royal
 Mail. As  the  school  bus is the only
 public  transport,  most  people  have
 cars  and  can  travel to centres like
 Elgin, Inverness and Aberdeen. Several
 weeks supplies  are  usually bought at
 once to save on  travelling  expenses,
 and  also  during  the  winter  to  be
 prepared  to  be cut off for some time
 by snow-blocked  roads. In  spring and
 Autumn, large drapery vans  visit  the
 area with household  utensiles as well
 as cloths, sheets, towels etc.        
   Once a fortnight the  mobile library
 calls with a wide selection on offer.
