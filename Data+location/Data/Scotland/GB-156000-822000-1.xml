		<content> The block is totally uninhabited, and 
 contains no evidence of man other than
 a part of the A881 that shirts around 
 Loch Slapin towards Elgol. The area   
 is a mixture of Loch River and Bog    
 with the harsh granite scenery of     
 Beinn Deag Mhor rising in the east.   
 The land has two main uses, firstly   
 for sheep grazing and secondly as an  
 amenity for all sorts of people from  
 town, city and local who want to see  
 the sparse remains of an unspoilt     
 landscape. At a time when mans mark   
 has been left scaring most of our once
 beautiful landscape a reminder such as
 this is wonderful.
