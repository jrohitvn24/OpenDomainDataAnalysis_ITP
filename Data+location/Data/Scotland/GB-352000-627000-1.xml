		<content>{This}is an area of sparsely populated 
 countryside, undulating gently from a 
 height of 261 metres in the West to 42
 metres in the East. Much of the land  
 is under crops but a great deal of the
 land cover is rough grazing.          
{The}land is dissected by several small
 streams flowing from West to East,    
 which eventually join the Tweed,      
 Midlem Burn being the most important. 
 There are small plantations of        
 coniferous and deciduous trees acting 
 mainly as wind-breaks or fox coverts. 
{The}main centre of settlement is found
 at the village of Midlem (population  
 92) the remainder being small farms   
 and isolated houses.                  
{The}A699 from St Boswells to Selkirk  
 crosses from the North-East to the    
 West and there are a number of        
 secondary roads and footpaths.
