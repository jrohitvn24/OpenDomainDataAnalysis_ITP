		<content> SHEEP-    Three farmers have breeding 
 flocks of Cross Greyfaced Ewes. Hill  
 ewe lambs are wintered by some farmers
 and returned to the hill farms for the
 rest of their lives.                  
                                       
 COWS-     There are only two farms in 
 this area which have 'house' cows i.e.
 milk produced is for farmhouse use    
 only. Surplus is fed to calves.       
                                       
 CATTLE-   Farmers have mainly 'bought-
 in' calves which are kept until 18    
 months old then sold as store cattle  
 to other farmers for fattening up.    
                                       
 POULTRY-  Hens are kept at a few      
 farms. The eggs are for home          
 consumption only.
