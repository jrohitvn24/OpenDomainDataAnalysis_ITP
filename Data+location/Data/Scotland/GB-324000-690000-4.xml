		<content>    Although{Kirkcaldy}is not a tourist
 town as such, its amenities make it a 
 pleasant place to visit.              
    This area is the main shopping     
 centre of Fife,with many large shops  
 and recently opened indoor shopping   
 malls.                                
   In the 97 acres  of the{Beveridge   
{Park}there are all the facilities for 
 a family day out.There are bowling    
 greens and tennis courts, a boating   
 lake, a children's play area, and     
 facilities for picnics and outdoor    
 sports as well as many pleasant walks.
   Another open space well worth       
 a visit is the{War Memorial Gardens   
 in the centre of the town.This is a   
 most attractive place to sit on a     
 summer's day and view some of the     
 town's most attractive buildings.
