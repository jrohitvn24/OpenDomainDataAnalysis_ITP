		<title>05The Pier at Baltasound</title>
		<content>  It is difficult to imagine nowadays  
 the busy scene at Baltasound pier at  
 the height of the herring fishing.    
 Unst's position in the North Sea made 
 it a natural choice as a harbour for  
 the hundreds of decked sailing boats  
 working the herring season. By 1900   
 as many as 700 boats might be fishing 
 from there.The small local community  
 was swelled by the influx of workers- 
 gutters,usually lassies who followed  
 the trade to different Scotish ports, 
 coopers and clerks. Photographs show  
 the area all around the pier piled    
 high with barrels,ready to be filled  
 with salted herring.When the steam    
 drifter took over from the sailing    
 boat,Lerwick took over as the main    
 fishing market.Nowadays,it is a safe  
 harbour for stormbound boats but no   
 boats now sail from this home pier.
