		<content> Totscore is a crofting town ship      
 between Kilmuir and Vig.  There are   
 about twenty houses, most of them     
 old.  The crofts grow mostly grass for
 hay to feed cattle &amp; sheep.  The road 
 from Kilmuir zigzags down to Vig in   
 hairpin bends.  The view is very      
 spectacular.  it is a narrow,         
 single-track road with passing-places 
 for vehicles.  Vig is an old village  
 with about 300 of a population.It has 
 one main shop both bakery and post    
 office and another small one mostly   
 selling sweets.  There are two        
 churches, a free church and a church  
 of Scotland and one police man who    
 lives at the Police Station in the    
 middle of the village. there is a     
 football pitch and a playpark for the 
 children down by the phone and a      
 village hall.
