		<content> The Lanark area is very interesting to
 a student of {Politics}because of the 
 strange mixture of the political make 
 up of the town. At a national level   
 the town is represented by Dame Judith
 Hart ,who holds the constituency for  
 the {Labour Party},whereas at a local 
 level the town is represented by two {
{Independants},who are inclined towards
 the {Conservative Party}. At a local  
 level however no one party holds      
 overall control as the other parts of 
 Clydesdale District have returned     
 other types of candidate.The results  
 of the next general election could be 
 interesting as Dame Judith Hart is    
 retiring.Maybe the S.D.P.Alliance     
 might make some headway due to the    
 results obtained in the last          
 election.Apart from the Labour and    
 Conservative parties the Liberals and 
 the Scottish Nationalists are active. </content>
