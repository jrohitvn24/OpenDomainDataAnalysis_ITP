		<title>10HOUSING RENOVATION PROGRAMME</title>
		<content>   The area of Knightsridge in         
 Livingston is due for a complete      
 renovation programme. Recently the    
 Livingston Development Corporation has
 been moving people out of their homes 
 while work is being done to improve   
 the area. New central heating systems 
 have been installed and wall          
 insulation has been provided. Internal
 walls have been knocked down and      
 replaced with thicker walls made of a 
 different material to counteract      
 condensation. Many houses which were  
 built in a square formation are too   
 close together and some of these are  
 being knocked down to open up the     
 squares and give the residents more   
 space around their homes. Although    
 there will be some disruption to the  
 residents it is hoped that in the     
 future Knightsridge will be an area to
 be proud of.                          </content>
