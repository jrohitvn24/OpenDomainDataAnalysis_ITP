		<title>11RELIGIOUS BELIEFS</title>
		<content> Here are some extracts of what l2-l3  
 year olds believe:- "I believe there  
 is a god and he did send his son to   
 earth but I don't see why we should go
 to mass to praise Jesus because you   
 could do the same in your own home.  I
 only go to mass because my Dad tells  
 me to go"                             
 "I believe there is a Heaven and a    
 Hell and that there will be a         
 judgement day when Jesus will come to 
 the earth again and tell people their 
 sins, and whether they will go to     
 Heaven or Hell.  I hope that I go to  
 Heaven and not to Hell.  I don't      
 suppose anybody would like to go to   
 Hell".                                
 "I believe that there is a God but, I 
 also doubt that there is a God because
 he lets all the Ethiopians suffer and 
 starve and slowly die".
