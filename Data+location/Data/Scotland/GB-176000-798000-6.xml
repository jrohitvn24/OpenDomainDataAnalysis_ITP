		<content> THE MAIN FORMS OF ENERGY USED ARE     
 HYDRO ELECTRICITY,COAL,PEAT AND WOOD. 
{HYDRO ELECTRICITY }THERE IS A PRIVATE 
 HYDRO ELECTRIC SCHEME WHICH MAKES USE 
 OF THE HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE AREA.THE 
 WATER IS STORED IN LOCH BRAOMISAIG.   
{COAL}THIS IS BROUGHT FROM MALLAIG ON  
 THE "SPANISH JOHN" ONLY ONCE PER YEAR.
{PEAT}MANY FAMILIES IN SPRING GO TO THE
 PEAT HAGS TO CUT SUFFICIENT PEAT FOR A
 YEAR.THIS IS LEFT TO DRY OUT AND THEN 
 CARRIED HOME FOR LATER USE.           
{WOOD}THIS IS ALSO USED AS FUEL.THE MEN
 OF THE VILLAGE CUT THE FALLEN WOOD OR 
 IT CAN BE PURCHASED FROM THE MILL.    
 MOST HOUSES HAVE SOLID FUEL STOVES    
 WHICH FROM ONE ENERGY SOURCE PROVIDE  
 HEATING,COOKING AND HOT WATER.
