		<title>02RHUM NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE</title>
		<content> Rhum became a{National Nature Reserve 
 in 1957 on its purchase from{Lady     
{Monica Bullough.}The outstanding      
 natural features which justify its    
 status include its unique and varied  
 geology and mosaic of vegetation      
 communities representative of N.W.    
 Scotland; a large population of{Manx  
{Shearwaters;}1400{Red Deer;}4 pairs of
{Golden Eagle}and other restricted     
 species such as{Peregrine}and the     
{Norwegian Sandwort.}There is also a   
 herd of{feral goats.}A further        
 attribute, making Rhum an ideal site  
 for ecological research, is that it is
 an island,with finite boundaries,where
 access &amp; disturbance is limited &amp;     
 where no other interests impinge on   
 management for wildlife conservation. 
 The geology, flora &amp; fauna, has been  
 extensively surveyed &amp; mapped &amp; there 
 is a continuous monitoring programme. </content>
