		<title>01East of Benmore Lodge</title>
		<content> Most of the area east of Benmore Lodge
 is covered by young coniferous trees  
 planted by the Forestry Commission. In
 square 3211, there are several        
 buildings: the Lodge, which is in the 
 process of being built (the last one  
 having been knocked down several years
 ago), a bothy, the keepers cottage,   
 which is the only inhabited house and 
 various outbuildings.                 
                                       
 The keeper and his family live at     
 Benmore Lodge all the time. His job is
 to look after the wildlife and sport  
 on Benmore Estate. This involves      
 culling the deer to keep the numbers  
 at the size which the ground can      
 support, grouse-shooting (although    
 there are only a few birds on the     
 estate), fishing and keeping the parks
 and buildings in order.
