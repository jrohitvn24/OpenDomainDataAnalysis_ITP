 in the Balfron district, the many     
 streams flowing into the River        
 Endrick, the roadside verges, the     
 hedge-rows and "dry-stane dykes" all

 the Balfron area.                     
   {Roedeer, badgers}and{foxes}are all

 Endrick over the last few years and   
 poaching,on an organised basis, is on 
 the increase,according to the{Water
