		<title>03THE GROUSE MOOR -EDDERTON</title>
		<content> In the moorlands near Edderton there  
 are several breeding pairs of{grouse} 
 although their numbers have been      
 dwindling in  recent years. As their  
 staple diet is mainly young{heather   
 shoots they are mostly found in the   
 open moor.In spring they nest on the  
 ground.They have excellent{camouflage 
 so until they are disturbed they are  
 very difficult to see when sitting in 
 the heather.In the past few years     
 large parts of the habitat of the     
 grouse near Edderton has been planted 
 with trees as they are more economic  
 than grouse.However the local estate  
 organises a shooting expedition on    
 August the twelfth called{"The        
{Glorious Twelfth"}each year as this   
 is the first day of the grouse        
 shooting season.
