		<title>08FISHING IN GLENLIVET</title>
		<content>   The   River   Avon   rises  in   the
 Cairngorms and is fed  by  many  burns
 and rivers, one  being the Livet which
 rises  in  the  Ladder  Hills.   These
 rivers have many  pools  where  salmon
 and trout rest on their way to or from
 the  spawning  grounds. The fast clear
 water  with  slack areas provide ideal
 locations for anglers.                
  The fishing rights to the River Livet
 belong to  the  Community  and permits
 are sold by  the Community Association
 to  both  locals  and  tourists   with
 locals   paying  a  nominal  fee.  Any
 profit  is  distributed  to  clubs and
 charities in the area.                
   In Scotland you can  fish for  brown
 trout  without  a  permit  and many an
 angler owes  his  skill to hours spent
 in childhood fishing  the  small burns
 for trout.
