		<title>05HOUSING IN KILTARLITY</title>
		<content> The housing in the area is mostly of a
 scattered nature,the largest group of 
 houses being in the village centre of 
 Kiltarlity.The houses vary greatly in 
 type and age.A survey of the 51       
 families in Tomnacross school produced
 these results.                        
 Detached       28   Own garden    50  
 Semi-detached  14   Open fire     45  
 Terraced        9   Second storey 36  
          Central heating  25          
                                       
 Recently there has been a great deal  
 of new building in the area,with about
 30 new private houses being started or
 completed in the last year.Almost all 
 the new houses are bungalow types.    
 Of the houses built in the last 5     
 years about 20% have been built on    
 crofts to replace the original croft  
 houses.Many other croft houses have   
 been modernised or extended.          </content>
