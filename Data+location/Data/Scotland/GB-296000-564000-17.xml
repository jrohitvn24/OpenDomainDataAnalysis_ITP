		<title>17NEW ABBEY - RELIGION</title>
		<content>   The ruin of the earliest known      
 church is on an island on Loch Kindar.
   In 1273 Sweetheart Abbey was built  
 by Lady Devorgilla on the banks of the
 Pow 2 miles away.This Cistercian Abbey
 became the centre of the religious    
 life of the parish.                   
    A Protestant congregation came into
 being at the Reformation and a church 
 was built on the cloister green.This  
 church was replaced by the present    
 building half a mile away in 1877.    
   The congregation of 300 comes from  
 the village and surrounding area. It  
 shares its minister with the nearby   
 congregation of Lochend as part of the
 national Church of Scotland.          
   The Roman Catholic church of St Mary
 in the village has a small membership 
 augmented by visitors in the summer.  
 This church and area are served by the
 clergy of St Andrew's Church,Dumfries.</content>
