		<content> Nelson's Tower is built on Cluny Hill,
 Forres.It is an octagonal shaped tower
 built in 1806 to commemorate the death
 of Admiral Lord Nelson in the Battle  
 of Trafalgar, (1805).                 
  Inside there was originally a marble 
 bust of Lord Nelson, and two cannons  
 from Lord Nelson's victorious         
 Trafalgar ship, the Victory.          
 It has many uses, as a navigational   
 beacon for ships and aircraft, as a   
 vantage point or lookout post in time 
 of war and as a viewpoint.            
  Inside there is also a stone spiral  
 staircase leading to the top 70 feet  
 above the ground.From the top, the    
 surrounding countryside is spread out 
 beneath, giving a considerable view of
 up to 30km on a clear day.            
  Recently the tower was closed because
 the masonry and woodwork is all       
 crumbling and could collapse.         </content>
