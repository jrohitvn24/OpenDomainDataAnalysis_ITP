   I stay at Kirkhill Farm at          
 Johnstonebridge with my Mother,Father 
 and my brothers John and Alec. I help 
 at the weekends and holidays . Mum    
 looks after us and feeds us. We have a
 lot of grass in our  fields. We grow  
 hay , silage ,potatoes and barley. We 
 have 100 milking cows on the farm.Dad 
 does the milking. The milk is         
 collected at 1 o'clock  and most of it
 goes to the cheese factory.           
     We have an International tractor. 
 John does most of the ploughing. They 
 will be digging ditches and are trying
 to unchoke a drain. The drain is full 
 of muck and my Father cannot push the 
 draining rods up it.                  
      Our farm is beside the Railway,  
 the River Annan and the A74 dual      
 carriageway.
