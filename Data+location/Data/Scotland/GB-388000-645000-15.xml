		<title>15Norham Castle</title>
		<content> No matter where you might stand in    
 Norham you can be pretty certain      
 you'll always be able to see the      
 castle. It stands high up on a hill   
 keeping watch over the quiet little   
 village.                              
    Norhams' first castle was built    
 round about 1121 of wood.             
 The present massive stone Keep        
 was built about 1154 and would surely 
 have been the hub of the area.        
 In the course of the next 437 years it
 was besieged 14 times and captured 7  
 times,until falling into disuse in    
 1603 after the Union of the Crowns.   
    The masonry for the older houses in
 the village and Morris Hall all are   
 built from the ruins.                 
    Since 1925 it has been maintained  
 as an Ancient Monument and is open    
 9.30 - 1800 in summer, 9.30 - 1600 in 
 winter.                               </content>
