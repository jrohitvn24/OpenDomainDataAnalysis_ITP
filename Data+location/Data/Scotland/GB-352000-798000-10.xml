		<title>10Farming in the Aboyne Area</title>
		<content> The{farming}of the area is based on   
 the production of{beef cattle.} The   
{crops}which are grown are mainly for  
 winter feeding of livestock.  Potatoes
 are grown for human consumption. There
 is also some commercial forestry, this
 has increased in the past few years,  
 some areas not being shown on the map.
 Many of the farms and steadings are   
 very old.  A typical example of a farm
 in the area is Rosehill Farm.  The    
 farmhouse and steadings are at 541997.
 The farm has 44 hectares.  24 of      
 arable land where barley, oats,       
 turnips, potatoes and grass, for hay  
 and silage, are grown.  The other 20  
 hectares are rough{pasture}used for   
 grazing cattle and shooting.  The     
 steadings, which are quite old, are   
 used for storing winter feed.  The    
 cattle are sold at the Aboyne or      
 Aberdeen marts for meat.              </content>
