		<title>01Tarland and area to east</title>
		<content> The area is generally low lying 150 to
 200 metres agricultural land with the 
 village of Tarland in the west and the
 lower slopes of some of the           
 surrounding hills in the east.        
 Most of the land is intensively farmed
 in large units most of which are part 
 of the Macrobert Estates. Although    
 cereal production, barley and wheat,  
 is important, dairy and beef cattle as
 well as sheep are extensively reared. 
 Trees have been planted in some of the
 less well drained area and as shelter 
 belts.                                
 Tarland village services the rural    
 area that surrounds it by providing   
 basic shopping, facilities, a selction
 of tradesman, banks, primary schools, 
 and a church. The population is very  
 much an ageing one with a markedly    
 diminishing school roll Employment
