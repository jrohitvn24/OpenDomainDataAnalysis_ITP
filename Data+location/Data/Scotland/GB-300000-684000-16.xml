		<title>16TORRYBURN BYPASS</title>
		<content>{The Torryburn Bypass runs to the north
{of the villages of Torryburn, Newmills
{and High Valleyfield and takes the    
{majority of the traffic away from     
{these villages.                       
 The road has a bad reputation in the  
 area in that many accidents have      
 occurred on that stretch of road,     
 possibly because it is a fairly       
 straight road, but is not of a        
 standard of a motorway.               
 In 1983 a five year old High          
 Valleyfield boy was killed on the     
 Bypass. St Serfs Primary School now   
 have a trophy_{The Mark Beveridge     
{Trophy}awarded for general excellence}
 in P7. In recent months{barriers}have}
 been erected at the roadside behind   
 High Valleyfield near the Bluther     
 Bridge.
