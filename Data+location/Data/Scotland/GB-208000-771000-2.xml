		<content>{Crofting.}                            
 A croft is a small farm.A crofter     
 doesnt earn a lot of money,so many    
 crofters have another job as well.A   
 crofter would own a few cows or sheep 
 and he would own a few fields.Crofting
 is a way of life and not only an      
 occupation.                           
 There used to be several crofts at    
 Druimarbin,but now there are houses   
 and hotels where the crofts used to   
 be.There are still some crofts across 
 the loch in Trislaig.                 
                                       
{Tourism.}

 in this area.There are 10 hotels and  
 approximately 200 Bed and Breakfast   
 establishments in this

 world to visit Fort William.Because of
