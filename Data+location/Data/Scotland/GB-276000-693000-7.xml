		<title>07Employment in Stirling</title>
		<content> The people who are employed in        
 Stirling mainly give a service to the 
 public or work in offices. Of those   
 who are employed outside Stirling most
 have chosen to live in Stirling       
 because it is ideally situated between
 two of the main industrial cities,    
 Glasgow and Edinburgh. There are also 
 a few new development schemes on the  
 outskirts of Stirling which will      
 supply jobs for the future if given   
 sufficient funding.                   
   There have been many redundancies   
 due to the closures of Fine Fare,     
 Halfords, Players Cigarette Factory,  
 Carpet Factories and six other        
 factories. Their closures has given   
 way to smaller enterprises. There are 
 only two production factories left in 
 Stirling- the Rubber Factory and the  
 Sausage Factory.
