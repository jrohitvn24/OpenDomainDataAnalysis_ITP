		<title>08A Walk Up Mulderie _ Mulben</title>
		<content> On Thursday evening, the children in  
 our school who are working on The     
 Doomsday Project went for a walk up to
 the top of the Hill of Mulderie.  We  
 went by car until we reached the      
 forest road.  At first, the forest    
 road was very muddy, but as we went   
 higher up ,the road became drier. Mr  
 Duncan showed us how to recognise     
 animal tracks.  We saw deer tracks and
 could see where the path they made led
 down through the trees, across the    
 road, and on down to the water.       
 Suddenly, we heard a yapping noise    
 that sounded like a puppy.  It was a  
 young fox cub barking.                
 We saw some wild ducks, and we        
 collected feathers of the wood_pigeon.
 At the top of the hill ,we added      
 stones to the cairn.                  
 Coming down was much easier than going
 up.                                   </content>
