		<content> EXAMPLES OF GAMES PLAYED BY CHILDREN  
 IN OUR AREA-BOARD GAMES,FOOTBALL,HIDE 
 AND SEEK AND MANY MORE.HERE ARE TWO   
 GAMES WHICH WE THINK BELONG TO OUR    
 AREA-1".STONES AND GRAVEL",IT IS A    
 VERY POPULAR GAME LOCALLY.RULES:ONE   
 PERSON GOES AWAY AND COUNTS TO TWENTY 
 MEANWHILE OTHERS RUN ABOUT THE        
 PLAYGROUND.THE PERSON WHO IS "IT" THEN
 GIVES CHASE AND TRIES TO TAG THE OTHER
 PLAYERS.IF A PLAYER IS TAGGED THE     
 PPERSON WHO IS IT SHOUTS "STONE" AND  
 THAT PERSON MUST STAND STILL UNTIL A  
 FRIEND TAGS HIM FREE BY SHOUTING      
 "GRAVEL".THE GAME GOES ON UNTIL       
 EVERYONE PLAYING HAS BEEN             
 TAGGED.EVERYONE IS THEN TAGGED FREE BY
 LEAVING THE FIRST PERSON CAUGHT TO BE 
 IT FOR THE NEXT GAME.
