		<content>    Mugdrum Park lies at the west end  
 of the High Street next to the bowling
 club, stretching from the High Street 
 almost right down to the River Tay. At
 the bottom of the park near the river 
 there are swings, a slide, climbing   
 frame and a rocket. In the middle of  
 the park there is a roundabout,       
 climbing frame and swings. At the top 
 of the park there are two trampolines,
 swingball facilities and a Putting    
 Green.  Opening hours are Mon. to Fri.
 6pm to 8pm and at the weekend 2pm to  
 5pm and 6pm to 8pm.                   
    The Highland games are held in the 
 park every year. This year and in 1984
 Geoff Capes competed in the Tossing   
 the Caber event and in 1983 Radio Tay 
 visited the games. The opening day of 
 the Newburgh Festival is held in      
 Mugdrum Park.
