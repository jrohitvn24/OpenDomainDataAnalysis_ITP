		<title>09Housing on Papa Stour.</title>
		<content> In the past there were many houses on 
 Papa Stour,but only 10 are inhabited  
 now.They are alike in that they face  
 East,with no doors on the West side   
 because of the prevailing Westerly    
 winds.                                
    All the houses on the island are   
 built of stone and mortar,many are    
 rendered and white-washed.Most houses 
 have tarred roofs,and in summer-time  
 you can see men on the roofs tarring. 
 To make this job easier the roofs     
 have a flat apex to walk along.       
    Most of the houses started as a    
 single story but were extended up-    
 wards to provide more bedrooms.Only   
 half of the houses have bathrooms.    
 All of the houses on the island are   
 croft houses except the school-house, 
 which is a council house.The only     
 public buildings are the kirk and the 
 school and the shed at the pier!      </content>
