		<title>01Shapinsay-Orkneys</title>
		<content> This 4km x 3km block of land on the   
 east side of Shapinsay Island is      
 typical of the low rolling hills seen 
 in all the Orkneys.   It consists     
 nearly entirely now of intensively    
 managed grassland which is common of  
 todays farming practice in this land. 
 There is a strip of rough grazing     
 along the low rocky cliffs which      
 stretch along this section.   There   
 are approx. 4 inhabited farms, but the
 remains of several older houses show  
 that it has been origionally more     
 densely populated and there is the    
 history of some fishing having been   
 done.   The remains of a 12th century 
 chapel near the shore suggest that it 
 was a very early settlement perhaps by
 the norse.   There are no photographic
 features of any note.
