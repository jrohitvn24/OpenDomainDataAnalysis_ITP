		<title>19Colvend: Tourism</title>
		<content>   In the region of Dumfries and       
 Galloway tourism is being encouraged  
 so as to give people employment, since
 there is no industry and farming      
 employs fewer people now than it did  
 in the past.                          
   Tourists come mainly from England,  
 Ireland or Europe though some are     
 Scots. They usually stay for one or   
 two nights because they are touring in
 the region.                           
   Those who come here do so because it
 is quiet and they like the scenery.The
 visitors tend to be older people, or  
 families with young children who can  
 play on the beaches.                  
   Some people take visitors for "bed  
 and breakfast",but in our area about  
 one third of the houses are let for   
 holidays,which means that in winter   
 many houses lie empty.
