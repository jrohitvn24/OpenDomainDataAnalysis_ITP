		<content>   Looking along Atholl road ,the main 
 shopping street in Pitlochry ,it would
 be difficult to miss the concentration
 of shops dealing in knick-knacks,     
 souvenirs and genuine Scottish        
 gifts.All very well for the tourists  
 but a bit repetitive even for them.   
   Coming a close second are the       
 number of woollen shops - a man from  
 Mars might think the locals eat wool  
 since there are more of them by far   
 than grocers or food shops .There are 
 no authentic super markets , though   
 there is a delicatessan.              
   For young people there is nothing ! 
 Other plans to provide a Chinese carry
 out or a proper supermarket have so   
 far been squashed -Pitlochry's image  
 must be kept up .Back to the tourists:
 a comon response when questioned,     
 "Gee, what a cute little old town ."
