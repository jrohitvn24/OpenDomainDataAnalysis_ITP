		<title>12Heathfield Farm, Thurso</title>
		<content> Heathfield has no cows, no bulls and  
 no calves but 80 stirks.  The farm is 
 150 acres.  The metal buildings are   
 about 64 years old and the stone      
 buildings are about 150 years old.    
 There are 11 fields and all of them   
 are used for animals but in the sowing
 time of the year 3 fields are used for
 hay.  They also keep ewes and 113     
 lambs.  They grow 250 tonnes of their 
 foodstuff.  The rest they buy from    
 merchants.  Feeding time for the      
 animals is 7.30 am and 5.00 pm.  In   
 the future they hope to buy more land 
 and build new buildings.  They stop   
 diseases infecting their cattle with  
 dosing and treatment.  They call the  
 vet for advice and treatment.  They   
 have a tractor and the machinery they 
 use are a cultivator and a grass      
 harvester.  They get up at 7.00 am    
 and they work for 15 hours.           </content>
