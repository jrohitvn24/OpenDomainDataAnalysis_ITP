		<content>    Roman Road is another aptly named  
 road as it leads to the site of a     
{Roman fort}which is visible nowadays  
 as a tree covered mound. In Mediaeval 
 times, a{"Motte and Bailey" castle}was
 built where the Roman fort had been.  
    Dunkeld Court and Burns-Begg       
 Crescent are both recently named      
 streets, the former being after       
{Lt.Col. John Dunkeld,}a local         
 councillor for many years, and the    
 latter after the{Rev. Burns-Begg,}who 
 was minister in the North Church for  
 many years and was a descendant of the
 famous poet Robert Burns.             
    A{single track railway}ran through 
 the area on its way along the Blane   
 Valley. Passenger trains were used to 
 bring holiday-makers into the area,   
 while farmers had their milk          
 transported more quickly into the     
 town (last passenger train in 1934).  </content>
