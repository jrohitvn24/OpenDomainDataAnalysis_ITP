		<title>04LIVING IN A TOWER BLOCK</title>
		<content> Mrs Sanders lives on the{fourteenth}  
 floor of a{sixteen}storey block of    
 flats.  She has lived there for five  
 years with her husband and two sons   
 and she likes it very much.  She      
 enjoys the view from her verandah.    
 She can see Strathclyde Park, the     
 Duchess Park and Fir Park.  She has a 
 tiny garden on her verandah where she 
 grows flowers, beetroot, parsley and  
 lettuce.                              
 Living in a{Tower Block}does have some
 disadvantages.  The lift sometimes    
 takes a long time to come and in      
 strong winds it can sway alarmingly.  
 Occasionally passers-by use the lift  
 as a{public toilet. }When people are  
 moving into or out of the block, they 
 have to dismantle large items of      
 furniture which are too big for the   
 lift.  The residents are not allowed  
 to keep{cats}or{dogs}which need walks.</content>
