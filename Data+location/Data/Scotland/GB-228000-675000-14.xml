		<content> The dominant type of housing within   
 the area, Customs House Quay along the
 waterfront to the Bus Depot as far    
 back as Wellington Park, is council   
 housing.  There are some private      
 dwellings, old cottage bungalows, to  
 be found in the Leven Road, Bawhirley 
 Road, Kilmacolm Road, Belville Street 
 and Auchmountain Road areas.  The     
 council housing, which is all rented  
 accommodation is made up of high rise 
 flats, tenement flats and maisonettes.
 In Belville Street, seven high rise   
 blocks of flats are known as the Seven
 Sisters and their names come from     
 Scottish Border Towns, Hawick,        
 Jedburgh, Kelso, Langholm, Melrose    
 Peebles and Selkirk. An interesting   
 feature is the recent construction of 
 a small housing complex, Carwood Court
 which is designed for the old and     
 infirm.                               </content>
