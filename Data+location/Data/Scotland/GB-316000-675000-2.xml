		<title>02CRAMOND :A Description</title>
		<content> Cramond in 1985 is a quiet place in   
 the winter and early summer. When     
 tourists start arriving in Edinburgh  
 they tend to come to Cramond to see   
 the Roman Fort, the Bishop's Tower,   
 the river, the ferry, the foreshore on
 both sides of the tidal River Almond  
 and of course the island. This is when
 Cramond starts to get noisy with the  
 roar of cars and the questioning of   
 inquisitive tourists. It also gets    
 very mucky with litter. There are     
 several clubs which operate here      
 because of all the neighbourhood      
 facilities. There are quite a few     
 cafes and restaurants where you       
 can get lovely food. The one at the   
 top of Glebe Road sells cold food, hot
 snacks and dinners. One disadvantage  
 is that we are so close to the airport
 and get all the jumbo jets flying     
 overhead several times a day.         </content>
