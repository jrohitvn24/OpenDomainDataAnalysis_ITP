		<title>09INDUSTRY THE SAWMILL.</title>
		<content> The industry of TROON would be        
 incomplete without a text on the      
 SAWMILL. This branch of heavy industry
 was vital to the expansion of the     
 sea/faring port.The founder was ADAM  
 WILSON.He became a saw/doctor with the
 TROON SHIPBUILDING CO. but longed to  
 work with timber.His first sawmill was
 at SORN in 1856 then on to TROON.The  
 dream became a reality. By the year   
 1913 the now large sawmill was within 
 felling distance of the shipyard and  
 the future looked secure.Then came the
 holocaust of WORLD WAR 1.The most     
 important single factor on the timber 
 industry was the degree of control the
 MINISTRY OF SUPPLY had over its       
 work.However to this day THE SAWMILL  
 is still a major employer in the      
 town.The emphasis is now concentrated 
 on the construction of TIMBER FRAMED  
 houses.                               </content>
