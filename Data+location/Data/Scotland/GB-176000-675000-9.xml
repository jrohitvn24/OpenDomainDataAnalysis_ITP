		<content> Between the 2 estates there are       
 approx. 3000 breeding ewes (Mostly    
 Scottish Blackface) on hill and low   
 ground, with between 70 and 80 rams.  
 They are looked after by 2 shepherds  
 with extra help at busy times. Lambing
 percentage on the hill is approx. 80% 
 and on low ground approx. 150%        
 The lambs are sold at about 6 months  
 in the markets at Dalmally, Tarbert   
 (Loch Fyne) or Stirling. The average  
 price for a hill lamb in 1984 was Â£25 
 but around 900 ewe lambs are kept each
 year to join the flock. Barley and    
 sheep cake are bought in to supplement
 the grazing.                          
 The price for each fleece can vary    
 between Â£1 and Â£8 depending on its    
 condition. This is sold to the        
 Scottish Wool Marketing Board.
