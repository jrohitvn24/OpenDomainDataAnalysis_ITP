		<content> Reswallie Mains Farm is run by two    
 workers and two dogs. They do not     
 specialise in any specific aspect of{ 
{FARMING}, but they do have a slight   
 preference for the{ARABLE}side of     
 farming. Crops grown include oil seed 
 rape (sown in Autumn), Spring Barley  
 (sown in March), wheat (early Autumn) 
 and potatoes (April) of which the     
 varieties Maris Piper, Javelin,       
 Pentland Dell and Home Guard are      
 grown.                                
 On the farm cattle are fattened and   
 sheep are reared commercially.        
 The{LIFESTYLE}of the workers is very  
 exhausting, as they have to rise at   
 seven and work until the days work is 
 finished.                             
 There is not a steady{INCOME}since it 
 depends on the quality and quantity of
 the crops.                            
                                       </content>
