		<title>11LUNAN AREA, AGRICULTURE.</title>
		<content> The farms in this area are mostly     
 arable. The main crops are wheat and  
 barley though recently, with          
 encouragement from the E.E.C.,oil seed
 rape has been grown and the acreage is
 increasing. Another crop recently     
 introduced has been protein peas;     
 these are harvested dry and used for  
 animal feed.Turnips are also grown for
 winter feed. Another staple crop is   
 potatoes, grown for seed or ware. One 
 farm in this area also cultivates     
 strawberries and raspberries for use  
 mainly by food processing and freezer 
 factories.These latter crops provide  
 seasonal employment during            
 harvesting.Cattle for beef production 
 are grazed on the rougher grass       
 areas.Grass parks are sometimes rented
 out for over wintering of sheep from  
 farms on higher ground. There is one  
 dairy farm in this area.              </content>
