 Shotts lies on the line of the Great  
 Road which from and before Roman times
 has been the main East West route.    
  In the 15th century the road became  
 dangerous due to the activities of a  
 notorious giant highwayman known as   
 Bartram Shotts.A reward was offered by
 King James IV for his capture ,dead or
 alive.                                
   He was ambushed by the young laird  
 of Muirhead as he lay drinking at     
 Kate's Well,named after St.Catherine. 
  The laird hamstrung him as he lay    
 there ,cut off his head and carried it
 to the king.                          
 This story is one doubtful explanation
 for the origin of the name "Shotts".
