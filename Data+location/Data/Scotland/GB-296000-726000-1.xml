		<content> The{River Almond}in its Logie stage,  
 borders this D-block to the North; to 
 the South lies Keillour Forest and to 
 the East Drumbuich Wood: the Western  
 edge is bordered by a 9-hole golf     
 course and some heathland.  The       
 population is about 650 of which 600  
 live and work in the{Glenalmond       
{College}estate. Apart from the        
 scattered farms the College dominates 
 the life of this block and with 380   
 boys and 40 masters it is a           
 male-orientated establishment.        
 Founded in{1847}as a Theological      
 College the school soon evolved into a
{boys' boarding school}and through its 
 facilities and the provision of       
 employment strong links are preserved 
 with the wider community outside of   
 its estate. What follows evaluates    
 College life and its relationship with
 neighbouring farms.                   </content>
