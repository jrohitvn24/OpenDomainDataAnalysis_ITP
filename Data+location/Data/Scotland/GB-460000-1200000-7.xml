		<title>07The Uyeasound Hamefarers.</title>
		<content> The word Hamefarin means Homecoming.  
 The last Hamefarin was in 1960. For   
 the 1985 Hamefarin several people     
 came from all over the world to       
 Uyeasound.I asked one of the          
 Hamefarers a few questions.He had come
 from New Zealand and had not come to  
 the last Hamefarin.Born in Shetland,he
 still has relatives here.He left for  
 employment when he was young and      
 prefers the weather where he lives    
 now.                                  
   Some special events were arranged   
 for the Hamefarers in Uyeasound.There 
 was a Craft Sale where teas were      
 served.There was a guided tour around 
 Muness Castle.One evening some of the 
 Hamefarers flew low over Uyeasound on 
 a pleasure flight.They went to        
 Britain's most northerly point,Muckle 
 Flugga Lighthouse and then rose higher
 to view the whole of Shetland.        </content>
