   Includes telecommunications, postal 
 services, etc, not by computer.       
   Forres has  both telephone and      
 postal services as it is a reasonably 
 large town.  It also has a teletext   
 service.                              
  {POSTAL SERVICE                      
  The main post office in Forres is in 
 the West end but there is a small sub 
 post office at the rear of a          
 newsagents shop, in the east end of   
 the high street.  Each day there are  
 two postal deliveries. One is fairly  
 early, it comes around nine o'clock.  
 There is another delivery which comes 
 at around eleven o'clock.  Parcels    
 are delivered at about twelve o'clock.
  The east end of Forres has a         
 telephone system which is in all      
 houses but there is no telephone      
 exchange at this end.                 </content>
