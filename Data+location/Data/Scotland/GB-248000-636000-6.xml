		<title>06LOUDOUN ESTATE-GALSTON</title>
		<content>  Loudoun Estate was at it's height in 
 the early 19thC when the castle was   
 known as "The Windsor of Scotland".   
  Loudon Estate is mainly covered in an
 extremely deep boulder clay layer.It  
 is this layer not the underlying rock 
 that determines soil type             
 and,unfortunately this boulder clay   
 has produced a very poor soil.        
 Due to bad management of the 1000 acre
 estate down through the years and bad 
 drainage caused by the boulder clay   
 layer,farming on the Loudoun estate is
 not good so the estate could never    
 become profitable on farming alone.   
  The estate can't make good use of    
 it's farmland potential.Instead by    
 opening it's doors to the public it   
 may pave the way to a brighter future.
 It has already well developed clay    
 pigeon and pheasant shoots,nature     
 trails and a horsejumping area.       </content>
