		<content>   The {Red Deer Day Centre}can take   
 up to one hundred patients each day   
 The hospital not only looks after     
 the elderly and the handicapped,but   
 it looks after others in the          
 community too.                        
   An occupational therapy department  
 with specialized"aids to daily        
 living"rooms(bathroom,kitchen and     
 bedroom)and a fully equipped          
 physiotherapy department are in the   
 unit.Chiropody,speech therapy and     
 dental care are some of the other     
 services.There are also several       
 consulting,treatment and recovery     
 rooms. The elderly and disabled-most  
 of whom would not get out of their    
 house much and be lonely-get a chance 
 to chat with each other and play games
 together.A welfare rights officer will
 visit the Centre regularly.
