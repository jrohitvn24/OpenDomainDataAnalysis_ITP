		<title>08Life Styles in our D-block.</title>
		<content> Throughout our D-block people lead    
{different life Styles.}To find out how
 these Life Styles differ we went into 
 the streets of{Bellfield,Shortlees and
{Riccarton}with a list of questions. By
 asking these questions we found out   
 that 45% of the families in our       
 D-block had a{car,}but that 80% of the
 people held a current{driving licence.
 Most of the people use their cars     
 for shopping,going to work and getting
 out and about.The majority of shoppers
 do their shopping at the{supermarkets,
 although about 25% buy necessity items
 at their own{local shops.}At weekends 
 most people stay at home and watch    
{T.V.}Their favourite programmes are   
 Soap Operas. The two most popular     
{newspapers}in our D-block are The     
 Daily Record and The Sun.
