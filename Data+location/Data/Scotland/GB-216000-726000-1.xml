		<title>01A RURAL VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Dalmally is a small rural village in  
 Argyll &amp; Bute Division of Strathclyde 
 Region. The village is situated       
 60miles from Glasgow, our nearest     
 large town is Oban which is 25miles   
 away. When travelling from Glasgow    
 your first sight of Dalmally is from  
 the top of Strone Hill.  From this    
 vantage point Dalmally looks like a   
 small village surrounded by trees. As 
 you get nearer you can see that the   
 area has much land used by the        
 Forestry Commision.  From this initial
 view  the other main land cover is    
 obviously rough grazing for sheep.    
     There are about 300 people living 
 in Dalmally. The village appears to be
 in two parts, a new part consisting of
 houses, a school and a shop.  The     
 older part of the village has fewer   
 house with a Post Office,Garage,a     
 small gift shop and a Railway Station.</content>
