		<content>   The Buchanites settled in this area 
 in 1784, with their founder Mrs Buchan
 from Irvine. In "Buchan Ha" they lived
 according to their extraordinary      
 religious beliefs. They didn't accept 
 marriage; the few children in the     
 community were considered common      
 property and so were given to foster  
 parents, and they believed they would 
 go directly to heaven avoiding death. 
 There was only one dormitory with very
 close beds which led to no privacy and
 promiscuity. To outside observers     
 there appeared to be no natural       
 increase within the Buchanites.       
 Believing that infants had no souls   
 many were drowned at birth. Work was  
 done not for wages but for food to    
 feed their community. The Buchanites  
 were driven out of the district and   
 eventually settled in Crocketford.
