		<title>08CANOEING AND SAILING.</title>
		<content> At Beecraigs Country Park there are   
 good facilities for canoeing and      
 sailing. It is possible to have a     
 single try_out, or to book a course of
 lessons. Courses start at nine a.m.   
 and finish at three p.m.              
 Instructors take people in groups of  
 six.They teach them how to handle the 
 canoe properly. When you are          
 experienced enough you can paddle     
 round the island in the middle of the 
 loch.The island is a bird sanctuary.  
 To learn to sail, two-man dinghies are
 used. First of all you are taught to  
 assemble the mast and rudder.Then the 
 instructors show you how to handle the
 boat.                                 
 At the end of the course a race is    
 organised. It is a very enjoyable kind
 of lesson.
