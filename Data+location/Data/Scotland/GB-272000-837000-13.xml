		<title>13FARMING IN DAVIOT TODAY.</title>
		<content>  The principal breed of cattle in     
 Strathnairn is cross simmental and    
 Aberdeen angus.  There are very few   
 highland cattle nowadays.This is      
 because they only breed every 2 years 
 and do not fatten up as well as other 
 breeds.                               
   Most of the Daviot cattle are for   
 beef production.                      
    {SHEEP.}All the farms have         
 black-face sheep and some also have   
 border leicesters and cheviots.Cross  
 bred lambs are also very common.      
   {CROPS.}Most farms grow as much     
 winter feeding for the animals as they
 can. This is usually hay and          
 turnips.The land is not flat enough   
 for arable farming.Some potatoes are  
 grown.                                
    {HILL LAND.}Much hill land has been
 bought by the forestry for planting   
 with trees.                           </content>
