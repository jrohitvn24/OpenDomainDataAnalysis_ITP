		<title>13A TYPICAL DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content> My week is all the same.All the       
 time,"Your turn to  do the dishes, I  
 did them yesterday." In my family I   
 have one sister (Laura) and my        
 parents.I also have a dog.I get up at 
 seven and then about seven-thirty I   
 have my breakfast.At school we do     
 maths, language, art, gym, activities,
 listen  to the radio or watch TV.We   
 do reading and project.I do lots of   
 gardening after school.In the evenings
 I watch things like "Dallas" and      
 "Dynasty." At weekends I often go to  
 the school park and play with my      
 friends.In the afternoons I go        
 swimming or to gymnastics.Sometimes I 
 go into Aberdeen to shop.             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
