 In 1920 they celebrated Burns' day    
 much the same as now, with dances and 
 suppers etc.                          
{WORK                                  
 Most people worked in factories  such 
 as the thread mills.   Mrs McConville 
 made stockings.   The clothes that the
 women wore were, long skirts and      
 floppy hats with big hat pins.   There
 was a lot of poor people so some      
 people set up  a stall where the poor 
 could go to get some free soup.       
{THEN AND NOW                          
 Mrs McConville said she preferred     
 Dumfries in the 1920's with horses and
 carts more than today's cars and      
 lorries because it is far too busy    
 now.
