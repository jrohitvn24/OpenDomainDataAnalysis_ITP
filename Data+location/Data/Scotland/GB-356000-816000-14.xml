		<title>14Transport in Alford</title>
		<content> The family car is how most travel,    
 though bicycles, motor bikes, buses,  
 taxis  and Shanks  pony are also used.
 A dog sledge was even seen one        
 winter's day! The daily bus service to
 Aberdeen  is adequate but costly.     
 Private companies introduced community
 buses this year linking Alford with   
 the surrounding villages and towns.   
 Alford houses Grampian's Transport    
 museum, opened in 1983,  and showing  
 the development of road transport in  
 Grampian. Special events are held in  
 the arena- the best known being the   
 annual Alford Cavalcade, a vintage    
 vehicle rally held in July. The dis-  
 used station buildings opened again in
 1984 as the Alford Valley Railway     
 museum. From there Scotland's only 2  
 foot gauge passenger railway runs     
 through Haughton and Murray Parks.
