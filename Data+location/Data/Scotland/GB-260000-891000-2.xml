		<title>02OUR COMMUNITY, BONAR BRIDGE</title>
		<content>  The{population}of the area of{Bonar  
{Bridge}ia approximately{600.}It       
 consists of people whose families     
 belong to this area and those who have
 moved here for reasons of work or     
 retirement. There is no one main      
 industry but many are involved with   
 work on the land in one way or        
 another. Other employments are in     
 forestry, services and tourism. Some  
 men were employed in the oil related  
 industries at Nigg but have been out  
 of work since last year, owing to lack
 of orders. It is a busy community with
 a good cross section of age groups,   
 and many activities geared to suit    
 them. It is not particularly remote   
 having the towns of Dornoch and Tain  
 within easy reach and good roads, bus 
 and rail services to Inverness, about 
 an hour's journey away.
