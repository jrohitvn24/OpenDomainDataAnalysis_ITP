		<content> The{Young Ornithologists Club}in      
{Bonar Bridge}is run by two ladies on  
{Saturday mornings.}We come to the     
 school every second Saturday. Each    
 week we study a different bird. At the
 start we have a competition with      
 binoculars. There is a board up at the
 top of the corridor and a table at the
 other end. There are pictures of birds
 on the board and you have to try and  
 name them. Then we are asked what     
 birds we have seen. Then we have      
 juice. After that we play a few       
 games. Then the competition winners   
 get their prizes. There are a lot of  
 people go birdwatching and we all     
 enjoy it very much.
