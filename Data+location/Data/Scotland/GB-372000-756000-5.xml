		<content>    My father's name is Mr B Phillips. 
 His job is at Glaxo Factory. He works 
 different shifts. His part-time job is
 a Fireman. At the back of the station 
 there is a practice tower which is    
 about 25 ft and every Thursday night  
 they put their gear on and have to    
 climb about half way up with the hose.
 This is practice for when any high    
 building is on fire.                  
    My mother's name is Mrs P Phillips.
 Her job is a cleaner. She cleans      
 Balmain Court. The days she works are 
 Monday, Thursdays and Fridays. On     
 Mondays she cleans the windows, on    
 Thursdays she scrubs floor and on     
 Friday she "Hoovers", polishes and    
 cleans the windows of the lounge.     
    My brothers name is Ralph Phillips.
 He is in the army. His regiment is the
 RAOC. He is still in Boy's service,   
 but next year he will be in Men's.    </content>
