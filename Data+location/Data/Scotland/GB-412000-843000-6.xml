		<content> One of the most popular games played  
 in Meethill playground is squares.    
 Squares is a good game which          
 requires good hand control. There is  
 one big square in which there are 4   
 little squares. The squares are       
 numbered 1_4 and a person stands on   
 each square. The person standing on   
 square 4 starts. He bounces the ball a
 few times, then he aims for any  other
 square. When it reaches an opponent's 
 square the opponent is allowed to let 
 it bounce once. Then he tries to      
 bounce it into another square. if he  
 misses it and lets it bounce twice or 
 lets it bounce out of the square he is
 out.Originally this game was taught to
 a group of Peterhead pupils at a      
 school camp by a P.E. teacher from New
 Zealand.
