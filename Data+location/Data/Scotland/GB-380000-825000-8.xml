		<title>08Meldrum and Bourtie Property</title>
		<content> The communities of Meldrum and Bourtie
 have traditionally been linked. They  
 still have right of ownership of      
 certain land on the edge of the town  
 of Oldmeldrum. Gordon District now    
 administers the 25 acre Pleasure Park 
 east of the town, given by an ancestor
 of the present Laird of Meldrum to the
 townspeople.  Today that land is      
 roughly split in three, one third     
 enclosing the Pleasure Park with its  
 soccer and rugby football pitches,    
 tennis courts, bowling green and      
 children's playground; one third forms
 the Golf Course on which stands the   
 erratic boulder, the Groaning Stone;  
 and one third the Feuars' Moss, where 
 residents still have peat rights      
 although peat for fuel is no longer   
 dug. Coal fires heat most homes       
 alongside gas/oil central heating.
