		<title>03THE REV. ALEXANDER POPE</title>
		<content> It was as minister in the parish of   
 Reay that Pope made a name for        
 himself. He was inducted to Reay on   
 5th September  1743 and found his     
 parishioners were "not only ignorant, 
 but coarse in their manners and       
 vicious in their dispositions, and    
 Episcopalians in name but heathens in 
 reality."                             
   To deal with such unruly people the 
 minister adopted methods which would  
 be considered outrageous by any       
 minister today. For instance, he      
 normally carried a stout cudgel with  
 which he protected himself and        
 administered retribution to his       
 rebellious parishioners. As time went 
 on Pope's influence was felt and the  
 tone of the parish was considerably   
 improved.
