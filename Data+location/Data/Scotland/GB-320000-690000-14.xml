 Scotland's Most Famous Duel 1822.     
                                       
 On the farm of Balbarton, one mile    
 east of the village of Auchtertool, on
 a morning in March 1822, Alexander    
 Boswell of Auchinleck was killed in   
 duel.                                 
                                       
 Alexander Boswell, son of James       
 Boswell Biographer and diarist, had   
 inherited some of his Father's        
 literary skill, and he used it to     
 further the Tory cause. Under an      
 assumed name he published slanderous  
 statements concerning his Whig        
 opponents.The main target of his venom
 was his friend James Stuart,- a Whig,-
 who was branded a coward by Boswell.  
 Stuart found out Boswell was the      
 author and promptly challenged him to 
 a duel.                               </content>
