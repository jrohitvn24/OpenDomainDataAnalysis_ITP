 INTO SCHOOL IS SAY OUR PRAYER .NEXT WE
 CHOOSE A BOOK FOR SILENT READING WHILE
 THE TEACHER COLLECTS OUR DINNER MONEY 
 . IT COSTS Â£2.4O FOR ONE WEEK. THEN   
 SOME OF US USE THE SPELLING LAB       
 ,OTHERS DO THEIR WRITING , SOME       
 PEOPLE DO STORIES OR TOPICS AND OTHER 
 PEOPLE DO MATHS OR WORK IN THE SHOP.  
 EVERYBODY HAS A LIST OF WORK TO       
 COMPLETE DURING THE MORNING . THE     
 THREE PEOPLE IN PRIMARY 5 HAVE BEEN   
 DOING A LOT OF WORK ON THE COMPUTER   
 FOR THE DOOMSDAY PROJECT . JUST       
 BEFORE DINNER WE STOP FOR A STORY .12
