		<content>   There used to be many{small crofts  
 with a family having a small amount of
 land around the croft house on which  
 to graze a few animals and raise some 
 food crops.  It was subsistence       
 farming.                              
   To-day almost all of the small      
 crofts have been made into bigger     
 farms, with larger flocks of sheep and
 some cattle.   The lambs are born in  
 spring time, brought on, and then     
 taken to market (usually in Wick) to  
 be sold to farmers in the south. There
 they are fattened up ready for        
 slaughtering for meat.  It is similar 
 for the cattle.                       
   The fields which grow crops mostly  
 grow winter feeds for the animals.    
 Much of the grass is put down for     
 sillage.
