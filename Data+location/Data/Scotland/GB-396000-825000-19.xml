		<title>19Farm Animals in Local Area</title>
		<content> In this area because the soil is so   
 rich it is mainly used for the growing
 of crops rather than the grazing for  
 animals.The grazing land is used      
 mostly for dairy cows and fat cattle  
 to produce good meat and milk.        
 In the Newburgh area the most common  
 farm animals to be found are fat      
 cattle,dairy cows and sheep.Many of   
 the local farms just concentrate on   
 the 1 type of animal and in that way  
 the farm can produce more and better  
 products.                             
 Other types of farm animals you can   
 find in this area are pigs,goats,hens 
 and ponies.Shetland ponies are kept as
 pets for children.Afew farms also keep
 horses for riding.Goats are useful for
 the milk they can produce.Pigs provide
 not just meat but good fertilizer for 
 the land.The hens are free range and  
 are kept for the eggs which they lay. </content>
