		<title>05Cranshaws Castle</title>
		<content> The first record of Cranshaws Castle  
 is in 1350 when the Earls of March    
 owned it. It was passed on to the     
 Swinton family in 1401. After losing  
 possession of it for a few years they 
 regained it in 1412.                  
                                       
 In 1702 David Denham bought it. His   
 son James Denham sold the land to     
 James Watson of Saughton in 1739. Then
 it descended through his mother to    
 Lord Aberdour eldest son of the Earl  
 of Morton. In 1895 it was bought by   
 Andrew Smith of Whitchester and became
 the property of his grand-nephew in   
 1931. It was restored by Mr S E A     
 Landale's uncle in 1896/7. The Castle 
 is still owned today by the Landale   
 Family. It has recently been restored 
 and is in a good state of repair.
