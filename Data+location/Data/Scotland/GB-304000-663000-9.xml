		<title>09HOUSING 2 LIVINGSTON SOUTH</title>
		<content> We did a further survey on housing in 
 square 03050665 questioning parents   
 from{Bankton Primary School,}our      
 school. The most popular housing was  
 terraced. Most of the housing is owned
 by{Livingston Development Corporation.
 It is possible to buy your home and   
 quite a number of people have done    
 so.The average number of people living
 in these houses is 5. The average     
 number of rooms is 6. Good points     
 similar to housing on page 8: Good    
 communication; bright modern housing; 
 nearby amenities;underpasses          
 therefore  no roads to cross;access to
 Edinburgh and Glasgow.                
 Bad points similar  to both areas are:
 dogs fouling gardens;vandalism;no     
 local shops;lack of nearby social     
 facilities.In area 03050665 houses    
 are in close proximity to each other  
 and have few facilities for children. </content>
