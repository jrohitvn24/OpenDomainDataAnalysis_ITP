		<title>18Farming - Creca/Kirtlebridge</title>
		<content> Most of the farms are mixed stock.    
 There are two dairy farms in the area.
 Dairy cows are Holsteins or Freisians 
 with a few Ayrshires. Beef cattle are 
 Dairy breds crossed with Charolais,   
 Limousin and Simmentals. A.I. is used 
 but a Freisian bull is sometimes kept.
 Sheep are Suffolk cross, a few Dorset 
 Horned, a flock of Freisland Milk     
 sheep and a small flock of Jacobs.    
 Grass is the main crop which is cut   
 for silage and hay. Some barley is    
 grown for stock feed. On the wholw the
 land is fertile grassland. There is   
 some rough grazing near Kirtlebridge  
 and wetlands near Quarry Park. The    
 farms do not employ many outside      
 workers, depending on the family.
