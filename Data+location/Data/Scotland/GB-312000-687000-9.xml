		<title>09EDUCATION IN CROSSGATES</title>
		<content>  In{1925}Crossgates High School was   
 opened,but later become a Primary     
 School.There was a second school in   
 Mossgreen and one in Halbeath,But in{ 
{1968}they both closed and pupils went 
 to Crossgates Primary.At one point the
 number of pupils in the school was    
 close to the{300}mark ,but this number
 has dropped to{ 180.}Education wasn't 
 very good,with large classes and not  
 many facilities.                      
  Nowadays the facilities in the school
 have improved a lot.They have 3       
 computers,a language unit for children
 who can't express themselves,a        
 nursery, school doctors ,nurses       
 ,dentists,etc.The school is quite     
 large and is hidden behind houses on  
 the main road.Education has improved  
 with smaller classes and more         
 individual teaching.
