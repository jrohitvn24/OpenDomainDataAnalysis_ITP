		<year>1986</year>
		<title>01District of Sourin, Rousay</title>
		<content> The major part of the block is        
 uncultivated moorland. Within this    
 area there is a rich supply of peat   
 which each household has a traditional
 right to use. Coastwards, a belt of   
 cultivated land is populated by       
 farming families. Beef and sheep      
 farming are undertaken with mostly    
 grass and barley being grown for feed.
 Vast numbers of rabbits are a pest to 
 farmers. There is a market garden. Its
 produce is sold locally and on        
 Mainland Orkney. A salmon hatchery is 
 currently under construction. An      
 electricity sub-station was built in  
 1983. 20 children attend the island's 
 primary school. There are 2 full-time 
 teachers. Children proceed to second- 
 ary school in Kirkwall on Mainland    
 Orkney where they are weekly boarders.
 The school building was extended in   
 1984 to include the Community Centre. </content>
