   Sports facilities are limited but   
 have been improved of late with a     
 sports barn near Eddlewood. There is a
 private Bowling Club in Eddlewood with
 a club attached and a number of foot- 
 ball teams exist, usually for unorgan-
 ised games. There is a Community Cen- 
 tre just outside our area. Most of the
 housing areas lack public houses,     
 which tend to be concentrated on      
 Strathaven Road - but one new pub exi-
 sts and one old one in Meikle Earnock.
{RELIGION}                             
   The area has a large Catholic popu- 
 lation, with two Churches at the edge 
 of the survey. Only one Church of     
 Scotland parish is in the area, with  
 another just outside. The existence of
 two Catholic primary schools confirm  
 the extent of the Catholic population.
