		<title>03BEEF FARMING</title>
		<content>   Most of the land around Uplawmoor is
 upland hill country used for the      
 grazing of cattle or sheep.Very little
 of the land is used for cultivation   
 and that which is is devoted to       
 hay,turnips and potatoes.The hay and  
 turnips are used for cattle-food and  
 the potatoes as cash crops.           
                                       
   The cattle are pratically all beef  
 cattle and are a mixture of           
 Aberdeen-Angus and Hereford. The farm 
 at Lynnhead has all blue-grey cows and
 is the only farm to have a large flock
 of ewes and lambs. Most of the cattle 
 are served by one Charolais bull per  
 farm.East Uplaw Farm sells its        
 new-born calves at the market but     
 Lynnhead keeps the calves for         
 fattening  for one year.
