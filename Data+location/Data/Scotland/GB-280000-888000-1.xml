		<content> This is a coastal block, three        
 quarters of which to the East is sea. 
 Landward, the remaining quarter, from 
 North to South, extends from below    
 Embo Street, to a point below the     
 Dornoch Landing Strip.  A sandy beach,
 stretching the full length of the     
 block, is used by bathers and for     
 angling from the shore.  An inshore   
 rescue boat run by volunteers is      
 stored there.  Land North West, within
 the block, is covered by Royal Dornoch
 Eighteen Hole Championship Golf       
 Course, in process of being extended, 
 covers land in the centre West of the 
 block, alongside of Dorncoh Holiday   
 Caravan Site, part of Dornoch known as
 Bishopfield and part of Dornoch known 
 as Littletown.  A helicopter landing  
 place is situated near the Golf       
 Clubhouse.
