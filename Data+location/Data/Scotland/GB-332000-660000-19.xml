 MY DAY WOULD START AROUND 8.30.I WOULD
 SHARE THE BED WITH MY BROTHERS AND    
 SISTERS.I WOULD PUT MY CLOTHES ON     
 WHICH WERE LONG DRESSES,A PAIR OF     
 BUTTON UP BOOTS AND A PAIR OF LONG    
 SOCKS.I WOULD GET WASHED IN A BIG TUB 
 AS WE DID NOT HAVE A BATH WITH RUNNING
 WATER.FOR BREAKFAST WE WOULD HAVE     
 PORRIDGE.AFTER BREAKFAST WE WOULD     
 LEAVE OUR MINERS COTTAGES TO GO TO    
 SCHOOL.SCHOOL STARTED AT 9.00 WITH A  
 PRAYER AND RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE.THEN WE
 WOULD DO MENTAL ARITHMETIC.AT LUNCH   
 TIME SOME PEOPLE WENT HOME WHILE      
 OTHERS WOULD BRING A PACKED LUNCH     
 WHICH WOULD BE FRUIT,BREAD AND CHEESE.
 AFTER LUNCH WE HAD 15 MINUTES TO PLAY.

 AT 4.00.AT HOME THE TABLES AND CHAIRS 
 WERE MADE FROM OLD FRUIT BOXES.MEALS  
 WERE COOKED OVER AN OPEN FIRE.        </content>
