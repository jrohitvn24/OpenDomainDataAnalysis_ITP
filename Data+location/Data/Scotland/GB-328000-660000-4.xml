		<content> Parduvine is typical of the farms in  
 the centre of our block. To the south 
 the land rises and farming changes to 
 stock rearing, beef cattle and sheep  
 are kept. To the north of Parduvine   
 farm where the land is lower, farmers 
 concentrate on crop-farming. More     
 recently farmers such as Thornton and 
 Capielaw have been planting oilseed   
 rape. This crop is not only pleasing  
 to the eye but it is also very        
 profitable to the farmer,with an      
 average yield of about 30 cwt per     
 acre. Arable farmers find that oilseed
 rape fits well into their rotation    
 pattern. It can be planted immediately
 after the harvest of winter barley,   
 and then it will be harvested the     
 following July. "Oilseed rape takes   
 most of the goodness out of the soil, 
 so it cannot be planted in the same   
 field the following year."Mr Logan.   </content>
