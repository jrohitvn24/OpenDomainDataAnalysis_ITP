		<title>14RHU PRIMARY SCHOOL.</title>
		<content> The responsibility for the provision  
 of education in our area rests with   
 Strathclyde Regional Council and is   
 administered by Dumbarton Division    
 through the Executive Officer Mr.J.   
 Mulgrew.Rhu Primary School has grown  
 from being a small country school to  
 having a present roll of 169 with 6   
 full_time teachers,a flexibility      
 teacher and the Headteacher,Mrs.Welsh.
 The children sit either in social or  
 ability groups and work at their own  
 level.Work covers a wide range of     
 topics and where possible we utilise  
 the local environment to enhance      
 classroom learning.During the school  
 year there is a considerable amount of
 change in pupils as we have families, 
 many of whom are related to the nearby
 Naval Base,that move frequently_only  
 42% of present pupils have been in    
 this school since Primary one.        </content>
