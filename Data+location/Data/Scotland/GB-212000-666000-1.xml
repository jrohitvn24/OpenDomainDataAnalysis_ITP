  The Gaelic name for Toward is{Dughard
   dugh black ,ard height (The Black   
 Height).                              
      Toward is situated on the Cowal  
 peninsula.In and around it is all     
 countryside. It is a peaceful quiet   
 place with rolling hills,trickling    
 burns (streams) and pleasant woods.   
      On Toward hill there are two     
 farms,one dairy and one sheep and     
 beef.                                 
      The woods are mainly deciduous   
 but there are some Pine.The deciduous 
 woods are partly choked with          
 Rhodedendron bushes but are still     
 inhabited by rabbits,other small      
 animals and the occasional Roe deer.  
      The burns flow on curving courses
 from Dughard hill and in Spring you   
 can see young trout going down to the 
 sea.   {Toward cont on page 2.        </content>
