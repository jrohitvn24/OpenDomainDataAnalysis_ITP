		<title>02The Mackintosh of Moy</title>
		<content>   The fragmented nature of the        
 Highlands with its glens divided by   
 mountain barriers gave rise to small  
 scattered communities and largely     
 created the need for the Clan System. 
 STRATHDEARN valley of the Findhorn    
 heartland of the Mackintoshes well    
 illustrates this.                     
  MOY ESTATE has remained in the       
 Mackintosh of Mackintosh  family since
 1336 when the Bishop of Moray granted 
 the Barony of Moy to William 7th Chief
 of Mackintosh.                        
  The original name of the area was    
 STARSACH NA GAL-Threshold of the      
 Highlands. The hills rise around Moy  
 while the ground to the north falls   
 away to the Moray Firth.              
  The present Chief,Lachlan,30th Chief 
 lives in the present Moy Hall. He     
 takes part in public life in the      
 Highlands and was awarded an O.B.E.   </content>
