 Because this freight charge can be    
 high on heavy or bulky items the      
 National Trust for Scotland hire a    
 boat (referred to as the puffer) once 
 a year to bring in all the things that
 would be too expensive on the ferry   
 like coal, wood, cement and bricks.   
 Some sheep and cattle are moved on the
 passenger ferry but in the autumn when
 most animals to be sold are leaving   
 the island a boat is hired to take    
 them to market. This is generally     
 referred to as the cattle boat.
