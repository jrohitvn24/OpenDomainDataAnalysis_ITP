		<title>17RAILWAYS IN THE OAKLEY AREA</title>
		<content> Until{1964}the local railway was used 
 as a{passenger line}.After that it was
 used as a line for carrying coal which
 was taken to{Longannet powerstation   
 from the nearby mines.Since the       
 miners' strike the railway has been   
 closed down completely and lorries    
 carry the coal instead.These lorries, 
 carrying very heavy loads,now pass    
 through the village of{Oakley}very    
 regularly{.The local people are       
{concerned}about them damaging the     
 roads and the vibrations shaking the  
 houses.They are also very worried     
 about the danger to their children.
