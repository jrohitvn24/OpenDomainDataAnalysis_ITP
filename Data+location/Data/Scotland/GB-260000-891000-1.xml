		<title>010UR AREA, BONAR BRIDGE</title>
		<content>{Bonar Bridge}is situated in the       
 southern part of the district of      
{Sutherland}in the{Highland Region.    
 It is on a hilly site reaching from   
 sea level to a height of 160m. It is  
 bordered to the south by the waters of
 the Kyle of Sutherland and the Dornoch
 Firth. The older part of the village  
 lies near the waters' edge while newer
 houses have been built on the hill    
 behind. The village peters out to     
 scattered buildings and crofts        
 reaching northwards. The scenery is   
 beautiful encompassing lochs, rivers, 
 hills, forests and moors.  All are    
 abundant in wildlife. The older houses
 of the village are stone-built and    
 interesting while some of the new     
 command fine views over the Kyle to   
 the mountains beyond. The climate is  
 kind, being drier than most parts of  
 the North.                            </content>
