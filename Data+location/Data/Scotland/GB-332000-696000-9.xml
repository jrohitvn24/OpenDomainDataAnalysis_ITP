		<content> There are two principle roads in this 
 area. The A.915 runs from Kirkcaldy   
 through the area to Windygates. The   
 A.955 parallels the A.915 and serves  
 the villages of East Wemyss, Coaltown 
 of Wemyss and Buckhaven. The A.915 is 
 known as the Standing Stone Road      
 because it passes close to a number of
 standing stones.                      
 There are four bus services which run 
 on the A.915 linking the villages with
 the five major surounding centres;    
 Dundee, Leven, Kirkcaldy, Dunfermline 
 and Edinburgh. There are also a       
 further two services which run along  
 the A.955 providing a slightly quicker
 service between Kirkcaldy and Dundee  
 than the coastal route. Car owner ship
 is low so there is a high dependance  
 on public transport.                  
 Links with the motorway network are   
 poor,thus causing some isolation.     </content>
