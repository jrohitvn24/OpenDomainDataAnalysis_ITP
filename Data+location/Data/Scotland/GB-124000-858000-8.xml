		<content> Children in our community are very    
 good at helping at home and outside   
 the home. Most households have solid  
 fuel fires on which coal,peat and wood
 are burnt. Coal is bought from a local
 supplier. Wood is bought from the     
 forestry commission. Peat,which costs 
 nothing but time and energy, is burned
 by nearly every household. Everyone   
 helps from the cutting,to stacking,to 
 bringing home for fuel. The same      
 applies at sheep-shearing and dipping 
 time. People help each other thus     
 enabling the work to be done          
 quicker. Nearly every family has a    
 cat,a dog or usually both. Life here  
 is much more relaxed than in the town 
 or city. Life is also much healthier. 
 People seem to have more time for each
 other. People here spend a lot of time
 working outside every day.
