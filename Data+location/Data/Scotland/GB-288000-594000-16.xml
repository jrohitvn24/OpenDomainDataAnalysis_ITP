		<title>16Games for Older Children.</title>
		<content> The oldest children in the school     
 choose two games which they liked.    
 These are "othello" and "Monopoly".   
 Monopoly is a board game which the    
 players move around the edge of. The  
 edge is split into boxes. Each box has
 the name of a street or station in    
 London on it and some boxes are       
 grouped together and are the same     
 colour. The player moves around the   
 board after shaking a die and can buy 
 property if he lands on its square.If 
 he lands on a square owned by another 
 player he has to pay him rent. Once a 
 player has bought a group of          
 properties he can buy houses and      
 hotels for it and so charge more rent.
 This game can last a long time and the
 winner is the person who has most     
 property and money.
