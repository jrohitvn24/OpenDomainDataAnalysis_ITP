		<title>04KILDRUMMY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> The earlest records of the school are 
 in the church session records of 1803,
 although these suggest that the school
 had been built prior to that date.    
 At one time there were 90+ pupils, in 
 three classrooms.   The curriculum    
 included latin greek, book keeping and
 Domestic science.   The same          
 building is still used with a small   
 part added and the old part modernised
 and very attractively furnished.   The
 three rooms are now classroom general 
 purposes room and kitchen/ dining     
 room. It can accommodate 19 pupils in 
 the p1-5 range.  The curriculum now   
 includes Art Music Drama P.E and Home 
 Economics.   There is only one full   
 time teacher  At P6 the children      
 traval 7 miles to Alford to complete  
 their education                       
   The general purposes room is hired  
 for meetings.                         </content>
