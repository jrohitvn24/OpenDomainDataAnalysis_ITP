		<content> There has been a great increase in    
 popularity for{bowling}recently. There
 are six bowling clubs in our town but 
 each has a long waiting list of people
 wishing to become members. Mr Alex    
 Herschell,treasurer of{Irvine Winton  
{Bowling Club,}which is over 120 years 
 old,told us that he felt there was a  
 need for a few extra clubs in the     
 town.All of the clubs are private     
 except Irvine Park which has a        
 municipal club.{Membership}of clubs is
 for men and women although women are  
 only{associate members}and do not have
 free use of the green unless special  
 permission is given. Generally they   
 can play on only two or three         
 afternoons per week.{The fee}for{male 
 members is about{Â£20}on average and   
 about{Â£7}for{females.}Bowls cost      
 between Â£70 and Â£100 and flat soled   
 bowling shoes cost from Â£15 to Â£100.  </content>
