		<content> The west half of the block is mainly  
 the glen containing the upper reaches 
 of the River Oykel, which is famous   
 for its salmon fishing although it is 
 not fished in this part. In square    
 02330914, there is a loch which feeds 
 the River Oykel. There is a path by   
 the side of the River Oykel going up  
 to the head of the glen and it        
 branches off beside the tributary from
 Loch Sail an Ruathair. This branch    
 goes a long way north. These paths are
 used often by the keeper at Benmore to
 take home the deer he culls. There is 
 a turf cross at 0234209146, probably  
 used for sheltering sheep. There are  
 also two stalls at 0234309149 and     
 023332509146. Two ruined houses are at
 0233409139 and 0232509146.
