		<content> People like living in this area       
 because of its scenery,peace and      
 quiet,gentle pace of life,friendly    
 folk and the moderate climate(although
 many feel that the weather often has  
 room for improvement!) They feel,     
 however, that there are some          
 disadvantages e.g. a poor bus service,
 no train service,no police station,the
 distance from large shops,the cost of 
 travel to larger centres,the noise of 
 low-flying aircraft from a nearby     
 air-base etc. But most think that     
 these disadvantages are outweighed by 
 the advantages.                       
   Some consider that the area needs   
 new industries to give further        
 employment so that more young people  
 would be able to live here.
