		<title>18LOCHGOILHEAD_EMPLOYMENT</title>
		<content> Lochgoilhead is fortunate in having   
 little unemployment.The people are    
 employed in a surprising variety of   
 jobs.Jobs relating to tourism are the 
 most common.Mr.D.Campbell is the main 
 employer in the area.Many people,not  
 only from Lochgoilhead,are empoled by 
 him in his hotels,building firm,shops,
 bus service,cafe,farm and riding      
 centre. Education,in its widest sense,
 employs quite a few people.(e.g. in   
 the school,the outdoor centre,the     
 scout centre).Some of the villagers   
 are self-employed and some commute to 
 Dunoon or Glasgow.                    
 The Naval Base employs quite a few    
 civilians.Some of the villagers are   
 Servicemen in the Royal Navy or the   
 Merchant Navy.                        
 Some younger villagers had to leave to
 find work but generally Lochgoilhead  
 can be considered fortunate.          </content>
