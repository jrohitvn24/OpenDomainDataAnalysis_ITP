		<title>04GEOLOGICAL SURVEY</title>
		<content>  The rocks in this map area all belong
 to the Carboniferous period. In the SW
 of the area under survey there is     
 approx. 2.5 km2 of limestone.This land
 does not contain coal, but in the past
 was quarried for limestone. The       
 predominate type of rock is limestone 
 containing coal (carboniferous        
 limestone). This covers about 9 km2 of
 the area. Over the past 100_150 years 
 much of this area had a number of     
 small coal mines. Today coal          
 mining is represented by a large      
 opencast development. The             
 sedimentary rocks in this area have   
 been greatly faulted which made mining
 difficult. The Hill of Beath, in the  
 north of the area is made up of       
 agglomerate rock; which is rock formed
 from a mass of volcanic debris,a      
 result of volcanic activity at the end
 of the carboniferous period.          </content>
