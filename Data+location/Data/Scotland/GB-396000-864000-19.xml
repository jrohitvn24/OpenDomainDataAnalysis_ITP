		<title>19The Church in Fraserburgh</title>
		<content>   The original{Old Parish Church,     
 Saltoun Square, was built{1571.}The   
 present building was erected on the   
 same site in 1803 and has been        
 extensively altered inside and out    
 since then. The minister is the       
{Rev.D.Clyne}who is also the{school    
{chaplain}for Fraserburgh Academy.     
   The{Rev.Charles Ferme}was minister  
 in{1598}when he was appointed         
{Principal}of the{University of        
{Fraserburgh,}which sadly only lasted a
 short time.                           
   The town has churches, meeting halls
 and missions of some{12 churches and  
{denominations}which are well supported
 by their congregations.
