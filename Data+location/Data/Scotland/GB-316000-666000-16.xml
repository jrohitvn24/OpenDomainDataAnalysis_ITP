 A child can go into the local chip    
 shop with confidence, because of the  
 friendly service. The chips are       
 excellent and so are the sausages,    
 white puddings, black puddings,       
 haggises, pizzas, chickens and other  
 things, so it has a very good variety.
 Although small, it appears to attract 
 many customers. Other than chips it   
 sells a large variety of sweets, such 
 as Mars Bars and Polos. It also has a 
 wide range of refreshments, one of    
 which is Quatro. Its prices are very  
 competitive. Personally I think that  
 it is in a very good area, because    
 people travelling through Juniper     
 Green can stop and buy some chips and 
 catch up on the latest news from the  
 shop's television. Sometimes too much 
 salt and sauce is given, but all in   
 all it is a very good chip shop.      </content>
