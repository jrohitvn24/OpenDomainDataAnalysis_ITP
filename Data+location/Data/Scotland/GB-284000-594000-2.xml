		<content>   In 1885 the parish of Penpont had 53
 men employed in rural craft industries
 such as blacksmithing and dry stone   
 dyking. Until 1970 Kirkpatrick's of   
 Thornhill ran a bacon and sausage     
 factory which distributed goods       
 throughout Scotland.                  
   Now there is hardly any             
 manufacturing industry left in the    
 area and most people find employment  
 in service industries. Many others    
 must commute to work in Dumfries where
 ICI maintains a large chemical works; 
 UNIROYAL have a rubber factory, and   
 several industrial estates have       
 attracted a variety of smaller        
 industries.                           
   Service jobs have also been lost to 
 the area. Penpont's shops have fallen 
 from 12 last century to only 3 now and
 the area is littered with closed rural
 churches, post offices and schools.   </content>
