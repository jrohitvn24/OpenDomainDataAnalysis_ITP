		<title>12The Voe Water Supply</title>
		<content>                                       
 Gonfirth Loch is situated behind the  
 hill of Sneugie.Most people in Voe get
 their water supply from this loch.    
 Before the water leaves the loch it is
 put through sand filters and chlorus  
 is added to kill any bacteria.        
 The machinery at the loch is checked  
 daily.Occasionally,if something does  
 go wrong the Waterboard men are called
 out to do repairs.If for any reason   
 the water supply has to be stopped    
 from reaching the houses then a valve 
 is turned.                            
 Sometimes the loch freezes up and the 
 ice can be up to four inches thick.   
 However,there has never been a water  
 shortage because the loch gets more   
 water from springs underneath it.     
 Gonfirth Loch is one of the highest   
 lochs in Shetland.
