		<title>20HALMOSS FARM</title>
		<content> Mr.Will,a farmer in Inverugie owns    
 Halmoss Farm,and he kindly told us a  
 bit about it.He has approx.250 head of
 cattle,about 80 of which produce      
 milk.There are 65 acres of winter     
 barley,20 of turnips,45 oil seed      
 rape,105 wheat and 20 acres in        
 fallow.Sometimes he keeps sheep,but at
 the time we interviewed him,he did not
 have any.It is mainly a dairy farm_   
 meat is only a by_product.When the    
 milk leaves the farm,it goes to       
 retail.It can be sold from the farm or
 it can go to a dry dairy or to the    
 Milk Board,where it is made into      
 butter,skimmed milk,cheese and many   
 other dairy products.Because of       
 sophisticated new machinery,there are 
 now only 5 people employed on the     
 farm,whereas a few years ago,there    
 were 13.
