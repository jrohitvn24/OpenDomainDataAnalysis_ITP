		<title>03Education in Colmonell</title>
		<content> The only educational establishment in 
 Colmonell at present is the village   
 primary school.                       
 As the village population has declined
 so too naturally has the school roll. 
 At present there are only 11 pupils in
 the school,although this would appear 
 to be on the increase.                
 There is only one full time member of 
 the teaching staff,the Headmaster,and 
 he is responsible for the education of
 all the pupils at the school whose    
 ages range from 5 to 12 years of age. 
 The children enjoy a wide range of    
 educational activities and also take  
 part in a rambling club and a sports  
 club after school hours.              
 At the age of 12 the pupils transfer  
 to Girvan Academy,some 12 miles away. 
 They are transported to Girvan by the 
 local community bus.
