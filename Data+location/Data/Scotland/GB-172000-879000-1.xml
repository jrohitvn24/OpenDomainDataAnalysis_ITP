		<title>01Land area around N. Erradale</title>
		<content>  This is a moorland area with hills   
 running down to the sea.  It has one  
 single track road with passing places 
 with one road off to North Erradale.  
 There is a garage and workshop.  Many 
 of the houses have extensions and run 
 a Bed and Breakfast service.  The     
 Highlands and Islands Development     
 Board gave grants for the extensions. 
 Other houses appear to be used solely 
 as holiday houses.  Although most of  
 the old crofts have been abandoned and
 became ruins there are still a few    
 flocks of sheep kept on the rough     
 grazing area.  The soil is made up of 
 areas of peat, bog and moorland.  Most
 of the land is used for rough grazing.
