 by two brothers called Bobby and Tommy
 about{36 years ago.}Now it is a very  
 well known travelling circus.It has 60
 employees who range from artistes to  
 tradesmen such as electricians.They   
 have 30 animals but some were at      
 Blackpool. It takes time and patience 
 to train them we were told.{The Big   
{Top}which used to be made of canvas is
 now{plastic}and made in{Italy.}It can 
 hold up to 3000 spectators.The touring
 season is from{March-December}with 2  
 months break. The circus has had a    
{permanent}school{teacher}for 18 mths.

 The most popular days are the first
