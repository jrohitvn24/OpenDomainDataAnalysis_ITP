		<title>17GOLF COURSE</title>
		<content> The St Michaels Golf Course is a quiet
 9 hole golf course, which is situated 
 just outside Leuchars.  There is a    
 Club House where members can go and   
 use the facilities.  For senior       
 members there is a pub, and for other 
 members there is a darts board, an    
 arcade, and a small putting-green.    
 You can buy meals and snacks in the   
 pub if you feel hungry after a round  
 of golf which would cost Â£3.00 for    
 adults and Â£1.50 for children, that's 
 if your not a member.  The membership 
 fee for a male is Â£90 and for a       
 female it is Â£70, but for a child it  
 is Â£20.  The course is quite long at  
 4804 yards for a 9 hole course, but is
 a pleasant course to play.
