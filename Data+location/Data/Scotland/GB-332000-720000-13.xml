		<content> IN THE{BRUNTON}AREA HARDLY ANY ONE    
 WOULD LIKE A{POLICE MAN}IN THE AREA   
 USUALLY BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT SINCE 
 THEY ARE LIVING IN THE{COUNTRY}IT IS  
 PEACEFUL AND THERE IS NO NEED FOR     
 ONE.IN{CREICH}THERE IS A{POLICE MAN.  
{ABOUT TWO THIRDS}OF THE PEOPLE IN THE 
 BRUNTON AREA HAVE HAD SOMETHING{STOLEN
{OR HAD SOME CRIME}COMMITTED NEAR      
 THEM.GENERALLY SPEAKING, HOWEVER THE  
 CRIME RATE IN OUR AREA IS VERY LOW    
 COMPARED WITH THAT IN THE TOWN.{
