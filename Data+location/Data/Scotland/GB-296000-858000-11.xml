		<title>11THE LEGEND OF CULBIN</title>
		<content> Once there was a laird who lived in   
 the Culbin Estate and spent his time  
 drinking and gambling.One stormy      
 Saturday night he was playing cards   
 with his friends.At midnight his      
 friends warned him it was the Holy Day
 when no one was to work or gamble but 
 he swore it meant nothing to him.He   
 would keep on playing even if his     
 partner was the Devil.A loud          
 thunderclap was heard and a ghostly   
 light was seen in the chimney.Out came
 the Devil.He welcomed the laird and   
 sat down at the table.They played     
 on.Time passed and the Laird never    
 noticed the time going by or the storm
 outside.The sands piled up and by     
 morning there was no sign of the      
 mansion or the Laird.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
