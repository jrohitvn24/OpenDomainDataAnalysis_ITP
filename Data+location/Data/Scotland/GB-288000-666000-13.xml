		<title>13Criticisms of Blackridge</title>
		<content>    One of the most obvious{criticisms 
 of Blackridge is the{bings.}These     
 have been left from the coal mining   
 days.Before they started to take      
 them away lots of people got{injured  
 because of the hot ash under the gum. 
 They spoil the{landscape.}There are   
 big pools of water down at the bottom 
 and the children can think it is      
 shallow and go in paddling.           
    Another problem about Blackridge is
 that there is too much vandalism.     
 In Blackridge the phones used to get  
 vandalised frequently but now         
 Blackridge has got new{vandalproof    
 phones.                               
   People write their names on walls,  
 roofs, phone boxes and bus shelters.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
