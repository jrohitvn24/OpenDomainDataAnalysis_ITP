		<title>15DUNNET'S COACHES</title>
		<content> Dunnets Coaches began transporting    
 goods and passengers over a century   
 ago. Their fleet of coaches is a      
 feature of the village, being garaged 
 in the centre of the village.  A small
 number of local people are employed as
 drivers and mechanics.  Pupils for    
 various schools,including Wick High,  
 Bower, Watten, Keiss, and Canisbay,   
 are carried by Dunnets.               
                                       
   Periodic services to Inverness are  
 made, and parties are taken further   
 afield, including the Continent. It is
 usually possible to obtain the use of 
 a bus at short notice.                
                                       
   The regular bus services between    
 Wick and John O'Groats are carried out
 by this firm, there being four return 
 services each day - two in the        
 morning, and two in the afternoon.    </content>
