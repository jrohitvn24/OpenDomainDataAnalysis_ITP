{     A FAREWELL FROM CARDROSS.        
 WE HAVE MADE OUR CONTRIBUTION         
 TO DOMESDAY '85,                      
 ASKING QUESTIONS, DOING SURVEYS,      
 HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ALIVE?            
 WE HAVE LOOKED AT HOW WE TRAVEL,      
 WHAT WE EAT AND WHAT WE DRINK,        
 WE'VE TALKED OF NUCLEAR BASES -       
 WHAT DO PEOPLE REALLY THINK?          
 WELL, IT'S OVER AND IT'S DONE WITH,   
 WITH MUCH SWEAT AND BLOOD AND TEARS.  
 WILL PEOPLE REALLY READ ALL THIS      
 IN ANOTHER THOUSAND YEARS?            </content>
