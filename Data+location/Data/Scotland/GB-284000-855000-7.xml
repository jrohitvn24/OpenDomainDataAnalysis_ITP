		<content> Nairn Golf Club started as a          
 gentlemens'club in 1887. No ladies    
 were allowed in the clubhouse unless  
 the temperature fell below -3'C.      
   There are two courses: an 18        
 hole,par 72 (6540 yards)and a 9 hole  
 course called the Newton.             
   The course attracts 5000{visitors   
 and more than 1000 members who each   
 pay Â£100 each year.                   
   The course has had a few major      
{tournaments}e.g. the British Ladies   
 Amateur Tournament and the Mens       
 Scottish Amateur Trophy. The Northern 
 Open is being held here in its        
 centenery year 1986.                  
   The pro-shop sells mainly balls and 
 putters selling 4-5 dozen balls daily.
   The main problem with the course is 
 that the{sea}is slowly{eroding}it.    
{Coastal protection}has already been   
 done but there is still a danger.     </content>
