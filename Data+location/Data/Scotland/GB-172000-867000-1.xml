		<title>01Coastline South of Gairloch</title>
		<content> Landscape: Rocky coastline, with two  
 sandy bays N. &amp; S. of Redpoint. Inland
 the undulating Moor rises to 180m in  
 East.                                 
 People: Redpoint is a very small      
 community at the end of the road.There
 are no shops. Visitors come to enjoy  
 the sandy bays and the views across to
 the Isle of Skye.                     
 Redpoint Farm is pastural, mainly     
 sheep, a few cows and goats. Several  
 young people are trying to make it pay
 but it is very light sandy soil and   
 very isolated. The men have other jobs
 (eg Forestry Commision) and work the  
 farm in their spare time.             
 SE of Red Point on the edge of Loch   
 Torridon is an abandoned fishing      
 station. It is only used as a store   
 for fishermens gear now, or as a      
 shelter for hikers on their way to the
 youth hostel further south.           </content>
