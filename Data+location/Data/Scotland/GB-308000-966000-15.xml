 the Swimming Pool. It was opened 18   
 years ago in 1967. Here are some      
 details.The pool is 27 yards long and 
 10 yards wide. There are 64 000       
 gallons of water in the pool.In the   
 shallow end it is 3ft and in the deep 
 end it is 6ft. In the summer and      
 winter there are different            
 temperatures. There are 5 long rafts  
 and 2 round rafts. The diving board is
 6m high and 2m long. There is only 1  
 person allowed on the chute at a time.
 On Sundays there are an average of    
 50_60 people with armbands which help 
 them learn to swim. There are more    
 males than females in the Swimming    
 Pool all through the week. There are  
 about 200_250 under school age        
 children who use the pool on the week 
 days. There are about 300 people in   
 six hours on Sundays.                 </content>
