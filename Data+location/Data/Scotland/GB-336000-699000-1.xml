		<content> Our area is in Fife on the east of    
 Scotland in the midland belt.It       
 includes Leven and Methil which lie at
 the mouth of the River Leven where it 
 flows  into the Firth of Forth.They   
 form part of a group of towns known as
 Levenmouth.                           
           Leven  lies on the N.E side 
 of the river.There was once a natural 
 harbour here but extensive silting up 
 occured,land reclamation took place   
 and now houses, shops and a car park  
 lie where ships used to berth.        
      Methil lies on the S. side of the
 river and was created as a port in    
 1869.                                 
    The combined population of the two 
 is approximately 27000 people.        
     Lying 55 kilometres  N.NE of      
 Edinburgh there is easy access to both
 larger towns and open countryside.
