		<content>   Cairndow is a wee place.It has two  
 farms,a sawmill, a church and a       
 school.Only about 80 people live in   
 Cairndow.There are only three pupils  
 in our school.                        
   The houses in Cairndow are beside   
 Loch Fyne. Most of the land is used   
 for farming sheep and cattle.         
   Cairndow has very pretty gardens and
 also has the tallest tree in Britain. 
 The tourists visit the church because 
 of its peculiar shape.                
   There is a very steep hill called   
 the Rest and Be Thankful and in the   
 winter it is usually blocked with snow
 and lots of people get stuck on it.   
 They have to be escorted down by the  
 Police.                               
   Cairndow is a quiet peaceful place.
