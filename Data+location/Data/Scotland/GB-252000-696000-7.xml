		<title>07OCCUPATIONS IN GARTMORE</title>
		<content>   The Billet family have been{joiners 
 for 3 generations, since 1910. Most of
 their wood comes from abroad. They    
 mostly do repairs to houses in the    
 villages around Gartmore, but they    
 have built new houses. Tools have     
 changed drastically and they use      
 modern equipment and some standard    
 factory-made fitments. The village    
 joiner has always been the{undertaker,
 a difficult job when he knows many of 
 the people who have died.             
   Mr Whitelaw has been an{electrician 
 for 50 years. He was apprenticed at 14
 and has since worked in the village   
 and about the area. He mostly does re-
 wiring houses. One of his first jobs  
 was fitting strip lights in the       
 school.                               
   Mr Matheson has been a{builder}for  
 13 years, building extensions and     
 porches and fitting in windows.       </content>
