		<title>14GAMEKEEPING</title>
		<content>  Mr.McHutcheon the gamekeeper of      
 Dunecht estate,breeds game birds.The  
 main part of his job is breeding      
{French partridges.}The first stage in 
 the proceed of hatching the eggs is to
 put them in an incubator for 21 days  
 then the eggs are put in a hatching   
 machine for a further 3 days.The      
 hatching machine has  to be kept      
 closed for the full 3 days and the    
 humidity has to be kept high otherwise
 the inside of the eggs will go like   
 leather and the chicks will not be    
 able to peck their way out and they   
 will die.                             
 French partridges are the main birds  
 reared from eggs as there is a much   
 higher recovery rate.10,000 eggs are  
 put into incubation and it is hoped   
 that at least 7000 eggs will hatch and
 survive.                              
                                       </content>
