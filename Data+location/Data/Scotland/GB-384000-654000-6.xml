		<content> There are 2 grain stores at           
 Craigswalls near Chirnside. There they
 store wheat, barley, oilseed rape and 
 peas for farmers from Northumbria and 
 the Borders. Grain can be stored for  
 between 6 and 11 months in the 12     
 sheds. The most important visitor to  
 the stores has been the Queen who was 
 most impressed. Sixty thousand tons of
 grain can be stored at any one time.  
 In the future there will be more sheds
 built to cater for an increased demand
 for the grain storing facilities.     
 Outside Chirnside there is a very busy
 sawmill. Wood for the sawmill comes   
 from forests in the south-east of     
 Scotland and north-east England. Once 
 at the sawmill, the wood is cut and   
 treated by a special process and then 
 goes to be used for pallets and       
 fencing.                              
                                       </content>
