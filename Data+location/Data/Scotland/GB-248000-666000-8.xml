		<content> Renfrew Gala Week is normally held in 
 the first week in June and is         
 coordinated by the Community Council. 
 One of the first events is the Junior 
 Miss Renfrew Contest organised by     
 Renfrew High School. Contestants come 
 from Primary 7 and Secondary 1 and 2. 
 The winner is the Gala Queen whose    
 duties include heading the Gala Parade
 and opening the Babcock Fete. Other   
 events are a Pet Show, a Girl Guide   
 Gang Show, a Badminton Competition, a 
 Five-a Side Football Competition, a   
 Bowling Competition, a Swimming Gala, 
 and a "Scouterama"held by local       
 Scouts. The library organises         
 competitions and the YMCA organise a  
 very popular 'Fun Run' covering 10    
 miles and involving nearly 300        
 runners. The closing event is the Gala
 Dance organised by the Community      
 Council.                              </content>
