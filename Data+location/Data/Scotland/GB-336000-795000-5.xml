		<content> Colin &amp; Mandy own &amp; run a small Inn in
 Ballater. They live outside the       
 village;where they grow a wide range  
 of fresh food.                        
 "Day starts 6.30ish,children run down 
 to play, Colin gets ready for work.   
 Can't linger in bed, hens to feed,    
 lettuces &amp; herbs to pick, beds to     
 make...Too soon its 9.20 - drive our  
 bumpy track then 3+miles to Ballater. 
 Rory,5, dropped at playgroup(as       
 treasurer there may be fees to        
 collect)- off to Inn with Jamie,2;    
 deliver vegetables,do some gardening. 
 Quick cup of coffee, collect Rory &amp; go
 home. Dog demands dinner, busy hour of
 getting lunch,tidying up. Rory        
 collects eggs from our 9 hens. Colin  
 returns on motorbike at 2.30, reports 
 busy time at Inn. Typical lunch: home 
 made soup, grilled rainbow trout, home
 made apple pie. 2 hours gardening."   </content>
