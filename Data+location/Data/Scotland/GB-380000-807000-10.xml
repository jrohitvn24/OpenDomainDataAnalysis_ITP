		<title>10Public Buildings in Westhill</title>
		<content> Westhill is a{community}of 8,500      
 people but has very few public        
 buildings given the size of the       
 population.There are only 11 public   
 buildings.They are the two churches,  
 Westhill Academy,Westhill and Crombie 
 Primary Schools,and community centre, 
 library,play school,public            
 conveniencies,scout hut and Ashdale   
 Hall.                                 
 The Ashdale Hall is used for many     
 community functions including         
 dancing,coffee mornings and public    
 meetings to discuss matters of        
 importance to local residents.        
 The library is the most popular       
 because people don't have to travel 12
 kilometres to Aberdeen and because the
 library has a wide variety of books   
 and records.                          
 Kirkton of Skene Church is our Parish 
 Church;Trinity Church was built in 83.</content>
