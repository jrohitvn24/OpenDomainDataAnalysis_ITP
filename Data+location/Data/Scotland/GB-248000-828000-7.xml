		<title>07FASHION AROUND DRUMNADROCHIT</title>
		<content> It is probably true to say that       
{Drumnadrochit}follows fashion rather  
 than creates it. Most girls buy at    
 least one magazine which helps them   
 keep up to date with fashion and      
 beauty. The most{popular magazines    
 purchased are Jackie, Patches, Blue   
 Jeans, Smash Hits for the girls but   
 the boys buy motorbike and  car mags. 
 Where{clothes}are concerned most      
 people wear down to earth clothes.    
 They don't want to wear anything to   
 way out incase people dislike them.   
 During the day most girls wear jeans  
 and a jumper and trainers, but at a   
 disco they wear mini skirts or baggy  
 trousers and a top. Most girls like to
 wear make up when they go out at      
 night. There is no school uniform,    
 girls wear skirts,jumpers or tops and 
 court shoes. Boys wear trousers and   
 jumpers but out of school wear jeans .</content>
