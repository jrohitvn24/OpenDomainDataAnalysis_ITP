 basis.The {Tourist }trade has         
 attracted business into the town like 
 Scotland Direct formerly based at New 
 Lanark.Scotland Direct with its       
 involvment in thimbles and Gourmet    
 foods can be reckoned to be a major   
 employer.The preliferation of Hotels  
 and cafes in the town also reflect the
 importance of Tourism.There are a     
 number of shops like groceries ,which 
 reflect the fact that Biggar is       
 essentially an important centre for   
 the local farming community.Generally
