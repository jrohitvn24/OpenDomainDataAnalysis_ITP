   There is a Playgroup in Shawhead    
 Village Hall. There are 12 children   
 who go to it aged between 2 and 5     
 years.                                
                                       
   There is a playleader and a helper  
 too. The mothers help on a rota and 2 
 primary school children help as well. 
                                       
   At the playgroup there is sand,     
 water and playdough. There is painting
 to do and making things. At 10.30am   
 the children have milk and a biscuit  
 and a story.                          
                                       
   After that they play with the bikes,
 games, trampoline and the tunnel.
