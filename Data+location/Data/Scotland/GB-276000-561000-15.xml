		<title>15A Day at the Printers</title>
		<content> David Stirling, Laura Harbinson,      
 Claire Setz and Susan Miskimming,     
 first year pupils at Castle-Douglas   
 High School, visited McElroy the      
 Printers. McElroy employs 5 people;   
 two women and three men. All the men  
 and women use the computers, the      
 machines and do the actual printing on
 paper. There are numerous modern      
 machines. Photographs are developed in
 the Dark Room. Mr Hair likes to use   
 the older printing machine but the    
 other two men prefer the modern       
 machines. There is a disc driven      
 computer which collects and stores    
 information. They have 2 floppy discs 
 which contain very valuable           
 information. They are the only 2 of   
 their kind in the world. McElroy hope 
 nothing ever happens to them.
