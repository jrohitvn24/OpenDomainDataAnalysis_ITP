  The first of the two farms which we  
 studied in Chapelhall was Craigends.  
                                       
  This farm owned all its 181 acres of 
 land and concentrated solely on dairy 
 farming.                              
  Their livestock included, sheep and  
 cattle of which there were four types:
 AYRSHIRE and FRESIAN,both of which    
 were dairy cattle, and were milked    
 twice a day, first at 6.00am and again
 at 4.00pm: and LIMIZEENS which is a   
 French                                
 breed,and HERREFORDS. Both are beef   
 cattle.                               
  The type of soil of the farm was     
 partly heavy, and it only grew hay and
 silage.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
