		<title>01The Land of the Homies</title>
		<content> This area consists mainly of sea.  In 
 the sea there are mainly common seals 
 who bask on the rocks.  Lingaholm is a
 small island with Homie sheep living  
 on it.  They receive the name 'Homies'
 as they live on holms.  This sheep    
 were brought over from North Ronaldsay
 and bred here.  Heather also grows on 
 the island and there is a loch where  
 the Homie sheep can get a drink.  On  
 the island there are two old houses,  
 ruins now.  Nobody has lived on the   
 island for many years.
