		<content>  When trees largely replaced sheep the
 population of Eskdalemuir fell        
 gradually, shepherds cottages became  
 holiday houses or homes for the       
 retired .                             
  The school roll fell from an average 
 of forty pupils to the present all    
 time low of eleven children.          
  Eskdalemuir school provides a        
 suitable curriculum for all stages of 
 primary educationcovering subjects    
 such as number and mathematical       
 relationships, spoken and written     
 expression, reading ,environmental    
 studies.Also art and craft music and  
 physical education.There are lessons  
 for recorder guitar and piano.        
  Emphasis is placed on the aquisition 
 of basic skills of literacy and       
 numeracy ,but the broader aspects of  
 personal developement are of          
 considered  equally important.        </content>
