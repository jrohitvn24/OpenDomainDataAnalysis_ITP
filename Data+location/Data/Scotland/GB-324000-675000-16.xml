		<title>16MY WORRIES- by today's child</title>
		<content> It is a pity that you go to football  
 matches these days scared of the      
 violence there could be after it.     
                      {(boy,9years)}   
 What frightens me is all the          
 kidnapping of children.  It isn't very
 nice to switch on the television and  
 find that another child has been      
 kidnapped or been found murdered.     
                      {(girl,9years)}  
 I worry about nuclear missiles and    
 what would happen if one of them was  
 fired.               {(boy,10years)   
 I worry about schools being broken    
 into at the weekends.{(girl,10years)  
 I'm worried about vandalism which     
 older people do just to act big.      
                     { (girl,9years)   
 I worry about strangers.  I always run
 when I am told to go and get my little
 brother from another house.
