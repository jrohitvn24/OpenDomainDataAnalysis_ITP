		<title>10Hillhead Farm.</title>
		<content>  Mr Mustard the farmer at Hillhead    
 Farm owns 360 acres of land, 100 acres
 of barley, 20 acres of turnips and the
 rest is grass. He has 200 cattle. He  
 usually buys the cattle when they are 
 one year old. He fattens them for one 
 year and then sells them to the       
 slaughter house at the age of two.    
 There are 3 tractors on the farm which
 cost around Â£14000.                   
  Mr Mustard said that to become a     
 farmer you have to have a wide        
 education, know a lot about chemicals 
 and you have to be an early riser. The
 hours he works are 07.30 to 17.00. He 
 also works as many days as he needs   
 to. Mr Mustard has been a farmer for  
 10 years and really enjoys the        
 physical work out doors.He has a sheep
 dog which sometimes bites so it gets  
 locked in the car when visitors come.
