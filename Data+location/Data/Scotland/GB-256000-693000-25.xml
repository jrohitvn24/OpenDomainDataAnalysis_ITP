<content>

Since the last survey in 1986 the following changes in the housing stock have occurred:&lt;br />&lt;br />At the end of the 1980s a development of 15 private houses took place at the east end of the village, subsequently named Baron Court. This was a mix of bungalows and a couple of houses each with harled finish and tiled roofs. Each had a garage, lounge, dining room, kitchen and bathroom but a variable number of bedrooms. &lt;br />&lt;br />Early in the 1990's the property that had been the old Station Hotel and had stood empty for many years was converted into five small terraced cottages. On the ground floor there is a living/dining area, a kitchen and narrow entrance hall, while on the second floor there are two bedrooms and a bathroom. This development on the corner of Whiteleys Road and Main Street is known as Garyvard.&lt;br />&lt;br />A short distance from this development on Whiteleys Road, two private bungalows were built at about the same time, on ground that had been used for gardens.&lt;br />&lt;br />The next major change to the housing stock occurred between 1996 and 1997, with the first phase of the extension of Montgomery Place when a mix of under forty social and private housing units were erected.&lt;br />&lt;br />In 2005 work started on phase two of the above when a further fifty or so social housing units were added to the housing stock.&lt;br />&lt;br />   &lt;br />
