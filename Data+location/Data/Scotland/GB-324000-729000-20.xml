		<title>20PITMIDDLE NEAR ABERNYTE</title>
		<content> Pitmiddle was once a village in the   
 S.W.of the area on the southern       
 slope of Pitmiddle Hill.In 1985 all   
 that is left are the remains of 8     
 houses and some old furniture.The     
 paths are and gardens are overgrown   
 and the cattle wander on the hillside 
 The main jobs were at one time        
 farming on small crofts,looking after 
 cattle and weaving (before Dundees    
 mill was built).One Custom was when   
 cows were taken to graze on the hill a
 boy blew a horn and 20-30 cows were   
 unchained and herded onto the hill.   
 Once the motor car was invented roads 
 gradually became better but the road  
 to Pitmiddle was never made up and by 
 1945 the last people began to move    
 away.Today Pitmiddle attracts many    
 tourists looking for the ruined       
 village going there for walks and     
 picnics on the hill.                  </content>
