		<content> This is a very central area of        
 Stronsay and includes many special    
 features, such the old mill. It used  
 to make oats and bere. The mill used  
 to run on water but is now sadly      
 closed because none of the farmers    
 make these produce any more. Another  
 feature of this area is the shores    
 which have creamy clean sand          
 and varieties of underwater creatures.
 We also have shop,church, post office,
 a community center which is also used 
 for dances etc and a burial ground.   
 The community is mainly farming and   
 fishing.
