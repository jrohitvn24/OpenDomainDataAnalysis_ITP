		<content>    Every year during the summer       
 holidays there is a Festival Week.    
 This year it is being held on the 11th
 of August till the 17th of August,    
 1985.                                 
    During the week there are games and
 open air discos for children.There is 
 also a Pageant held at Lindores Abbey,
 where members of the theatre group    
 take part. The opening of the festival
 last year was held at the bottom of   
 Mugdrum Park which had a miniature    
 train and the fire engine was on      
 display. The Army was also there      
 displaying their dogs.                
   One of the events held during the   
 Festival Week is a Pram Race in which 
 people dress up as babies and run     
 through the streets pushing prams and 
 visiting the pubs. A Festival Queen is
 chosen at the first disco. There are  
 also many other activities.           </content>
