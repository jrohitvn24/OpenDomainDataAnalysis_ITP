		<content> This block is south facing,           
 overlooking Pitlochry and the Tummel  
 Valley, with farmland at the bottom,  
 plantations (mainly coniferous) on the
 middle slopes, and heather moorland,  
 used for sheep grazing and grouse     
 shooting, on the upper slopes.   There
 are two mansion houses, Baledmund and 
 Balnakelly, which have belonged to the
 same families for centuries.   There  
 is an ancient standing stone in the   
 field below Baledmund.   There is a   
 public footpath to Ben Vrackie.       
 Pitlochry golf course is in square    
 number 10.   In the coniferous woods  
 there are rocky crags, one of which   
 (Cragower) is a view point belonging  
 to the national trust for Scotland.   
 The old village of Moulin has a small 
 square with church and inn and a local
 sub post office shop, also a bowling  
 green.                                </content>
