		<content>   The Alloway, Doonfoot and Seafield  
 zones of Ayr, close to the            
 countryside, are mainly residential.  
 Housing is mostly private and         
 detached. Many inhabitants commute to 
 Irvine, Kilmarnock and Glasgow. The   
 River Doon meanders down to the sea   
 where the thriving Ayr Bay Sailing    
 Club is situated. Tourists throng to  
 Burns' Cottage and to the Auld Kirk of
 "Tam o'Shanter" fame. The Land o'     
 Burns' Centre gives information about 
 the Burns' Heritage Trail.It is a high
 amenity area with fine recreational   
 facilities. At Seafield and Belleisle 
 there are 18 hole golf courses and at 
 Cambusdoon we find Ayr Cricket and    
 Hockey clubs. Within Rozelle Park is  
 the Maclaurin Art Gallery. Adjacent   
 to the busy public library is Alloway 
 Primary School with over 400 pupils.
