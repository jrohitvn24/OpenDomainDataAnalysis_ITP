		<title>09LONGFORGAN - CHURCH -</title>
		<content> The Church which occupies a prominent 
 site in the village of Longforgan is  
 the descendant of the Church believed 
 to have been established nearly 1400  
 years ago by Modwenna a disciple of   
 St.Patrick. Today it is not only a    
 place of worship where 30%-40% of the 
 community gather Sunday by Sunday but 
 it is a focal point for community     
 activities during the week.           
 Accommodation is provided for 6 youth 
 organisations, the Women's Guild,     
 Senior Citizens and other groups from 
 time to time. It was due to the       
 interest of the minister and the      
 congregation, that a 'Meals on Wheels'
 service was established. Visits to    
 hospitals can be arranged and carried 
 out by the Elders. Longforgan shares  
 its minister with 3 other parishes in 
 the district, thus keeping open some  
 very fine country Churches.           </content>
