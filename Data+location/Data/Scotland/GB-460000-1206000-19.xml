		<title>19Local Weddings</title>
		<content> One unusual custom here concerns local
 weddings. Weddings usually take place 
 on a Friday starting at 5pm. Sometimes
 if the weather is good, the bridal    
 party and guests walk in procession   
 from the Church to the Hall where     
 there is a meal. Guests often number  
 two or three hundred. All the food is 
 provided by the bridal pair's family  
 even the flour for baking the bannocks
 or buns. However people are asked to  
 'take a table' and provide dishes,    
 cutlery etc for say 10 people as well 
 as bake the bannocks. A dance follows 
 often lasting until 5am with short    
 drink and supper breaks. There is     
 usually a second night of dancing, and
 for closer relations often a third    
 night for clearing up the Hall which  
 is specially decorated for the        
 occasion.                             
                                       </content>
