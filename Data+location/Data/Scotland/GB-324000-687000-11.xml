		<title>11THE TANNERY, KINGHORN (1)</title>
		<content> Just to the north of Kinghorn is the  
 town's only manufacturing industry,   
 Kinghorn Tannery. This factory        
 provides employment for 120 people,   
 and processes hides from all over     
 Scotland. The hides and sheepskins are
 brought to the tannery for sorting,   
 grading, weighing, trimming and       
 preservation prior to their eventual  
 sale.                                 
 The British Standards are used to     
 grade the hides according to weight   
 and quality. Selected sheepskins are  
 selected and used to manufacture      
 sheep- skin rugs, and the others are  
 sold for conversion into shammy       
 leathers or sheepskin garments. The   
 bovine hides are sold to finishing    
 tanners, and it would probably,       
 therefore, be more accurate to        
 describe the factory as a{fellmongery}
 rather than a tannery.                </content>
