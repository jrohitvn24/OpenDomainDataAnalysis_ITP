		<title>01The Ascrib Islands</title>
		<content>                                       
 South Ascrib is the main island in a  
 group lying in Loch Snizort between   
 Uig and Waternish. Bare, treeless,    
 uninhabited, they are a home for seals
 and seabirds, puffins, guillemots,    
 kittiwakes, razorbills, common gulls, 
 black-backs and crows. Eider ducks    
 breed there. The only sign of human   
 habitation is the ruin of a shooting- 
 box built of the local stone which is 
 basalt. There is no landing-place.    
 Boats have to stand off while a small 
 boat brings passengers to a           
 scrambling- place on the rocks. The   
 vegetation is mainly rank grass and   
 heather with bracken, thrift and      
 scurry-grass - all th commoner types  
 of cliff-top vegetation. There is     
 grazing for a few sheep.
