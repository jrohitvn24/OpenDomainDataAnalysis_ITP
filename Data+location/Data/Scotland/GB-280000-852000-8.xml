		<content>{ Easter Glackton}is a very interesting
 farm.It has the very first milking    
{carousel}in{Scotland.}This{carousel   
 goes round in a circle as the cows are
 being milked. First,one door opens and
 a cow steps in; each cow has a number 
 and in the middle of the{carousel}a   
 man stands and slips the number into a
 slot to remind him that that cow has  
 been milked.                          
{ Mr.Maclennan}has{120 cows}and they   
 give{1800 litres}daily.               
 When the milk is cooled it is put in  
 to tankers and sent away to the{Milk  
{Marketing Board.                      
 The farm was built in{1873}and a new  
 dairy was also built again in{1973.   
  The{cattle court}was burned down and 
 rebuilt in{1981.
