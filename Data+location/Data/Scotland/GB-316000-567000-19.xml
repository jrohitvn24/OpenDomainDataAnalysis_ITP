		<content>    Most of our block is farmland. In  
 this area there used to be lots of    
 dairy farms but there are not quite so
 many now because of the 'milk quota'  
 system which has been introduced.     
    We studied two farms in particular,
{Limekilns}and{Spittalriddinghill.}    
    Limekilns is a farm of about 375   
 acres (150 hectares) with 20 fields.  
 This year 3 are barley, 3 silage, 2   
 hay and i each for potatoes and kale. 
 The rest are grass for sheep and      
 cattle grazing. The animals kept are 2
 bulls, cows, calves, sheep and lambs  
 for breeding. All bull calves are     
 sold.                                 
   As the name of the farm suggests    
 there were in the past lime pits in   
 this area. Some of the buildings where
 the lime was treated are still in     
 existence.
