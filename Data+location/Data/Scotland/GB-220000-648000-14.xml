 The{main building}holds from P1 to P6.
 The P7 classes are in{huts}outside.   
 There are about{500 pupils}in the     
 school altogether and every year      
 pupils from{P7}leave for one of the   
 local{secondary schools,}mainly       
 Ardrossan Academy. We get play times  
 at 10.40a.m. and 2.30p.m. Lunchtime is
 from 12.20p.m. till 1.30p.m. We go    
 home at 3.35p.m.                      
 When the new school was built I think 
 it should have been made a lot larger.
 All three P7 classes use the huts     
 because it wasn't made large enough.  
 Most of the teachers prefer to work in
 the huts because it is much noisier in
 the new school but some teachers don't
 mind either way. I like the huts      
 better for the same reason.
