		<title>16Whitehills Fishing Life</title>
		<content>{I am 33 and have been fishing since I 
{left school}at 17 (with 8 'O' Levels) 
 to join my father's boat. I took my   
 master's ticket before I was 21.{I    
{never seriously thought about doing   
{anything else. I don't consider it    
{particularly dangerous.}With decked in
 shelters and modern communications    
 accidents are due usually more to     
 foolhardiness and carelessness than   
 anything else.                        
{I prefer to fish out of Whitehills}and
 within about 100 miles radius. Many   
 boats go from Whitehills to the West  
 Coast. This is a very lucrative       
 fishing area, but it involves time and
 expense getting there and back.{My    
{co-owner and  I are family men with   
{wives and families to consider.       
 I prefer to land at Whitehills, but   
 if I am fishing off Peterhead or      
 Fraserburgh I land for my best market.</content>
