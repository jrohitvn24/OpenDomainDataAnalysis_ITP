		<content> The{River Bervie}is a fine place for  
 boys to fish in. The fishing season   
 starts in April and ends in September.
 You have to have a licence which is   
 free but if you lose it you have to   
 pay Â£5.                               
 Popular kinds of fishing are worming, 
 fly fishing, spinning and the bad     
 people poach.                         
 The main fish caught are salmon, trout
 and rainbow trout.                    
 Another good sport is{BMX Cyling.}    
 We have a BMX track in our D Block    
 in Church Street. More than half the  
 kids have BMX bikes.                  
 The track is about 83 metres long.    
 There are two types of BMXing, Racing 
 and Freestyle tricks. The main tricks 
 are roll backs, ariels and kick turns.
