		<content>      {OIL RIGS                        
     With the discovery of oil in the  
 North Sea there was a need for deep   
 water sites for building concrete     
 platforms.Toward with it's Loch       
 Striven suited the purpose well.      
     The platforms were started in 1974
 and finished in 1975 because concrete 
 platforms went of fashion.            
     In this period of time they built 
 only two platforms which were towed to
 the North Sea on completion.          
     Sadly this was the end of Toward's
 connection with the oil "boom".
