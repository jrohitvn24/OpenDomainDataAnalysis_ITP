		<content> The block is comprised of the         
 mid-section of the Cowie valley with, 
 to the N. of the river, Glenton Hill  
 (174m) and to the S. the ridge formed 
 by the Hill of Swanley (229m) and     
 Cheyne Hill (170m). The Hill of       
 Swanley has mature coniferous forest  
 connecting to the W. with Fetteresso  
 Forest. Some felling has occurred     
 between minor road and river in Square
 2. Glenton Hill (sq.3) is heathland   
 with young conifer plantations on its 
 low southern slopes but with farmland 
 to both W (sqs. 1 &amp; 2) and E (sqs. 3 &amp;
 4). Cheyne Hill (sq. 8) is rough      
 grazing land (where an old wood used  
 to be) surrounded by coniferous       
 plantations to N and NW, although     
 invading birch is dominant on the     
 lower southern and western slopes. The
 southern slopes of Hill of Swanley are
 intensively farmed (sqs. 9,10,11 &amp; 12)</content>
