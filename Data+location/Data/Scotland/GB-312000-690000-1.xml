		<title>01General View of the Block</title>
		<content>  Our block lies in the county of Fife 
 with the villages of Hill of Beath and
 Kingseat and part of the town of      
 Cowdenbeath inside it.In the middle of
 the block is the M90 motorway running 
 from Edinburgh to Perth.Hill of Beath 
 is only about one mile or so from the 
 motorway.Most of the land is used for 
 farming,mainly grazing for sheep and  
 cows.Once coal was mined around the   
 Hill of Beath and Cowdenbeath         
 areas.Now all these pits have closed  
 down but some new industries have been
 set up.Some local people work in these
 factories but many travel farther to  
 go to work _Mossmorran petro-chemical 
 plant,Rosyth naval dockyard,shops and 
 offices in Dunfermline.The landscape  
 of the area is changing with the      
 opencast mining,the building of a new 
 dual carriageway and new housing.
