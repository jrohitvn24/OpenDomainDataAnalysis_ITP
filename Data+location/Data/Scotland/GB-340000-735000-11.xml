		<title>11THE FARMER'S WIFE</title>
		<content> Electricity was introduced to the     
 farms around 1948. Electricity has    
 made life easier for the farmer's wife
 in many ways. Before this cooking     
 was done over solid fuel ranges and{  
{PARAFFIN}lamps were used for lighting.
 Farmers' wives no longer find it      
 economic to make butter and cheese or 
 to keep chickens. In any case stray   
 dogs from Dundee's Whitfield housing  
 scheme often killed the chickens. In  
 fact recently sheep on lower fields   
 were being attacked by dogs and had to
 be moved to other pastures.           
 In the past the farmer's wife had to  
 clean out the{BOTHY}once a month.     
 Bothies were the living quarters of   
 batchelor farm workers who 'did for   
 themselves'. Bothying ended at        
 Shielhill in 1948. Younger wives are  
 now taking courses in book-keeping and
 accountancy to help their husbands.   </content>
