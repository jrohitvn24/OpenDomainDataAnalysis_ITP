		<title>14FARMING : Changes</title>
		<content>{Easter Balrymonth Farm                
 In the past twenty years there have   
 been great changes on this farm. It   
 has become far more mechanised with   
 the result that fewer people are      
 needed to man the farm. Twenty years  
 ago it employed five workers and now  
 can be managed by one.They do,        
 however, need extra helpers during    
 the busiest time of the year. With    
 increased mechanisation making farm   
 work quicker,the farm could become    
 larger and thus more profitable. Not  
 only do machines help, but the        
 introduction of pesticides and        
 fertilisers can double and even treble
 the crop yields. Crops are constantly 
 changing with better breeds being     
 introduced as well as new crops,such  
 as oil seed rape and peas which have  
 been grown on the farm in the last    
 five years.                           </content>
