		<title>09FISH PROCESSING AT L'MOUTH.</title>
		<content> The local Fish Processing Plant is    
 situated in the Harbour area of       
 Lossiemouth.This business has been in 
 operation,in its present form,for two 
 years and employs 30 people,mostly    
 women.The firm buy their raw material 
 at the local fish market.This consists
 of 50 stone of prawns bought daily.   
 The skilled workers shell the prawns  
 with amazing speed.The prawns are then
 washed thoroughly,before being loaded 
 into a frosting machine and left there
 for two hours.They are next passed    
 through a machine which coats them in 
 breadcrumbs.A conveyor belt delivers  
 the prawns to the packaging room.     
 Here they are put in trays and        
 labelled ready to be uplifted by      
 refrigerated lorries which transport  
 them to their markets.
