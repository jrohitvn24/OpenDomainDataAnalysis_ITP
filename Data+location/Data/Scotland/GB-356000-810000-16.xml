		<content> Some men work in the city or in oil   
 related work.  Only a small percentage
 of women work.                        
 The local families have been here for 
 generations but in recent years, with 
 the oil boom, there has been a steady 
 flow of incomers.  This situation will
 change with the fortunes of the oil   
 industry.                             
 Most families shop for food in Alford 
 and generally have regular shopping   
 trips to the large stores in Aberdeen 
 where they get a greater variety of   
 goods usually at cheaper prices.      
 Families in the isolated areas prepare
 themselves for winter by stocking up  
 with food.  It has been known for many
 shop shelves to be empty when storms  
 are threatened.  Holidays are not a   
 regular event.  Families associated   
 with farming cannot leave animals or  
 ignore haymaking and harvest time etc.</content>
