		<content> Farming around here is mixed farming, 
 i.e. sheep,cattle and cereal growing. 
 The trend is toward arable farming,   
 particularly on the larger farms which
 can cope with and afford the necessary
 heavy machinery.Winter wheat and      
 barley is being used increasingly.A   
 typical mixed farm of 200 acres might 
 have 90% sheep,5%cattle and 5% barley.
 The barley would be used to feed the  
 beasts and any surplus sold.All       
 livestock is raised for slaughter.    
     There are trends in               
 farming.Potatoes are on the increase  
 but still regarded as a minor crop.   
 Oilseed rape was being tried but one  
 farmer  thought it merely"a flash in  
 the pan."Livestock farming is much    
 more profitable than arable.The use of
 larger machines means a downward trend
 in the numbers of men employed.       
    Newtown has a herd of dairy cattle.</content>
