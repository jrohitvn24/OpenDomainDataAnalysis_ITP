		<title>07Creca Village Hall's Future</title>
		<content> The future of the hall is uncertain as
 the W.I. are the only organisation    
 using it. The Carpet Bowlers and Whist
 Players prefer to go elsewhere. The   
 Hall Committee have called several    
 public meetings which were poorly     
 attended. If the W.I. cannot meet the 
 expense of the Insurance and Rates,   
 the Hall will revert to the Trustees  
 and cease to be a Village Hall. The   
 difficulties of maintaining Village   
 Halls is a problem as it depends on   
 the needs of the village community and
 many halls are no longer a viable     
 proposition. Half the village would   
 regret the loss od the Hall but the   
 attractions outside the village       
 outweigh this.
