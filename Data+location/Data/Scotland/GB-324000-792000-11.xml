		<title>11The Balmoral Ponies</title>
		<content> Highland Fell and Haflinger ponies are
 kept at Balmoral stable. They are used
 for pony trekking. The pony trekking  
 starts in April and finishes in July. 
 They trek up and down the paths and   
 hills. It costs Â£7 for a half day and 
 Â£13 for a full day. The Duke of       
 Edinburgh drives a team of Fell ponies
 and competes in various shows.        
 My dad is head pony man for Balmoral  
 Estate. He has to get up very early to
 feed any ponies that are away out on  
 the hill and do not have much grass.  
 Those in the stables are fed once     
 in the morning, a little snack in the 
 afternoon and again at night.         
 The Haflinger ponies are used for deer
 stalking. The dead game is carried    
 across their backs. Sometimes the     
 forest vehicles cannot get in to pull 
 out felled trees so the ponies are    
 used for the job.                     </content>
