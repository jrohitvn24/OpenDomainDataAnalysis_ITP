		<content> Duddingston Loch and Arthur's Seat    
 have limited the outward growth of    
{Duddingston village}on most sides and 
 it has to a large extent retained its 
 original form. Since 1975 the village 
 and the surrounding land have been a  
 Conservation Area. Some{20}buildings  
 are{"listed"}and have survived in a   
 relatively unaltered state or have    
 been carefully restored. Also         
 important to local character are the  
 large gardens, mature trees and high  
 stone boundary walls.                 
 The{Portobello Conservation Area}was  
 designated in 1977 and covers much of 
 the old burgh. It derives its         
 character from the many elegant       
 terraces and villas built during the  
 18th and 19th centuries and from its  
 mature trees, small parks and sea     
 views. Some{250}buildings are{"listed"
 but many are of a minor category.     </content>
