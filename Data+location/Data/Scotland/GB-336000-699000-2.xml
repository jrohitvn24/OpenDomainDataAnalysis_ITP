		<title>02  Best Day Of My Holidays</title>
		<content>  On Tuesday morning I woke up,got     
 washed and dressed then went through  
 the kitchen for a cup of coffee.We    
 decided to go to St Andrews for a run.
 My brother sat in the back of the car 
 playing with his cars.We drove along  
 the coast road and passing through    
 Kingsbarns my dad said it had won an  
 award for being the cleanest village  
 in Scotland.When we arrived in St     
 Andrews we had a walk round the ruins 
 of the castle and the cathedral,and   
 had a look at the infamous "Bottle    
 Dungeon".After dinner(I had steak pie 
 and chips)we returned to Leven where  
 I played the amusements and had three 
 turns on the Waltzers.Too soon it was 
 time to go home and change for Donna's
 birthday party.It was a disco and I   
 had a great time.
