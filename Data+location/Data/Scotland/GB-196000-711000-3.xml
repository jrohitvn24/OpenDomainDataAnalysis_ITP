		<title>03THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> The church took two years to build and
 was finished in 1774.The stone that   
 built the church was of course local  
 stone.It was quarried and carted by   
 horse to the burial ground.A new roof 
 was built on to the vestry and the    
 windows were repaired.A new stained   
 glass window was erected in memory of 
 John McPherson,who was Ardchonnell's  
 School master.                        
   35 grave stones now stand in the    
 grave yard.The oldest grave stone was 
 put there in 1333.The present church  
 was the only church to be built on the
 site, and remains unchanged.The door  
 has never been moved from its present 
 position.                             
   Less people come to the church      
 nowadays than in the old days.Only 10 
 people come to the church service     
 nowadays.                             
                                       </content>
