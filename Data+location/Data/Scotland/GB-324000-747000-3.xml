		<content> Newspaper reports suggest that upwards
 of twenty per cent of the raspberry   
 crop was unable to be picked due to   
 the lack of labour at the appropriate 
 time.                                 
 This year there were two events that  
 brought Alyth to the notice of the    
 rest of the country :-                
     BBC Television decided to use     
 Alyth as the setting for a period TV  
 programme set in Scotland around 1950 
 and the choice was made as it was     
 considered that there had been no     
 drastic changes to the character of   
 the town since then .My own experience
 is that the town is unspoiled by      
 change since my earliest recollections
 when staying with my cousin the Rev   
 Jacob Sibbald Clark in the High Manse 
 and attending Alyth Public School in  
 the 1940s.I await with excitement the 
 screening of the programme as do many </content>
