		<title>12TYPES OF ANIMALS NEAR HOWNAM</title>
		<content> It can be expected,with people living 
 in a rural enviroment,as do those near
 the village of Hownam in the Scottish 
 Borders,that animals play a large part
 in their lives.Apart from farm stock a
 number of pets are kept too.  The 12  
 permanantly occupied houses have      
 between them 28 working collies, 7 pet
 dogs, 21 cats and four horses.Of caged
 pets there are six rabbits,one guinea-
 pig and one hampster and 2 people keep
 a budgie.Also kept in the area are 96 
 hens and one goose, six goats and a   
 milk cow. Wild animals too are seen in
 abundance, with foxes, hares and mice 
 top of the list. Next come rabbits,   
 weasles,moles,shrews,hedgehog and deer
 with rats ans stoats not far behind.  
 More than half the population have    
 seen badgers in the area,and a few    
 less had spotted mink, adders and     
 squirrels.                            </content>
