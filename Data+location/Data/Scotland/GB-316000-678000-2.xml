		<title>02BARNBOUGLE CASTLE</title>
		<content>  The original owners of{Barnbougle    
{Castle}were the{Moubrays,}Knights     
 Templar, who after giving up their    
 Crusades went to live there and took  
 up smuggling.In 1615 they sold the    
 castle to the{Earls of Haddington,    
 leaving behind a large quantity of    
 gunpowder which blew the roof off.    
  In 1662,{Sir Archibald Primrose of   
{Carrington}purchased the castle.His   
 son was created 1st Earl of Rosebery  
 in 1703 and the Roseberys lived there 
 until 1817.                           
  Barnbougle Castle is a plain lofty   
 13th century building with few        
 architectural details.It is one of the
 earliest instances of the abandonment 
 of the old enclosing wall for an open 
 defenceless enclosure.                
{ Adam's}scheme was for a triangular   
 castle pointing to the Forth but was  
 redesigned for the 5th Earl.          </content>
