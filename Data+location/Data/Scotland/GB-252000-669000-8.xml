		<content> THE LANDSCAPE OF DRUMCHAPEL IS QUITE  
 HILLY BUT INTO KNIGHTSWOOD IT IS QUITE
 FLAT.THERE ARE A LOT OF DRUMLINS      
 CREATED BY GLACIATION IN DRUMCHAPEL.  
 DRUMCHAPEL TAKES ITS NAME FROM THE    
 MANY DRUMLINS IN DRUMCHAPEL.          
 MOST OF THE LAND IN DRUMCHAPEL HAS    
 BEEN USED FOR A LARGE HOUSING SCHEME  
 BUT THERE IS STILL A BIT OF WOODLAND  
 LEFT HERE.                            
 THERE ARE A FEW FARMS AND SOME PARKS  
 IN THE AREA WE ARE SURVEYING SUCH AS  
 DAWSHOLM AND COLQUHOUN PARK...ETC     
 THE KNIGHTSWOOD AREA IS FLAT AND IT IS
 EASY TO BUILD ON.                     
                                       
 BEARSDEN IS QUITE HILLY,SHARING THE   
 SAME LOWLAND GLACIATED LANDSCAPE AS   
 DRUMCHAPEL.
