		<content> Renfrew consists of both private and  
 public housing. In common with most of
 Scotland the majority of houses are   
 rented from the local authority. Most 
 of it was built in the post war       
 period and consists of mainly terraced
 or new tenement type housing. The most
 recent development,however, is in the 
 private sector. Two estates, Deanpark 
 and Deanfield have been built on the  
 site of the old airport and former    
 golf course. They consist of detached 
 and semi-detached property and are    
 open plan. Their closeness to the     
 motorway and Airport make them popular
 with businessmen and commuters to     
 Glasgow and Paisley. Nearer the town  
 centre are a number of privately owned
 substantial sandstone properties.     
 There re three sheltered housing      
 complexes for the elderly.
