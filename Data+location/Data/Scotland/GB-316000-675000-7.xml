		<content> A day in the life of an 11 year-old   
 boy:  Saturday is a busy day for me.  
 At 0800 I have breakfast and sometimes
 go to play in the school football     
 team.I go to my guitar lesson at 1215 
 and have ti get my music ready and    
 check my guitar.I take the bus part of
 the way.After the lesson I walk to the
 bus-stop and take the bus home. Often 
 my friends are on the bus. After      
 something to eat I like to go golfing 
 at Silverknowes. In the evening I     
 usually watch a film with my dad. I   
 enjoy choosing a video with him. I    
 have a couple of biscuits before      
 saying goodnight. In bed I listen to  
 Ultravox which is pop music at its    
 best. I have just got a new Walkman   
 personal stereo. I haven't used it    
 outside yet. I go to sleep about 2300 
 knowing I need not get up early in the
 morning.                              </content>
