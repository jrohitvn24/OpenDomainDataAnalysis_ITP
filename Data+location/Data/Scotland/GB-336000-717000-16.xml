		<title>16FARMING..CHANGES</title>
		<content> In the 1940's most farm workers lived 
 in tied cottages or ploughman's       
 bothies. Now, however, most prefer to 
 live in Cupar and travel to work by   
 car. Some of the cottages have been   
 renevated and let or sold to          
 non-farming people, although many have
 fallen into despair.                  
  In the 1940's teams of men were      
 brought in at harvest time for about 3
 weeks work, which finished with the   
 Harvest Home Celebrations. Nowadays   
 farming is highly mechanised. Many big
 farms employed family teams to work as
 gardener/cook/maid etc. One lady we   
 interviewed worked as a maid at       
 Craigsanqhar, with only two hours     
 off a week, on a Saturday. She also   
 remembers in 1947 the Foodie/Denbrae  
 being blocked by snow and cleared by  
 German prisoners of war.
