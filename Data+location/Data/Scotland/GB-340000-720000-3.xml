		<title>03Housing in Balmullo</title>
		<content> Balmullo is situated on the A92 which 
 links Dundee with Cupar.   It has     
 become much bigger in the past few    
 years, as many new houses (mainly     
 bungalows) have been built.   Many    
 people came to live in Balmullo       
 because of its location.   It is      
 within easy travelling distance of    
 Dundee, Cupar, St. Andrews and        
 Glenrothes and many of the new        
 residents work in one of these        
 towns.   Many are also stationed at   
 R.A.F. Leuchars, which is just two    
 miles away.                           
                                       
 However, the houses in Main Street    
 are much older.   We have seen        
 photographs of the village which were 
 taken in the 19th Century and this    
 part of it has hardly changed at all. 
 We therefore have quite an interesting
 contrast in designs of houses.        </content>
