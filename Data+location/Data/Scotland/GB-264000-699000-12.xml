		<title>12THORNHILL FOOTBALL  CLUB</title>
		<content> Thornhill football team has eleven    
 players and two substitutes. The usual
 nights for a match are Wednesday and  
 Saturday. Every night at the end of a 
 match the other team picks the Man of 
 the Match in the opposing team. This  
 means the opposing team picks who they
 think played the best, and award him  
 "Man of the Match". This is to        
 encourage the players to do better.   
 The team coach is "Tich" Ainsley and  
 he takes care of the park and the     
 raffle tickets. The football park in  
 which they play on home games is at   
 the corner of the Loan and stretches  
 round to the swing park. The teams    
 Thornhill usually play are Kippen,    
 Gargunnock, Buchlyvie, Gartmore,      
 Gartocharn and Aberfoyle. The team's  
 colours are light blue or a red top   
 with navy shorts.
