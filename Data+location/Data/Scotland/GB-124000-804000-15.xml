 However, many of these items are      
 bought when the islanders go to the   
 mainland. Most households get extra   
 stores by buying in bulk from a       
 wholefood wholesaler in Edinburgh.    
 These orders are sent by post, and    
 often two or three households will    
 combine and share the carriage costs. 
 These goods are sent approximately    
 every two months.                     
                                       
 Diesel and calor gas are sent from    
 Mallaig when required. Coal and other 
 heavy or bulky items are sent annually
 on a cargo boat, chartered by the     
 National Trust for Scotland, referred 
 to as the Puffer. The coal is         
 distributed amongst the households as 
 and when required.
