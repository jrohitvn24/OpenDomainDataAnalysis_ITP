		<content> There are two main kinds of           
 farm_arable and stock. However, many  
 of these are mixed farms. A third type
 of farm is a small_holding. This is a 
 small farm of not more than 13 to 14  
 acres, and the small_holder works with
 the Forestry Commission.              
 The crops grown on normal{arable farms
 are wheat and barley (Spring and      
 Winter), potatoes and turnips (tatties
 and neeps).                           
 Oilseed Rape is a fairly new crop,but 
 most farmers grow it because it is a  
 high yield crop and because of the    
 E.E.C subsidy. The seed is round and  
 black and is planted in August. It    
 grows quite quickly and a year later  
 it is ready to be harvested. Small    
 pods grow containg small seeds        
 which,if crushed,produce oil. The oil 
 is used for cooking oil,margarine,    
 salad cream and soap.                 </content>
