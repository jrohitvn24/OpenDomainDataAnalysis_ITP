		<content>     Glamis Primary School has four    
 classrooms, two in the original school
 building built in the mid 1800's, and 
 two in "temporary" classrooms.  There 
 is a tarmaced playground, with        
 shelters and a "soup kitchen gifted by
 Lord and Lady Strathmore on January   
 27th 1899 for the benefit of the      
 children".  This quotation comes from 
 the School Log which is continuous    
 from 1874 to 1978.                    
    The school has modern indoor       
 toilets - a recent innovation, dating 
 from early 1982.  There are sports    
 grounds in a nearby field in Glamis   
 Castle grounds.                       
     Most children from Glamis goto    
 Seconary School in Kirriemuir 8 km    
 away.  Children with learning         
 difficulties goto school in Dundee 20 
 km away.
