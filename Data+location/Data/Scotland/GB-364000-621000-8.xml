		<content> This is a very large factory on the   
 Bankend Estate beside the R.Jed.      
 When we arrived there was a strong    
 smell in the air and we found out why 
 when we were taken around.The skins of
 sheep and goats were being washed and 
 put into piles-they were being        
 graded.They use a lot of chemicals    
 which would pollute the drains so they
 have their own anti-pollution settling
 tanks,including a big new one.        
 Inside the factory,water was being    
 sprayed from pipes to keep the air    
 moist.Over 1,000,000 skins a year are 
 dealt with,and pickled pelts value    
 Â£3,000,000 are exported each year.    
 Big lorries leave Jedburgh regularly  
 with skins valued at over Â£100,000    
 going mainly to Italy,also France and 
 Turkey.Skins also go to N.America.    
   Over 40 people are employed.
