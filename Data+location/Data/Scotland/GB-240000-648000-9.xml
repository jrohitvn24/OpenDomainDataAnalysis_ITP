 THESE ARE SITUATED IN THE CONSERVATION
 AREA OF THE VILLAGE.MOST OF THESE

 OLD.                                  
  THERE ARE SEVEN PRIVATE HOUSES IN DAM

 DETATCHED VILLA AT WOODSIDE.THE       
 PREVIOUS OWNERS OF DAM PARK LIVE IN AN
 OLDER HOUSE AT THE TOP OF WOODSIDE.

 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THE VILLAGE    
 BECAUSE OF THE SEWAGE PROBLEM.
