 In 1924 a{foot-bridge}was built by the
 Motherwell Bridge Company.  By the    
{burn}at the foot-bridge there was a   
{mill. }It was called the              
{clattering-mill.                      
   It had a tall house and garden.     
 There is a sign at the side of the    
 burn which says that if anyone is     
 caught putting litter in the burn they
 will be fined Â£25.                    
   At the railway-bridge to the quarry 
 the burn is sinking sand.  There are  
 minnows in the burn.  Before the      
 burn was cleaned out a local farmer's 
 field was flooded.  Now the burn is   
 not flooded.                          
   The farmer now grows silage in the  
 field .  The burn starts at           
{Forrestburn Reservoir}and finishes    
 at the{River Avon.
