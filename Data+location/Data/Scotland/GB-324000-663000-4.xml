 Politics-There is an annexe to Roslin 
 School at Bilston for P1 and 2.  The  
 council wanted to close it down to    
 save money but a parent's campaign    
 saved it.                             
 Events - each summer 9 local primary  
 schools compete in the inter-school   
 sports.  Each school chooses a team to
 represent them in various track       
 events.  This year the event was      
 renamed the Penicuik and District     
 Athletics Festival.  The venue was the
 new Beeslack High School.  New events 
 were introduced such as the triathlon,
 long jump, a tug of war and a long    
 race!
