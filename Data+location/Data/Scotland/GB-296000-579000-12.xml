		<title>12CRIME IN LOCHARBRIGGS</title>
		<content>                                       
 Locharbriggs is a relatively quiet    
 area as far as crime is concerned.    
 There is only ten policemen throughout
 the area.  The most common are        
 vandalism and small thefts.  Most of  
 the crimes are committed by male      
 youths.  Unemployment has affected the
 crime rate very slightly.  It is the  
 local people who commit the crimes.   
 Occasionally the businesses at the    
 aerodrome get broken into, but by     
 large, the area is free from major    
 crimes.
