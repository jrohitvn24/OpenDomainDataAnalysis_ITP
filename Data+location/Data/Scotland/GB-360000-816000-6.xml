		<content> Employment opportunities for young    
 people are  few. Most, especially the 
 career minded, find employment in     
 Aberdeen. This involves either        
 commuting daily which is expensive and
 time consuming, or moving into a flat 
 or lodgings. The latter alternative   
 is also expensive in the U.K.'s oil   
 capital  but is more convenient both  
 for work and recreational activities. 
 Any vacancies which arise locally for 
 females are usually taken up by       
 married women  although a few boys are
 fortunate to be offered               
 apprenticeships with local tradesmen  
 or find  work in agriculture.         
 A rural background appears to be a    
 "plus" in the eyes of prospective     
 employers and most young people in our
 area are in employment although not   
 necessarily in the job they would have
 liked.                                </content>
