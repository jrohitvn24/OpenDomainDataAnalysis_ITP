		<title>01KIRKWALL IN THE ORKNEYS</title>
		<content> The main land cover in the 12km is    
 intensively managed farmland because  
 Orkney's main income is agriculture,  
 especially beef and dairy farming.    
 Another of Orkney's main sources of   
 income is the oil terminal on the     
 south island of Flotta. It has helped 
 a great deal to increase Kirkwall's   
 population. Most of these people are  
 either locals or from other parts of  
 Great Britain.There are very few      
 foreigners in Orkney.A new industry   
 just started is fish farming.         
 Mostly salmon and oysters are farmed  
 but also a few lobsters.There are only
 a few fish farms as yet, but soon it  
 might become a profitable industry.The
 local industries include silvercraft, 
 the designs on which are all connected
 with Orkney.Traditionally, wood was   
 scarce and chairs were made of straw. 
 These are still being made today.     </content>
