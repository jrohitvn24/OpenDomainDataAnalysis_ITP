		<content>   There are no State Nursery Schools  
 in the area so under-fives attend the 
 nearby nursery at Giffnock Primary    
 School which caters for almost sixty  
 infants aged 4-5. One class have      
 morning, the other afternoon sessions 
 five days a week. The children learn  
 through play with jigsaws, sand,      
 counting-beads and toys. They are     
 taught simple songs, poems, basic     
 reading skills and crafts such as clay
 modelling.                            
   There are several local playgroups  
 run several mornings a week by mothers
 of children who do not go to nursery. 
 Most receive council subsidies to pay 
 for the hire of a church or town hall,
 but ask a small fee per child for the 
 cost of toys, paints etc. These groups
 are mainly for enjoyment and offer    
 little emphasis on learning as the    
 staff are untrained.                  </content>
