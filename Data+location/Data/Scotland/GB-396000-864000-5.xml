		<content>   Fraserburgh was named in{1592}by    
{Royal Decree of James VI}after        
{Alexander Fraser of Philorth}made     
 improvements to the town. The village 
 of{Faithlie,}as the town was known    
 before, had existed on the site from  
 well{before 1370.                     
   For a short time after 1592 a       
{university}was run in the town, and   
 now it is remembered in the street    
 name{"College Bounds".                
   The{fishing industry}is the town's  
 main claim to fame and{sea-faring}has 
 been associated with{Kinnaird Head}for
 a very long time.                     
{  Kinnaird Head Lighthouse}is built on
 the remains of the{Frasers' castle}and
 other notable buildings are{"Warld's  
{End",}the{Wine Tower,}and{Dalrymple   
{Hall.
