{event}. It was a great day with plenty
 of excitement.                        
    It all started with the potato and 
 spoon race. Then it was the{flat      
{races,}which the local villagers,     
 mums, dads and little brothers and    
 sisters all enjoyed.                  
    There were also wild horses,       
 three-legged and sack races. Primary  
 five, six and seven were split into   
 two teams. The teams were called{Cree 
{and Bladnoch.}If you were in these    
 classes and you won a race, your      
 points were put in a book and added up
 at the end. The most exciting events  
 were the{relay races.}The best of     
 these races was the boys "A" team

 Eventually, however, Bladnoch won     
 overall by ten points - 167v157.      </content>
