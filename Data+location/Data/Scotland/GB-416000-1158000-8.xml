		<content> Shetland is a windy place because we  
 are low lying.The average windspeed   
 for each day last year was 14 knots.  
 Even in summer a still day is rare.   
  Being so far North, in the summer    
 the days are very long, with hardly   
 any night.Last year June was the      
 sunniest month with 5.2 hours of sun  
 shine a day,on average.Although the   
 warmest was August with an average    
 temperature of12.7 degrees Celsius    
  The rainfall last year was 1090mm.   
 with October (173mm) as the wettest.  
 Our rainfall is generally comparable  
 to South Western Scotland.            
   January was the coldest month (1.7c)
 and as we are exposed to the north we 
 do get quite a lot of snow.Fortunately
 ,it doesnt lie for very long ,because 
 we are an island.                     
   We can be subjected to particularly 
 severe gales around the Equinox.      </content>
