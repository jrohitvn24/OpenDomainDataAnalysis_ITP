 Bo'ness and farm land to the south of 
 the town. Bo'ness is short for

 into the River Forth. There are       
 several housing estates in this area. 
 The Robertson Estate is a private     
 housing estate . These houses were    
 built in 1980. The Mingle and         
 Grahamsdyke are council estates which 
 were built in the 1960's and '70s.    
 There is a Recreation centre which    
 has dry and wet sports facilities.    
 Muirhouses, or the Murrays, as local  
 people call it is a small village     
 which is now part of Bo'ness. It has a
 small council housing estate, some old
 private houses, some modern bungalows 
 and one general shop.
