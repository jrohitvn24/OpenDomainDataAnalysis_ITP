		<title>13HISTORY AROUND CARSPHAIRN</title>
		<content>{CARNAVEL}Near the farm are the remains
 of a neolithic long cairn and some    
 round Bronze Age cairns.The ancient   
 route to the Solway through Galloway  
 can still be followed over the hill   
 above the farm.                       
{CHURCH}The present church was built in
 1815 and an unusual central communion 
 table can be seen inside.             
{VILLAGE}The history of the village can
 be traced back to at least 1635, when 
 Charles I granted a charter to Robert 
 Grierson of Lag, making the Kirktoun  
 of Carsphairn into a Burgh.In 1671 the
 charter was renewed by Charles II. By 
 it, Carsphairn was entitled to elect  
 bailies, build a tolbooth, erect a    
 cross, create burgesses, have a weekly
 market, and have two annual fairs.    
 (History of Lands &amp; their Owners Vol. 
 III).It is possible that the Show held
 now, is a relic of the charter.       </content>
