		<title>01THE VILLAGE OF DOUNE</title>
		<content> The Village of Doune lies in a        
 lovely setting of hills and rivers in 
 Central Scotland. The area is mainly  
 rural with 2 main estates, Argaty and 
 Moray. Doune is dominated by the{     
{castle}built in 1370 by Robert Duke of
 Albany and restored in 1883-86.       
 Beautifully maintained with several   
 rooms still in use today it was handed
 over to the Ancient Monument          
 Department in 1984. Fishermen find the
 nearby fast flowing{River Teith}      
 excellent for salmon and brown trout. 
 Doune has many interesting features; a
 village cross dating from early       
 trading days, some{standing stones}   
 where the drovers' trails met and     
 several old churches and houses.      
 Today there is a new housing estate on
 the outskirts of the village, but Main
 Street still retains its{old world    
{village character.                    </content>
