 There is no village or town called    
 Ballindalloch ,but the hamlet of      
 Marypark has 26 houses.One of them    
 contains what is probably the smallest
 Post Office in Britain as its premises
 occupy the alcove in the hall under   
 the stairs.                           
     Near the junction of the Avon and 
 the Spey stands the fine and historic 
 Ballindalloch Castle,which has been   
 continuously occupied by the same     
 family line since 1546.               
     Most of the older buildings are   
 constructed of traditional stone and  
 lime, with slate roofs.In some cases, 
 granite from nearby Ben Rinnes was    
 used.                                 
     A feature of the area is the      
 number of bridges of varying styles.  
 One is said to be of unique           
 construction.                         </content>
