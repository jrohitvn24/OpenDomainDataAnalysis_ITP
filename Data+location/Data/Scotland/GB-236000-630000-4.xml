		<title>04SHOPPING IN SYMINGTON 1985</title>
		<content>  The old shops in Symington used to be
 in{Main Street.}This was a very       
 dangerous place to have a shop because
 there is a very bad bend there.       
   The present shops are placed on     
{Brewlands Drive.}There is a row of six
 shops.Kirklands newsagent which sells 
 comics,sweets,papers,stationery and   
 toy cars.Myra's is a hairdressers     
 which styles your hair.Docherty's post
 office as well as selling stamps also 
 sells food.It has a meat counter and  
 many shelves of groceries.T.A Conner  
 is the butcher.He sells many different
 kinds of meat.The Halifax Building    
 Society is very useful to account     
 holders in that building society,     
 because it means they won't have to go
 to town to pay in or take out money.  
 The other shop has closed down now.   
 It used to be a fruit shop.Having     
 shops in Symington is very convenient.</content>
