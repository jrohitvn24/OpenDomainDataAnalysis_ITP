		<content>{Arbuthnott Womens Rural Institute}was 
 founded in 1966. In 1985,membership at
 about 30 is strong for such a tiny    
 community. Age range is wide,from     
 teenagers to senior citizens. Monthly 
 meetings,September to June,give       
 members a chance to try varied skills.
 At each meeting a guest gives a talk  
 or demonstration on anything from     
 domestic skills such as cooking to    
 leisure pursuits like floral art.     
 Monthly members competitions relate to
 skills and techniques shown earlier.  
 The annual flower show is held in     
 March. Christmas and Halloween parties
 for local children are also organised 
 by the WRI. Small donations to local  
 charities are made annually. Each year
 ends with the trophy and prize        
 presentations to members scoring most 
 competition points and the appointment
 of the following year's committee.    </content>
