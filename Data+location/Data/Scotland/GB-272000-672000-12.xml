		<title>12SCHOOL IN CUMBERNAULD _ 2</title>
		<content> My school{(St. Maurice's High)}was    
 opened in{1976.}There are{950 pupils} 
 at present. The school is well        
 planned, with modern facilities such  
 as a swimming pool,gymnasium,dance    
 studio,games hall,theatre,football and
 hockey pitches.                       
 School begins at 9.00 am with assembly
 then straight to our first class      
 (which is R.E. on a Monday). This     
 period lasts 65 minutes then a bell   
 rings for us to move to period 2      
 (History) for one hour. We then have a
 15 minute interval followed by 15     
 minutes registration. Period 3 (P.E., 
 or Latin for some) lasts 1 hour taking
 us to our lunch hour. Most people have
 a packed lunch then we spend the rest 
 of the time in the yard. The afternoon
 begins with English for 65 minutes and
 finishes with an hour of Science.
