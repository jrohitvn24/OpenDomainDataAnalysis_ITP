		<title>17CHANGES IN ALVA</title>
		<content> People who have lived in Alva all     
 their lives have noticed lots of      
 changes. The main one is that Alva has
 grown bigger. The{population}has      
 doubled in the last 10 years. People  
 hope that Alva does not get any bigger
 because then the{community}spirit     
 would be lost. As Alva has grown there
 are now better facilities for every-  
 one. There are new primary and        
 secondary{schools,}a sports complex   
 and a community centre converted from 
 the old school. Elderly people have   
 special{sheltered housing,}some of it 
 provided by the{Cochrane Foundation.  
 This is an organisation started by a  
 local family which made money from    
 weaving factories in America in the   
 1860's.
