		<title>12Lochside Gala.</title>
		<content>   This year I was chosen as{Lochside  
{Gala Queen.} I was very excited and   
 nervous as I had to wear a long dress,
 a cloak and a crown.   At last the big
 day came but unfortunately it was     
 raining.  In spite of the bad weather 
 many people lined the streets, waving 
 and cheering as I rode past in a horse
 drawn carriage.  The procession was   
 led by{Killoch Colliery Pipe Band,    
 then came my carriage followed by the 
 brightly coloured floats of the{Boys' 
{Brigade, Majorettes and Youth Club.   
   When we reached the church I declar_
 ed the fete which had all sorts of    
 stalls open.The army and fire brigade 
 put on displays and there were        
 games for children.  All the money    
 raised is used to make our area a     
 better place.  Although it was a wet  
 day everyone enjoyed themselves and   
 went home wet but happy.              </content>
