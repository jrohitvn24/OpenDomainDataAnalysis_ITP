		<title>10SPORTS - OLD KILPATRICK</title>
		<content> When asked about the provision of     
 sports facilities in the village, the 
 general opinion of the locals was that
 there were virtually none at the      
 moment and that the building of a     
 sports complex was long overdue.      
                                       
{Individual requests included:         
 Tennis courts                         
 More football pitches                 
 Swimming pool                         
 Swing parks; playgrounds for younger  
 children.                             
                                       
 The older age group requested a       
 community  hall where they could meet 
 for snooker; cards; darts; bingo and  
 concerts or just to have a chat over a
 cup of tea or coffee. A place where   
 the elderly, the unemployed and the   
 young mothers could all meet.
