		<content> Many of their reports involve outside 
 broadcasts and they were one of the   
 first networks to use an Electronic   
 Newsgathering System,E.N.G.           
 Northsound began in 1981.Most of its  
 programmes consist of playing pop and 
 light music.Their other function is to
 broadcast local news and information  
 about local events which would not    
 otherwise be broadcast on the national
 media.                                
 This year Cable T.V. was introduced in
 Aberdeen, the first cable station to  
 open in Scotland.At present only a    
 few areas of the city receive it but  
 distribution is expected to increase  
 over the next few years.As yet it is  
 difficult to comment on its impact or 
 future success. The public have direct
 access to Cable T.V. via a 'Speak     
 Easy' booth located in the Rutherford 
 Celebration Centre in Rosemount.      </content>
