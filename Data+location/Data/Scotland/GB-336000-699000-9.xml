		<title>09    Shopping Survey</title>
		<content> Leven High Street is very popular     
 with shoppers.One Friday six of us did
 a shopping survey.We found that only  
 25% lived in Leven. Of the 57% who    
 came by bus 61% found the bus service 
 good enough.43% came by car. Of these,
 64% said there were enough parking    
 spaces.                               
    We also found that 44% came more   
 than once a week mostly to food shops.
 57% didn't think there was a good     
 enough variety of shops.Some people   
 wanted things changed.More chain      
 stores like C&amp;A or Marks and Spencers.
 More childrens clothes shops and      
 supermarkets.Most of the younger folk 
 wanted a leisure centre and a swimming
 pool. Whereas the older people wanted 
 Leven to look like it was before the  
 roads were dug up and the shops were  
 renovated. Of all we interviewed only 
 one person liked it as it was.        </content>
