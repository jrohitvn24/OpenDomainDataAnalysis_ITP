 place for tremendous numbers of wild  
 geese, especially Pinkfoot.  In summer
 vast numbers of birds choose the area 
 as a breeding ground, Terns           
 particularly.  All five species of    
 Britain's terns have been known to    
 breed in the bay.  Their favourite    
 nesting ground is the sand bar at the 
 eastern end of the bay. Many other    
 wildfowl frequent the environs of the 
 bay.

 varieties of wild flowers and their   
 associated visitors.  The Reserve

 colonisation for various species of   
 plants and animals.  Flowers which can
 be found in prolific numbers include  </content>
