		<content> The Osteopathic profession deals not  
 only with the treatment of muscular   
 derangements but with a wide range of 
 health problems, by means of detection
 and correction of faulty structure and
 function in the body. It accepts that 
 self-healing is possible, provided    
 there are favourable internal and     
 external conditions, good nutrition   
 and normal structural integrity.      
 Chiropractice is based on the idea    
 that misplaced spinal joints could    
 impinge on the nerves, causing disease
 elsewhere in the body. Treatment is by
 high velocity thrust techniques, and  
 increasing interest is in joint       
 dysfunction causing back and neck     
 pains, rather than the treatment of   
 ill health. Manipulative therapy      
 techniques are used to improve        
 physical joint and muscle dysfunction,
 mechanical functions, by massage.     </content>
