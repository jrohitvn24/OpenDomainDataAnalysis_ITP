		<title>10MORE JOBS FOR A HILL FARMER</title>
		<content> On my morning inspection of my upland 
 farm near Hownam,in Scotland,I had    
 found that the cows had broken a fence
 so I loaded a trailer with stobs and  
 fencing tools,and was on my way to do 
 the repairs,when a travelling sales-  
 man arrived.I did not need the worm   
 drench he offered, so his visit was   
 short,and I got on with the fencing.I 
 had an hour off at lunch time,and then
 went out to bale hay. This was soon   
 interupted when a calving cow needed  
 some assistance. After my tea I built 
 the bales  into stacks of 8, and put a
 plastic bag on top, to keep any rain  
 from soaking down through. The goats  
 were now waiting to be milked,the     
 lambs to be fed, and the dogs fed and 
 shut up for the night.Now I could sink
 into a chair,and if no emergency arose
 doze until supper time, and then off  
 to bed till 6.45a,m. next morning.    </content>
