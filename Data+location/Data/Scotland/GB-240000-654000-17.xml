		<content>   The district lies on a small faulted
 area of carboniferous rock strata     
 surrounded by calciferous sandstone.  
 Because of these faults there is      
 varied and interesting flora.         
   Loch Libo,thought for many years to 
 be the home of a very rare fern,{the }
{crested buckler}(no longer seen),has  
 instead the{tufted sage}as well as    
 rare members of that and the Rush     
 family.The shy but beautiful{butterfly
{orchid}and the{lesser twayblade}can be
 seen.                                 
   The woodland is mainly deciduous    
 with the earliest trees being planted 
 by Baron Mure of Caldwell in the      
 treeless 18th century landscape. The  
 beech-lined road to Neilston is his   
 work too,though only one of his       
 beeches remains in the main street of 
 Uplawmoor.                            
                                       </content>
