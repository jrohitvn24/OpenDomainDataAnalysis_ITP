		<content> SHOPPING IN THE LUNAN AREA            
 There are no shops in this area and   
 the last general mobile shop to serve 
 this area ceased to operate earlier   
 this year. There is however a daily   
 delivery of milk and the milk man will
 also supply other dairy products and  
 daily newspapers on request. Twice    
 weekly a fish van from Gourdon        
 delivers fresh fish. The nearest shop 
 is in Inverkeilor village,            
 approximately 2 miles away, where     
 there is a combined general store and 
 post office. For other shops and      
 supermarkets the indigenous population
 have to travel to Arbroath or         
 Montrose.                             
 LIBRARY SERVICE. The mobile library   
 service visits this area every two    
 weeks and is well used.
