		<content> THE D-BLOCK HAS NO RAILWAYS,SO LIKE   
 MOST RURAL AREAS,BUS TRANSPORT IS     
 VITAL.LIKE MOST RURAL AREAS,BUSES ARE 
 FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.AUCHMUIR BRIDGE IS
 THE NODE OF THE BLOCK,THEREFORE WE    
 SURVEYED BUS SERVICES THROUGH THE     
 HAMLET.SINCE GLENROTHES IS THE LARGEST
 MAJOR SETTLEMENT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO
 THE BLOCK WE EXPECTED MOST SERVICES TO
 TRAVEL EAST TO GLENROTHES.DURING THE  
 NORMAL WEEKDAY,ONLY 2 SERVICES,LEAVING
 TILLICOULTRY AT 10.30 AND 15.30       
 TRAVELLED TO THE NEW TOWN,BUT 4 MADE  
 THE RETURN JOURNEY AT 08.00,12.00,    
 14.20 AND 16.30 GOING TO GLENROTHES   
 AND TILLICOULTRY.THIS WE FOUND CURIOUS
 .ON SATURDAY IT WAS 4 TO GLENROTHES,  
  09.00 AND 15.30 FROM TILLICOULTRY,   
 08.50 AND 13.50 FROM KINROSS BUT NONE 
 THE OTHER WAY.NEEDLESS TO SAY,ON      
 SUNDAY THERE WERE NO SERVICES AT ALL.
