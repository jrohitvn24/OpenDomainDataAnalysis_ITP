		<title>18RESTENNETH MOSS</title>
		<content> The area around Restenneth Priory is  
 called Restenneth Moss.  The{ecology  
 consists of tall reeds and marsh.  In 
 some areas there are bushes, short    
 grass and boggy ground.  The most     
 common bush around this area is the   
 Sallow.  All of the area around the   
 Priory is an area of{conservation}    
 designated as a Site of Special       
 Scientific Interest.  The moss has    
 never been disturbed before although a
 local company wanted to drain water   
 from the bogs but they were refused   
 permission.  In one area there are    
 very{rare plants}which the owners are 
 trying to preserve. Restenneth Priory 
 was surrounded by a loch or Moss which
 acted like a{moat.}The loch was       
 drained at the end of the 8th century 
 by George Dempster, a well known local
 agriculturalist, for the marl which   
 was used as fertiliser.               </content>
