 Gaelic although incomers and their    
 imitators tend to inhibit its use     
 among the very young.

 meetings are conducted in Gaelic when 
 possible.Conversations between        
 neighbours are in Gaelic.The local    
 radio station has regular Gaelic      
 broadcasts and they are widely        
 listened to.                          
{GAELIC IN NEWSPAPERS

 "Stornoway Gazette" and "West Highland
