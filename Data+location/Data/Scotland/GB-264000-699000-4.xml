		<title>04THORNHILL NORRIESTON FARM</title>
		<content> This farm is a large dairy farm.      
 110 British Friesian cows are milked  
 twice daily through a 16/16 Fullwood  
 Milking Parlour.Milk is sold off the  
 farm at 16p per litre.(In the shops   
 this costs us 43p).Much of the 165    
 acres of this farm is in grass for    
 grazing this herd of cows and the     
 young bulls and heifers and for       
 silage.Crops grown are spring         
 barley,winter wheat,winter barley and 
 hay.Three tractors are kept,one       
 combine harvester and various other   
 types of machinery for cultivation.   
 There is also 1 forklift and a baler. 
 None of the farms around here have    
 working horses but a few keep a       
 Clydesdale or two,mainly for pleasure.
