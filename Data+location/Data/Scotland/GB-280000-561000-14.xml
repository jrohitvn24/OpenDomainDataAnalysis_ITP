		<title>14COMPUTERS IN DALBEATTIE</title>
		<content> In recent years computers have become 
 very popular in Dalbeattie.It probably
 started off when adults bought their  
 children computers for presents.Most  
 children learn a great deal playing   
 games on them.They get great enjoyment
 out of playing such games.            
  Every school in the region has at    
 least one computer in it provided     
 partly from school funds and partly by
 the local authority.There are many    
 programmes available in most subjects,
 including maths,geography and problem 
 solving.Children are becoming quite   
 expert in using them.                 
  Even in local businesses there are   
 computers involved.All the banks and  
 the finance company have a computer   
 as well as the library, the factories 
 and the sawmill.
