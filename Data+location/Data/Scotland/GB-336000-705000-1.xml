		<content> In this area there is a lot of        
 coniferous woodland eg  Kulmix        
 Wood.Most of the woodland has been    
 planted by man.The woodland ,if joined
 together,would take up approximately  
 2-3 kilometers.There are several small
 streams,and at the edge of Carlurlie  
 Water Reservoir lies in the area (see 
 photo's).There isn't much settlement  
 in the area but there are a few farm  
 buildings at Greenside,Annfield and   
 Kilmix.The main use of the land is    
 mixed farming,along with forestry.The 
 maximum height in the area is 198m.   
 Main roads and minor roads can be seen
 in this area,the A road is the        
 A916(Kennoway to Cupar) which passes  
 the only school between Bonnybank and 
 Craigrothie.
