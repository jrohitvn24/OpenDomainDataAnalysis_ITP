		<title>12HOME LIFE</title>
		<content> The typical house a family would live 
 in is a semi-detatched.There would be 
 a ground and first floor.On the ground
 floor we have a living-room and       
 kitchen.The objects in our living-room
 are television,video and a suite.In   
 our kitchen the automatic washing     
 machine,tumble dryer,fridge-freezer   
 and gas cooker really help mum.On the 
 first floor.We have bedrooms and a    
 bathroom.In the bedroom we have beds  
 and wardrobes.On Saturday I help my   
 mum do the housework by using the     
 hoover to clean carpets and polish to 
 clean tables etc.I sometimes help mum 
 by washing the dishes or doing the    
 shopping in one of the local          
 supermarkets.Outside,we have a garden 
 where we grow vegetables and          
 flowers.We have a car for going runs  
 and using it for work.
