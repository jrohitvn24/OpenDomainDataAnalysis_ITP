		<content>   On Sunday we had breakfast and then 
 we went to Motherwell to look at      
 caravanettes. We want to buy one to go
 on holiday . We spent about an hour   
 there. A Toyota Hiace was my parents' 
 choice. I had a great time jumping in 
 and out of them.                      
   We went to Edinburgh next to visit  
 friends but they weren't in. So, we   
 went shopping instead.Mum bought a    
 coat for herself and some groceries   
 too. Toyshops were the next stop, and 
 then a restaurant. Here, we paid Â£4.75
 for a meal of hamburgers, chips, salad
 coffees (my parents had these) and    
  orange juice (my sister and I had    
 this).After going to the toilet, where
 a man locked the cubicle door from the
 outside,we returned to the friends'   
 house, who were in this time,and we   
 stayed for a meal.Afterwards we went  
 for a walk in a park.                 </content>
