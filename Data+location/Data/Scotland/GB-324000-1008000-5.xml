		<title>05FISHING</title>
		<content> Mr.Buchan of the River Dee, said they 
 normally catch about 700 cwt of fish a
 week. Their highest catch has been    
 1150 cwt.The heaviest fish they've    
 caught is a 16\ stone halibut, but    
 they mostly catch haddock.They have   
 fished only 3 mile off shore but have 
 also gone 400 mile for a catch.They   
 usually send their catch to Aberdeen. 
 When they are out at sea, they use    
 auto pilot for steering.Sometimes     
 the boat,with its 9 crew men (5 being 
 ashore) can be at sea for 10 days but 
 normally the boat goes for a week.Each
 crew man does about 33 trips a year.  
 The boat has its own ice plant.He     
 wears gloves when gutting the fish so 
 that he won't cut himself.However he  
 has been off work due to injury.He's  
 even crashed the boat once.
