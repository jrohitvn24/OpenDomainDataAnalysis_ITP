 residence, a boarding school for boys,

 GARTINCABER TOWER.A prominent landmark
 said to have been built as a summer   
 house by the owners of the estate and 
 used for sheltering when the weather  
 deteriorated during picnics is now    
 derelict but remains of fireplaces can
 be seen at two levels. Popularly known
 as the 'Centre of Scotland'.          
 LOCH-HILL TOLL This very old house,   
 once a staging-post on the old Glasgow
 road, is now occupied by the family of
 a former PERTH AND KINROSS COUNTY road
 foreman. On 15th May 1975 this whole  
 block, due to local government re-    
 organisation became part of CENTRAL   
 REGION.                               </content>
