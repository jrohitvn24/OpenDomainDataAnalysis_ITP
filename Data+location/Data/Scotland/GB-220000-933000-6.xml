		<content>  All of this area is rich in wild     
 life. Common Seals and Grey Seals can 
 be seen in the lochs, while otters,   
 badgers and foxes are fairly common   
 sights too. Red deer are down in the  
 area especially during cold weather.  
  Being in such a remote area, wild    
 flowers, ranging from the common to   
 the very rare, can grow un_hindered.  
  Bog bean, Lesser Spearwort, Water    
 Lobelia and Monkey_Flowers can be     
 found in and around the lochs. Among  
 the rocks, along the shore, Sea Pink, 
 Sea Campion, Scurvygrass and Good King
 Henry can be seen. Many varieties of  
 heathers cover the hillsides. There   
 wild orchids, Tufted Vetch and        
 Milkwort are also growing. Golden     
 Saxifrage, Round leaved Sundew, which 
 feed on the midges, and the Lesser    
 Butterfly Orchid are found in bogs.   
 These are some of our wild flowers.   </content>
