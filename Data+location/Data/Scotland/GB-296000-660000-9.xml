		<title>09ADDIEWELL CHURCH CENTENARY</title>
		<content>    The members of{Addiewell Parish }  
 Church will never forget 1985. The    
 church was{one hundred years old}that 
 year and many celebrations took place.
 However the year will also be         
 remembered because the joint parish of
 Addiewell and West Calder became no   
 more with West Calder becoming a      
 separate parish. Addiewell has now    
 merged with Stoneyburn, Breich and    
 Longridge. At the moment the new      
 parish does not have a minister but   
 the vacancy has been advertised and   
 should be filled soon.                
         Going back to the centenary,  
 many events took place. For many the  
 highlight was the visit to the church 
 by Lord McLeod  of Fuinary, one of the
 most respected members of the Church  
 of Scotland.                          
    Addiewell Primary School held a    
 very succesful Thanksgiving Service.  </content>
