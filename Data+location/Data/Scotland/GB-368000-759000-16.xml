 Borrowfield property belonged to the  
 Graham family. It was then sold to Mr.

 to it until 1615 when it was sold to  
 Hercules Tailyour. His heirs owned the
 Estate until 1806 when Elizabeth      
 Tailyour, the wife of Robert Renny,   
 died leaving the property to her son

 Newmanswalls property formed part of  
 the ancient hospital grounds of       
 Montrose and was owned by the{Panter  
 family from 1410 to 1636. In 1809 it  
 was sold to Alexander Renny
