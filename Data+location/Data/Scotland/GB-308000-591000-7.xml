		<content>    There is a local bus service on the
 A74 from Lockerbie to Moffat. There   
 are now four buses leaving Lockerbie  
 at 10.45 am, 1.20 pm, 3.45 pm and 5.45
 pm and three leaving Moffat at 11.50  
 am, 3.00 pm and 5.15 pm. These buses  
 are owned by John Creighton of Moffat.
     There is also a bus from          
 Johnstonebridge to Dumfries on a      
 Wednesday, leaving at 9.30am and      
 returning from Dumfries at 2.30pm.    
     Several years ago there used to be
 two buses on a Saturday. One left     
 Johnstonebridge at 1.00pm and one at  
 6.00pm returning at 5.00pm then       
 9.00pm. The evening bus was stopped   
 about 15 years ago and then the       
 afternoon one about five or six years 
 ago. There used to be a bus from Annan
 to Moffat twice a week which ran up   
 the middle through Templand on        
 Wednesday and Saturday.               </content>
