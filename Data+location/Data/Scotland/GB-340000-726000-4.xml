		<content> The Newport on Tay area lies at the   
 mouth of the Firth of Tay. This river 
 is the main feature in the            
 environment. It is tidal at this point
 and very fast and clean.              
   At low tide there are many sandbanks
 and mudflats inhabited by seals,      
 waders, small sea-birds and sea ducks.
 We also get geese in winter. Salmon,  
 sea trout and flatfish can be caught. 
   The banks and shores are stony and  
 hold a lot of semi-precious stones.   
   Behind Wormit and Newport lie wooded
 hills and sheep, cattle and crop      
 farms. The woods are inhabited by     
 small wild birds and mammals; hawks,  
 deer, foxes etc..                     
 The weather is quite dry with low     
 rainfall. In the Spring we get very   
 annoying haars and sea mists because  
 we are near the North Sea. We get     
 little snow.                          </content>
