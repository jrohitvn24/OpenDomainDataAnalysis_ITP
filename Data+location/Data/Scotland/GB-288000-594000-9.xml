		<content> The most common crops on local farms  
 are barley, wheat and oats. In this   
 area the main livestock are sheep and 
 cattle.The types of food which come   
 from these animals are milk, butter,  
 cheese, cream, yoghurt and meat.      
 The most used machinery around the    
 farm are tractors, trailors, combines 
 and landrovers. The tractor's tyres   
 last a very long time as they are     
 usually going over fields or mud      
 tracks.                               
 Drumcork is the biggest dairy farm in 
 the area and Hayfield is the biggest  
 sheep farm.                           
 Most farmers have employees to help   
 them, also his wife who feeds horses  
 and other animals.
