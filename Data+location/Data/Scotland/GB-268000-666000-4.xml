		<content> The houses in the Townhead estate, and
 in the Easterhouse estate, are almost 
 entirely owned by the district        
 councils and rented to tenants.       
 Townhead is typical of Coatbridge,    
 which has over 80% of its households  
 living in local authority housing.    
 There is a strip of owner-occupied    
 housing built along the E-W Townhead  
 Road in the 1930s, but in the 1950s   
 the large council estate was built    
 over what was until then farmland.    
 Most of the estate is two-storey      
 housing, with semi-detacheds and      
 terracing : at the western edge near  
 the golf course are some single-storey
 old people's sheltered houses ; and in
 the centre of the estate is Witchwood 
 Court, a multi-storey block. Although 
 Coatbridge has ten such blocks, this  
                                       
                                       </content>
