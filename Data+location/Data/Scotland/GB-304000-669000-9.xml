		<title>09HOUSING IN KNIGHTSRIDGE</title>
		<content>   The Knightsridge area of Livingston 
 consists of approximately 1100 houses.
 Most of the houses were built for the 
 Livingston Development Corporation for
 renting and only a few were built by  
 private builders. Work was started in 
 August 1971 and the first houses were 
 completed by the middle of 1972.      
   Most of the houses are terraced     
 villas of varying sizes from two to   
 seven apartments. There are small     
 houses at ground level for pensioners 
 and some two storey flats. Over the   
 years the people who live in these    
 houses have been complaining about    
 dampness and about the houses being   
 difficult to heat in winter.          
  There is at present a new scheme to  
 help the residents of Knightsridge.It 
 is called the Knightsridge Initiative 
 and should mean considerable changes  
 in the next few years.                </content>
