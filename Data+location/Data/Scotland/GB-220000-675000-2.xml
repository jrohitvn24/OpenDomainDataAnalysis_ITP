		<content> There is very little Industry in the  
 Greenock South West / Gourock West    
 area.                                 
 It is basically a Residential Area.   
 There are however two Industrial      
 Concerns situated in the Larkfield    
 area of Greenock.National Semi        
 Conductors is the main Employer in the
 area.Like many other Firms in Central 
 Scotland involved in the Electronics  
 Business the Company has decreased its
 output over the last few years.This   
 has resulted in a reduction of the    
 work force.At its peak the factory    
 employed some 1800 employees.Today    
 (Oct 85) there are only just over 900 
 employees.The only other insustrial   
 concern in the area is a small unit   
 belonging to the huge                 
 I.B.M.complex,but this is only a store
 employing very few people.
