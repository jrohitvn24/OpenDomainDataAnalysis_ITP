		<title>09WATER SUPPLY EDINBURGH</title>
		<content> In our block we have the main water   
 treatment plants for the city of      
 Edinburgh. These are at Fairmilehead  
 and Alnwickhill, and to the West      
 the old source at Comiston Springs.   
 These water works are on high ground  
 overlooking the city which helps keep 
 a good pressure in the taps in our    
 homes. Water is piped from the main   
 supply at Talla Reservoir about 40    
 miles to the South in the Border      
 Hills.                                
 The water is filtered through gravel  
 and sand to remove impurities and then
 treated chemically to make sure it is 
 safe to drink. At Fairmilehead there  
 is the main office from where the     
 engineers and workmen are controlled. 
 Many of the small reservoirs round    
 Edinburgh are used to control the     
 water level in the burns and give an  
 extra supply in an emergency.         </content>
