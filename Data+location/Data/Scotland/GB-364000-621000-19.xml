		<title>19THE GREAT FLOOD</title>
		<content>     {Saturday, 3rd November,1984.     
 It is hard to believe that no one was 
 drowned that day Jed played West of   
 Scotland.The main flooding was around 
 Bankend,Butler's garage,Thuleknit and 
 Riverside.The Jed overflowed at       
 Bankend and roared up the A68 to the  
 Jedforest north car park.             
   During the game,Elliot Park flooded 
 and it was those who lingered in the  
 bar after the match who were caught.  
 They were rescued by a four wheel     
 drive tractor and trailer.Two cars    
 trying to escape from the car park    
 were carried into a gully by the force
 of water turning off tha A68.The      
 drivers were hauled out only in the   
 nick of time.The Riverside premises   
 were extensively damaged by the water.
  The worst of the flooding occurred   
 around 6.30 in the darkness of the    
 November night.                       </content>
