		<content> 1Much of the life at home centres     
 around mealtimes. Generally speaking, 
 most families spend their day at work 
 in the office, in the factory or at   
 school. The main exception to this is 
 the mother who stays at home to look  
 after young children.                 
{FOOD AND PREPARATION }The modern      
 kitchen makes the preparation and     
 storing of food a simple task.        
 Cookers, fridges and freezers all help
 to make the task of cooking less time 
 consuming.                            
{HOME ENTERTAINMENT}The television     
 plays an important role in family     
 life. A large proportion of the       
 evening is spent watching programmes  
 tailored for all ages and interests.  
{PETS }Many families keep pets. Dogs,  
 cats, budgies and tropical fish are   
 popular.                              
                                       </content>
