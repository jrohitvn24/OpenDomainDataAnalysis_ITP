		<title>05DISTANT HORIZONS</title>
		<content>      Looking northwards from the      
 shores of Lochryan, at Stranraer, we  
 are looking up to the Firth of Clyde. 
 The first thing we are confronted with
 on the horizon is the mighty bulk of  
 The Ailsa Craig, 940 feet in height   
 and 15 miles away.At a distance of    
 some 30 miles, the hills of Arran are 
 sharply outlined and finally is the   
 more distant coastline of the Mull of 
 Kintyre.On Lochryan itself yachting   
 was a popular pastime. The local      
 lairds and landowners held 2 and 3 day
 regattas.Older residents of the town  
 still talk nostalgically of the fine  
 sights they have seen.Now there are   
 smaller yachts, dinghies and          
 windsurfers on the Loch which give    
 cosiderable pleasure to those who     
 participate and also to those who     
 spectate on the shores of Lochryan.
