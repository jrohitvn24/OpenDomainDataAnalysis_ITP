		<content> The Gelston Estate Gamekeeper is Mr J 
 Carson. He lives on the estate with   
 his wife. One of his most time        
 consuming jobs is rearing pheasants.  
 In the spring he has to start         
 collecting about the last week in     
 February as the breeding season is    
 from early March till mid summer. He  
 pens breeding pairs in February and   
 then collects the fertile eggs to be  
 put under the incubator. They take 28 
 days to hatch. The birds are let free 
 at 6 weeks of age. 20% of the pheasant
 hens raise their own offspring.       
 He has about 12 ferrets which he uses 
 for catching rabbits. There are a     
 large number of badgers and minks.    
 There are also some deer.
