		<title>03AUCHMOUNTAIN GLEN GREENOCK</title>
		<content> The {Auchmountain Glen}is situated in 
 the Strone area of {Greenock}. The    
 Auchmountain Burn runs through it and 
 there are many waterfalls.            
 In 1887 the {Belville Boys} who were a
 group of unemployed shipyard workers, 
 cleared and landscaped the land.      
 There were seats to sit on.  There    
 were also figureheads, one of which   
 was {Lord Nelson}.                    
 Since {1945} however, the Glen has    
 been neglected and has become         
 overgrown.  The statues have been     
 broken and the seats vandalised.      
 The Auchmountain Glen depended on {   
{voluntary help} to keep it in order.  
 More people would use the Glen if it  
 was improved as there is no traffic   
 and it is quite safe.  People like to 
 go there for walks, sunbathing and for
 rest.
