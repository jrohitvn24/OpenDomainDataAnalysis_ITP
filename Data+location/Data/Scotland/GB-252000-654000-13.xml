		<content>{TV}is used every day in our homes. We 
 watch many programs like Dallas and   
 Grange Hill                           
{Videos}When we go out we do not have  
 to worry about missing our favourite  
 programmes because we record them on  
 video recorders. These videos are also
 usdeful because we can rent out good  
 films from a video library            
{Radio}Most people have radios in their
 homes. We listen to music or to people
 talking. There are many different     
 channels.                             
{Kettle}With a kettle we can boil cold 
 water for tea or coffee.              
{Record Players} We can play records on
 a record player. They can be pop or   
 classical music. We prefer the pop    
 songs.                                
{Cooker}There are electric cookers and 
 gas cookers. We are not allowed to use
 these cookers as they are dangerous.  </content>
