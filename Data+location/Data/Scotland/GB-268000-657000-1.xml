		<title>01INTRODUCTION</title>
		<content>    The great survey of 1087, now known
 as the{Domesday Book,}described an    
 England of two peoples, a dominant    
 Norman aristocracy and the native     
 English. This contrast is reflected in
{Blantyre High's}contribution to the   
 Domsday Project nine centuries later. 
 We examine{ Blantyre}and{Bothwell}    
 villages separated only by the the    
 River Clyde, yet very different.      
{Bothwell}is a conservation area,      
 sought after by the house - buyer,    
 while{Blantyre}is an area             
 of deprivation with high unemployment;
 Bothwells history features the        
 aristocratic Earls,whle Blantyre's    
 fame rest on the working class figure 
 of Dr. Livinstone.                    
{Domesday Book}was sometimes used as   
 legal evidence; our work may not prove
 as definitive, but has much to offer  
 to those interested inthe two villages</content>
