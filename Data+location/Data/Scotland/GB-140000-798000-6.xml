		<title>06KINLOCH CASTLE,RHUM_INTRO.</title>
		<content> Kinloch Castle is situated at the head
 of Loch Scresort. It took 5 years to  
 build &amp; was finished in 1902 at an    
 estimated cost of Â£250,000. It is a   
 square building with turrets and a    
 high tower over the main entrance.    
 Sandstone, cut &amp; shaped on Arran, was 
 used. Sir George Bullough, the owner, 
 a Lancashire man, brought the builders
 with him.                             
                                       
 There is a glass covered walk_way     
 round the outside, and a large        
 conservatoy was build on the south    
 side where all kinds of plants were   
 grown &amp; exotic caged birds were kept. 
 It is not a castle in the true sense  
 but a large mansion built as a holiday
 home.                                 
                                       
 The Castle is now run as a hotel by   
 the Nature Conservancy Council.       </content>
