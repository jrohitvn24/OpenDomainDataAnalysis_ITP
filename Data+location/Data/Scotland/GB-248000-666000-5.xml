		<content> Renfrew District is a{Special         
{Development Area.}The need for this   
 special help arises from the recent   
 rapid decline of many of the          
 traditional industries, eg ship-      
 building activity and its ancillary   
 industries have completely disappeared
 from the area in the last 5 years.    
 Today the{main employers}of labour are
 Local Administration (60%); Babcock   
 Power (15%) and Glasgow Airport (8%). 
 Babcock Power, a major British boiler 
 manufacturer, exports its boilers     
 world wide, mainly to be used in power
 stations. In 1985 because the economic
 climate the Company has announced a   
 15% cut back in its workforce. This   
 will badly affect the town where there
 is already rising unemployment. The   
 company has just won a Â£1m order to   
 build parts for Trident submarines    
 which may provide future employment.  </content>
