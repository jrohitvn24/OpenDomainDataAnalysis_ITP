		<content>  The EFG is a  company who look after 
 trees for private owners.They look    
 after them for 2 or 3 years.By that   
 time they are a little bigger.But the 
 EFG still keep an eye on young trees  
 until they are about five or six years
 old and then they leave the trees to  
 grow.                                 
 The EFG has to keep the deer numbers  
 down by shooting them and they freeze 
 them in a big freezer in a shed near  
 the EFG offices and then when they are
 frozen they sell them.                
 The EFG shoot the deer because the    
 deer eat the bark off the trees. This 
 is the same problem as the Forestry   
 Commission.The trees are planted to   
 about 350 metres and the deer graze   
 near the top. The deer are very fond  
 of young, juicy trees!
