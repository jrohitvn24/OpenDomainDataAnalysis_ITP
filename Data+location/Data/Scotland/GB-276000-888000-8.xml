		<content> The most convenient way to travel in  
 our area is by car. Most families have
 a car. The nearest main road is the   
 A9. The roads are single track with   
 passing places from Dornoch to Embo   
 and from Dornoch to Cyderhall. There  
 is no direct rail service to Dornoch. 
 The station used most by the local    
 people is Ardgay which is 14 miles    
 away. Highland Omnibuses run a sparce 
 local service, but there is a daily   
 fast bus service to Inverness. The    
 Highland Region provides transport by 
 bus or by taxi for many pupils from   
 outlying areas to school in Dornoch.  
 There is an unlicensed grass airstrip 
 on the Dornoch Links. The biggest     
 plane to land carries 14 passengers.  
 Sometimes golfers arrive in small     
 private aircraft to take part in golf 
 tournaments. In 1986 work will start  
 on a bridge across the Dornoch Firth. </content>
