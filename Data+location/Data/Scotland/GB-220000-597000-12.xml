		<title>12A Girvan Miner Remembers</title>
		<content>  Coal mining is still a dangerous     
 occupation, but was particulary so in 
 the past.                             
  One of the reasons for this was the  
 wooden beams which were used to       
 support the roof of the mine.  Mr Fyfe
 a retired miner who worked at Maxwell 
 collery told us the height of the roof
 changed daily as the timbers moved.   
  Also dangerous were gases such as    
 firedamp and black damp.  The former  
 could cause explosions in the shafts, 
 the latter contained no oxygen and    
 suffocated the miners.  So to test for
 gases miners used to carry caged      
 canaries.                             
  Mr Fyfe also told us that Romilly    
 pit near Dailly used pit ponies to    
 bring the coal to the surface and when
 one of the shafts, closed by flooding 
 for 100 years, was opened, the miners 
 discovered bottles shovels and stables</content>
