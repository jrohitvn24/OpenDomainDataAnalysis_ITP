 beautiful surrounding country, as well
 as pony trekking. The pony trekking   
 costs Â£6.50 for two hours and treks   
 can be up to Castle Varrich or perhaps
 round the Kyle.                       
 Apart from Lundies there are two      
 hotels and many of the local ladies   
 open their homes for bed &amp; breakfast  
 for visitors in the summer months.    
 Most of the visitors come for peace   
 and quietness and clean mountain      
 air.Most are interested in hill       
 walking. bird watching, flower spot   
 ting or fishing. Many have holiday    
 homes in the area and come very year  
 for several weeks.
