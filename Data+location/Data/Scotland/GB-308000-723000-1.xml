		<title>01PERTH AT A GLANCE</title>
		<content>  Perth lies on the banks of the{River 
{Tay}in eastern Scotland.It has a twin 
 town in Germany called Aschaffenburg. 
 To the north east lie the{SIDLAW HILLS
 with{KINNOULL HILL}overlooking the    
 town.To the south are the{OCHIL HILLS 
 creating a valley site which forms the
{GATEWAY TO THE HIGHLANDS.}            
  The town's history dates back to     
 Roman times when  there was only a    
 small camp named{BERTHA;}now Perth has
 about 47,000 inhabitants.The Romans   
 claimed that the river was good for   
 salmon fishing; it is still so today. 
  Perth is often referred to as{THE    
{FAIR CITY}perhaps because Sir Walter  
 Scott wrote{'THE FAIR MAID OF PERTH'.}
  For many years Perth was the capital 
 of Scotland and monarchs were crowned 
 at nearby Scone
