		<title>08WOMEN'S GUILD RALLY</title>
		<content> For an island of just over 300 people 
 the arrival of another 300 is quite an
{event.                                
 This happened on the{6th of June 1985.
 The occasion was the annual Rally of  
 the{Women's Guild}in Orkney.Usually   
 this takes place on the mainland of   
 Orkney.For the first time the Rally   
 was being held in{Shapinsay.}For weeks
 in advance,the ladies of the Guild    
 were making plans.Everyone who had a  
 car was persuaded to chauffeur from   
 the pier to the church.The car park   
 was chock-a-block.The guests arrived  
 on the Orcadia.In almost every kitchen
 there was a taste bud tingling aroma  
 of freshly baked buns,sponges and bere
 bannocks.In addition mountains of     
 sandwiches were provided.That         
 afternoon the{church}was decorated    
 with garden flowers of many kinds.    
 The evening was a huge success.       </content>
