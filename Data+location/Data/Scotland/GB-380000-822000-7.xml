		<title>07Intensive farming in Bourtie</title>
		<content> There are two farmers with over 1000  
 acres in Bourtie, but mos of the farms
 run by the older generation are around
 the 200 acre size.  Many farmers with 
 larger vistas, i.e. those below the   
 500 feet level, have in the last five 
 yars removed the boundaries of        
 drystane dykes (dry stone walls) where
 the land has allowed.  But most of the
 smaller farmers have kept the dykes   
 because they provide shelter and show 
 points of reference which can be used 
 to trace old water and drainage       
 courses.  Where the larger-acreage    
 farmers have benefitted inopening up  
 land for heavier equipment to         
 cultivate or harvest, they have lost  
 in damaged drains and natural water   
 supplies.  One farmer uprooted all    
 they dykes inside a 100 acre stretch; 
 then had to import mechanical diggers 
 to provide the hillside with drainage.</content>
