		<title>07FARMING IN BADENOCH - 4</title>
		<content>{1985}has brought news of farms being  
 sold and farmers trust their leases   
 will be renewed. Buyers must be found 
 who will agree to lease back the      
{shooting rights}on the hills as the   
 sellers wish to retain these rights as
 a source of income as well as for     
 personal use.                         
                                       
 Land along the river is being sold and
 it is hoped that the neighbouring     
{R.S.P.B.}will add it to their Bird    
 Reserve at Insh Marshes.  The present 
 owner talks of draining it but this is
 considered against everybody's        
 interests - perhaps even the farmer's,
 as the soil is poor.
