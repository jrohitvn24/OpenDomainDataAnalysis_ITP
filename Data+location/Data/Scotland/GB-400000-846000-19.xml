		<title>19The Village Policeman</title>
		<content> Before 1967 there were no policemen in
 Mintlaw.The authorities closed        
 Longside,St Fergus and Stuartfield and
 they took all the policemen into      
 Mintlaw police station where there are
 now four constable.There is also one  
 constable at Maud and one at New Deer.
 I transferred from Laurencekirk to    
 Mintlaw in 1982.Mintlaw and its       
 countryside is a law abiding place.I  
 have never used my truncheon.The dogs 
 are called by word of mouth.We charge 
 people,in Mintlaw for reckless        
 driving.I have never been hurt in the 
 line of duty.We always wear uniform   
 at Mintlaw while we are on duty,but   
 other departments in Peterhead do not 
 always were a uniform.We always       
 carry a card for identification where 
 ever we go.
