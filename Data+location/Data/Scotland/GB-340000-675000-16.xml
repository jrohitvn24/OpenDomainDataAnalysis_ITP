		<content> I switched off the alarm,got up and   
 ,in my dressing gown,put the kettle   
 on.I dressed,made my own breakfast and
 while eating it and having a cup of   
 tea,watched {T.V. AM} for a while.Mum 
 stayed in bed today.She had a sore    
 stomach.Dad was in bed as he had just 
 finished {NIGHTSHIFT}.Soon it was time
 to go for the bus to {SCHOOL}.On the  
 way my friends and I spoke of the     
 Liverpool football disaster the night 
 before.After school I did a little    
 weeding in my garden before going in  
 for tea.Mum and dad were up now but   
 dad begins nightshift again at 9      
 o'clock.After some more gardening and 
 watching T.V.I made dad a cup of tea  
 before he went off to work.By 10.30   
 I was in bed {READING}my book for half
 an hour before going to sleep.
