		<title>01BALMACARA SQUARE</title>
		<content>  The inaccesible land to the N>E> of  
 Balmacara Square rises as high as     
 425m, contains many steep slopes, hill
 summits and bare rock outcrops, and is
 extremely hilly in nature. This land  
 is covered by shallow peaty soil which
 can support only poor grassland,      
 heather or forestry. The dominant     
 cover is varied coniferous forest,    
 planted for amenity by the National   
 Trust, who are the main landowners.   
 There is also a rare area of natural  
 oak woodland. Before the Trust arrived
 in 1946, roe deer were s eldom seen.  
 Today they are frequently spotted, as 
 are pine-martens who are now so       
 common, they forage in the square     
 itself. Balmacara Square sits lower   
 down in an area of flatter, better    
 quality land and has a population of  
 84 save 1 farmer and visits from      
 foresters.                            </content>
