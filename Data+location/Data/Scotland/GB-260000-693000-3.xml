		<title>03ARNPRIOR VILLAGES</title>
		<content> Arnprior village has neither church   
 nor pub and the local people have     
 always travelled to Kippen or         
 Buchlyvie for these facilities.But the
 people of Arnprior district feel they 
 belong to neither of these            
 communities,hence their powerful sense
 of communal identity focusses itself  
 to a great extent on the school.The   
 school perforce doubles up as village 
 hall and meeting house,playing host   
 weekly to the youth group and a       
 thriving branch of the Women's Rural  
 Institute.In winter it is used for    
 occasional village ceilidhs and       
 dances,for whist drives and sundry    
 charitable fund raising activities and
 in the spring it houses the annual    
 Bulb Show.Until recently it was used  
 for a monthly evening service.
