		<content> East Wemyss and Buckhaven are situated
 at the mouth of the River Forth which 
 is a busy shipping channel for both   
 commercial and naval vessels. Tankers 
 can always be seen in the Firth of    
 Forth either coming or going from the 
 oil terminals at Braefoot Bay (Dalgety
 Bay) and Hound Point (Forth Bridge).  
 Empty tankers are often seen anchored 
 quite close to the shore, especially  
 in bad weather.                       
 In addition to the tankers there are  
 often Royal Navy boats seen on        
 manouvers in the Firth. The Navy boats
 come from the Royal Navy Base at      
 Rosyth, further up the river past the 
 Forth Bridges.
