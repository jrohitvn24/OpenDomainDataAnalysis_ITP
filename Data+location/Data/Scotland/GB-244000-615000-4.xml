		<title>04PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content> In the playground we play{two         
{different kinds of games.}One type is 
{"Singing games"}and the other is      
{"Chasing games".}Three singing games  
 are;{A sailor went to I-I-I, I went to
{a Chinese baker's shop and Um Pom Pei.
 Two people play these games. They     
 stand face to face and clap their     
 hands in a certain way while singing  
 the rhyme. The{young children}play at 
{Ring O' Roses.}Our{favourite chasing  
{games}are ;{Levo, Aeroplane Tig and   
{Chipped , Cracked and Broken.         
 Aeroplane Tig is called this because  
 when we are touched we stand still    
 with our arms stretched out like the  
 wings of an aeroplane. We are released
 when someone runs under our arms. We  
 also enjoy playing games with definite
 rules such as rounders and football.
