		<title>15FROM SHIPS TO OIL RIGS</title>
		<content> From its origins as a fishing village 
 called Newark, Port Glasgow developed 
 as the port of Glasgow and became a   
 major shipbuilding centre in 19th and 
 20th centuries.  The decision by      
 British Shipbuilders to switch        
 production at {Scott Lithgow} from    
 ships to semi-submersible oil         
 platforms resulted in near tragedy.   
 Trafalgar House, the new private owner
 of the Scott Lithgow Group has also   
 laid off men. Despite tremendous      
 efforts by unions, District Council,  
 churches and the communities of Port  
 Glasgow and Greenock the future       
 remains shrouded in uncertaintity.This
 obviously has a demoralising effect on
 the many skilled workers who remain   
 unemployed. It also means that many   
 talented, energetic young people may  
 have to leave the district to seek    
 their fortunes elsewhere              </content>
