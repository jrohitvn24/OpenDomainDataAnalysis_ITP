 We talked to people.Most people agree 
 with conservation because the         
 buildings around here are old  and    
 they think the place should not be    
 spoiled.Most people have their own    
 transport because the bus service is  
 poor.Everyone likes the area but they 
 wish there was a better bus service   
 and a shop and that the aeroplanes did
 not fly so low.There are retired      
 people and young people and they all  
 say much the same.                    
          The older people use the     
 buses which go to Dunbar and          
 Haddington on Saturdays ,and they use 
 the Tuesday afternoon bus to Dunbar.  
 On other days they can travel to      
 Dunbar on the school bus but that is  
 only in term time.{GENERAL IMPRESSIONS
