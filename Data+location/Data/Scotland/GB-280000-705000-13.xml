		<title>13MY FAVOURITE SPORTS</title>
		<content>   My favourite sports are tennis,     
 swimming and football. I am quite     
 lucky because I am able to play tennis
 on proper, and some of the newest     
 courts. I took up tennis properly     
 while we were on holiday in Spain. We 
 were staying at a tennis coaching     
 centre and I decided that I would like
 to try my hand at it, and I have been 
 improving since then. I really enjoy  
 swimming, especially breast stroke. I 
 have my Scottish Swimmers Award and   
 badges for 50m,100m,200m,400m,800m,&amp;  
 1000m this is as far as we can swim at
 Primary school. We go every week in   
 the Summer term with the school,but I 
 go regularly all year with my parents.
 I started to play football when I got 
 into P4,and was lucky to be substitute
 in Bells Tournament that year.I liked 
 it so much that I've been playing ever
 since. We won the Shield again in June</content>
