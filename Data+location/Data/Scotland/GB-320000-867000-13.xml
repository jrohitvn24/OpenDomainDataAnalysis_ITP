		<title>13TWO CEMETERIES LOSSIEMOUTH</title>
		<content>   The Lossiemouth cemetery has had a  
 large extension built which was opened
 in September 1985. The oldest grave in
 the cemetery is dated 1863. The       
 cemetery is well cared for and        
 has facilities like toilets, seats,   
 shelter, watering cans, bins and taps.
 There are many graves of airmen from  
 Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia
 who fought in World War Two. Their    
 ages range from 19 to 44 but most died
 in their twenties.                    
   Drainie cemetery, which is much     
 smaller, is no longer used. The       
 earliest grave goes back to 1772 and  
 the most recent one is dated 1981. The
 cemetery is well cared for apart from 
 some broken walls. The older grave    
 stones are tilting and sinking and    
 moss covers the writing.
