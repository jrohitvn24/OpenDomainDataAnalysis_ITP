		<title>03MACHINE PEAT CUTTING IN EDAY</title>
		<content>    Recently the local shop has started
 to cut peat by machine on a commercial
 basis.                                
    Before the peat can be cut by      
 machine the heather must be burnt off 
 the top. Then it is left for one or   
 two weeks before the machine can start
 to cut.                               
    The machine that cuts the peat is  
 pulled along behind a tractor. It has 
 a sharp metal disc which cuts the peat
 which is then compressed and the      
 machine drops them on top of the      
 ground where they are left to dry for 
 about three weeks.                    
    When dry the peats are put into    
 sacks and either delivered to houses  
 locally or exported to other islands  
 or the mainland of Orkney.            
    The peats that are cut by machine  
 are shaped like long thick sausages.
