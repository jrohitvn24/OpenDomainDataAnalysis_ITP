		<content>  About 75% of people live in{Council  
{Houses,}and 25% in{private houses.    
  The oldest houses still in use are   
 near the town centres - the towns have
 expanded out into the countryside     
 and few{gap sites}lie empty long.     
  A{typical council house}has 2 or 3   
 bedrooms, a living room, kitchen and  
 bathroom and costs about{Â£72 rent}per 
 month. Council houses are usually     
 terraced or semi-detached, although   
 there are some blocks of flats also.  
  A{typical private house}might have   
 the same accommodation plus a separate
 dining-room and will be more likely to
 be semi-detached. Such a house would  
 cost about Â£27,000 - mortgage payments
 would be{Â£200}per month.              
  Recently the council have started to 
{renovate}older buildings of           
 character instead of demolishing them.
