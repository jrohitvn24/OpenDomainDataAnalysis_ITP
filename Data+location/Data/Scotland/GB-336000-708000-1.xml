		<title>01OVERALL VIEW OF THE AREA</title>
		<content> This is a rural landscape. There are  
 fields and scattered farms all over   
 it.There are only two groupings of    
 houses and both of them are designated
 as "hamlets". There are no footpaths  
 by the roadsides except in Craigrothie
 but those people who wish to enjoy a  
 quiet walk can use one of the several 
 rights of way which are preserved for 
 public use and take you far from any  
 traffic.                              
 It is a very peaceful,quiet looking   
 area but do not be afraid - there's   
 plenty going on.
