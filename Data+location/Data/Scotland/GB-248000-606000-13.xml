		<content> Until 1978 the major source of        
 employment in the Cummock Valley was  
 coal mining.  At its peak there were  
 several collieries with rail links to 
 Dunaskin Waterside in the Doon Valley 
 nearby.  Latterly the workforce       
 travelled in to the last pit-         
 Pennyvenie- as most had moved to      
 better, more modern housing from the  
 old colliery rows.                    
                                       
 Coal extraction is still an employer  
 in the valley.  In 1978 opencast      
 quarrying began up valley below       
 Benbain on the sites of the former    
 Beoch collieries.  While production is
 high few men are required.  The       
 operation taps coal seams traditional 
 mining found either uneconomic or too 
 dangerous to work.  The coal is taken 
 by lorry to the Dunaskin railhead.
