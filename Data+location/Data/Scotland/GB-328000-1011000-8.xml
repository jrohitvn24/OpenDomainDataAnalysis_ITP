		<content> This is the only hotel in the area.It 
 was built at the beginning of this    
 century to encourage people to come to
 Orkney for the excellent trout        
 fishing.Today the hotel has 20 rooms  
 and a maximum of 33 people can be     
 accommodated.Of the guests who stay   
 here 50% come for fishing and 50% for 
 family holidays.Most of the guests    
 book directly and in advance.Few      
 people book through the local tourist 
 office. The busiest months are between
 Easter and August when the            
 hotel employs 6 people.In the winter  
 months only two people are employed.  
 Few people stay during the winter     
 months. At this time of year the      
 hotelier earns his income from the bar
 and bar meals.
