		<content> Let us take a walk down the tow path  
 from Muirtown Bridge.Glenalbyn        
 Distillery across the Basin has been  
 closed for some years.GL11,the        
 gatelifter,lies at the wharf wall.    
 Moored next to it are the Duke of     
 Normandy(the Canal tug boat)and the   
 fishery protection vessel.Donkeys are 
 grazing on our left.Beyond,the toll   
 house on the Clachnaharry road is     
 boarded up.Further along are two piles
 of lock gates made by Lewis's,Aberdeen
 shipbuilders.At the Clachnaharry Works
 electricians,engineers,blacksmiths and
 joiners work to keep the canal as it  
 was long ago.Two Buckie trawlers are  
 in the locks,going home from the West 
 Coast.The men throw us some cod roe.  
 The signalman by the swing bridge     
 calls down.The Kyle train passes.At   
 the Sea Lock Mr.Mackenzie opens the   
 gates by pressing a switch.           </content>
