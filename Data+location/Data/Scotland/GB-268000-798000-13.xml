		<title>13NEWTONMORE CAMANACHD 1</title>
		<content> The game of{shinty}has been played    
 in the district of Badenoch, in which 
{Newtonmore}is situated, for as long as
 there is any record and certainly for 
 more than a thousand years. Coming as 
 it did from the root sport of         
{camanachd - the game of the curved    
{stick}- in Ireland, it has a place in 
 the stories of the Celtic heroes  as  
 well as a growing collection of       
 legends about the many outstanding    
 players who have worn the blue and    
 white hooped jerseys which are famous 
 as the{Newtonmore}colours.            
{Shinty}is a skilful and exacting      
 spectacle. It is played , twelve a    
 side , with a slim-handled            
 curved-headed stick, triangular in    
 section. The ball is about the size of
 a tennis-ball, with a thick leather   
 cover, which travels, at the point of 
 contact at a speed of a 100 m.p.h.    </content>
