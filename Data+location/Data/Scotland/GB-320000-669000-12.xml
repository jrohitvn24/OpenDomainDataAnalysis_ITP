		<title>12LONGSTONE PARK</title>
		<content>  Longstone park is situated between   
 Murrayburn Road, Dumbryden Road and   
 Longstone Road. The E.E.C.(European   
 Economic Community) are giving money  
 to make improvements in the park.     
 Already this has provided new swings, 
 climbing bars and lots of other things
 e.g. seats for people to sit on.      
  Most people who visit the park do    
 live near it, and are aged between    
 twenty-one and forty years old.       
 Housewives visit the park to take     
 their children for a walk. Most people
 we spoke to came daily and just       
 walked, enjoying the open space but   
 disliking the long grass most of all. 
 One person started coming in 1969.    
 Everyone was in favour of the         
 improvements and would like climbing  
 bars,more trees, tennis courts, lights
 sand pits, an enclosed area for       
 children,a roundabout and short grass.</content>
