 Field.   A bequest to the village.    
                                       
 A few years after its inauguration in 
 1978, it was extended by the gift of  
 the remaining part of the field. The  
 facility is now quite magnificient for
 the size of population it serves.     
                                       
 In addition to providing space for    
 boys to informally 'kick a ball', the 
 field is used for organised sport.    
 Currently it is the home ground of {  
{Strathendrick Rugby Club,}enabling    
 good class rugby to be played and seen
 in the village. There is also a lively
 football section, the game being      
 played, parents helping, at{Primary &amp; 
{Under 16 levels.}This season (1985) it
 is proposed to launch a senior team.  
 There is also a section of the field  
 devoted to{horse riding and jumping.  </content>
