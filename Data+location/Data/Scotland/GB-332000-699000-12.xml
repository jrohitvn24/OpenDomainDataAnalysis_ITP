		<title>12MILTON'S MOBILE SHOPS.</title>
		<content>                                       
 Home Life in the village of Milton    
 differs from that in towns.We studied 
 services to villages and concentrated 
 on the mobile shops.Those without cars
 depend on these or the Post Office/   
 shop for food.Prices are dearer than  
 in Markinch 4kms away or Glenrothes   
 7km west,but bus fares cost 46p single
 for adults,half for children.The Co-op
 van brings{rolls and milk}every       
 morning,then{bakery goods}and a few   
{groceries}three times each week.Green 
 (butcher) and the Co-op bring{meat}3  
 days each.A{greengrocer}calls Monday, 
 Wednesday and Friday and the{fish}man 
 Tuesday,Thursday and Saturday.The{fish
{and chip}van comes on Friday nights.  
{Ice cream}vans call every evening.    
 Milton has a pub,primary school,church
 and village hall,but no doctor,dentist
 or nurse,and no bank or any shop.     </content>
