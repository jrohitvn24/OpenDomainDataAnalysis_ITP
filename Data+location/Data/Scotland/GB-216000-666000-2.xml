		<title>021ST. DEVELOPMENT,SKELMORLIE</title>
		<content>  Skelmorlie has developed in 3 dis-   
 tinct phases,each phase having added  
 to the present character of our com-  
 munity.                               
  The 1st phase of development took    
 place between 1840-1900 when rich     
 Victorians and Edwardians decided to  
 build{summer}homes along the Clyde.   
  They built red sandstone mansions    
 with servants wings and coach-houses. 
 The family,friends and servants would 
 move down for the whole summer.With   
 the opening of the Hydropathic        
 Establishment,Skelmorlie became       
 a fashionable resort.                 
  The two World  Wars put an end to the
 rich leisured life and the houses were
 too large for 1 family.The biggest of 
 the houses became convalescent homes, 
 hotels and church holiday centres,    
 while the smaller houses were         
 converted into flats.                 </content>
