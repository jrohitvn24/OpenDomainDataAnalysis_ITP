		<content> The two old barges wrecked in Primrose
 bay are two old coal barges.the barges
 were wrecked one day in a very rough  
 storm ,the barges are now in about    
 1-3ft deep water.The barges used to be
 upright many years ago,but are now    
 leaning to one side,one barge rests   
 on the other.You could get over to    
 them,but be careful to choose a time  
 when the water is shallow,because     
 sometimes the water is deep,usually   
 after a heavy rainfall.You could get  
 over by boat.To see them you go       
 through Aldourie Woods and keep going 
 until you come to two three roads     
 going in different directions,you take
 the road going downhill on the        
 right.When you come to the bay you can
 see them from there.To get oppsite    
 them you take a small path through the
 heather and plants,you will come to a 
 sandy patch,from their you can cross. </content>
