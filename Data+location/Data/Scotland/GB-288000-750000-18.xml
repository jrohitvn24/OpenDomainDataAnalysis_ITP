		<content> Fishing. The average caught in a year 
 on one short stretch of the river at  
 Grandtully,was 200 to 250. They always
 fished with fly rods.                 
{Grouse}were also shot in huge numbers 
 in the area. Now much of the hillsides
 are covered in trees.                 
{The schools}were very different to    
 what they are now.At Lady Steuart's   
 School,near Grandtully Church,the     
 children got soup for their lunch only
 in the winter time.It was made at     
 Westpark and was carried down to the  
 school in a tin. Every Christmas the  
 children were measured for a cloak.   
 This was a gift from Lady Steuart and 
 was to keep the children warm         
 throughout the winter.
