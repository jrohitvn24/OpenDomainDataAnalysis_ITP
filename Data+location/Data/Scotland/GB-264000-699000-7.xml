		<title>07THORNHILL THE STIRLING CARSE</title>
		<content> The Carse of Stirling was carved out  
 during the ice-age.When the glaciers  
 melted,the land was below sea         
 level.The sea came in and covered the 
 land and when it retreated,it left a  
 cover of rich alluvial soil.The carse,
 therefore,is very wide,flat and       
 fertile.It is famous for growing      
 Timothy hay,the best of this heavy    
 crop being sold for seed.Other crops  
 grown are wheat and barley.The River  
 Forth meanders across the carse and   
 the Goodie Water flows into it about  
 three and a half miles east of our    
 block.The village of Thornhill sits   
 above the carse,looking down over it. 
 Netherton and Norrieston farms are    
 typical carse farms.About September,  
 flocks of geese arrive from the Tundra
 lands of the north to spend the       
 winter.The carse is approx.10 miles   
 long and averages 4 miles in width.   </content>
