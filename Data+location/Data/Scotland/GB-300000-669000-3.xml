		<title>03DECHMONT VILLAGE WEST</title>
		<content> The west part of Dechmont Village is  
 in our block. Housing in this         
 attractive village is owned either by 
{Bangour}Hospital,the Local Council or 
 privately owned.The older houses are  
 mostly terraced but the more modern   
 housing(10-15 years old) is           
 semi-detached or detached. The village
 has an{Infant School}built in 1913    
 with an extension added in 1962. The  
 previous school for this area(Log Book
 starts in 1888)was at Craig Binning   
 but a new school had to be found      
 because of an infestation of rats.    
 Although the Infant School only has   
 around twenty pupils it has taught    
 five different{nationalities}at one   
 time. After their infant schooling at 
 Dechmont the pupils move to Kirkhill  
 Primary School in Broxburn which is   
 three miles east of the village.
