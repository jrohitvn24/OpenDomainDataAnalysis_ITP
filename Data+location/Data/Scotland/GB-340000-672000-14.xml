 TRANENT during and after the first    
 world war.There was much poverty and  
 most men worked in the pits while the 
 women worked in the fields or in      
 service.Where the war memorial now    
 stands was a trough for horses.Life   
 was hard but people were more closely 
 knit.{1939-45-Mrs Luby 85 Mrs Baptie  
{62 Mrs Muir 76yrs.}Memories of the war
 were both happy and sad.The war       
 brought people closer together.Food   
 was rationed and when local men were  
 killed the whole town mourned.They all
 agreed that even though life was tough
 they had a great life.{1953 Coronation
{Elizabeth 11 }-{Mrs.Plain 86yrs    }  
 remembers the street parties held then
 Everybody was singing and dancing and 
 the children were given a coronation  
 mugs and sweets.She watched the       
 ceremony on T.V. for the first time.  </content>
