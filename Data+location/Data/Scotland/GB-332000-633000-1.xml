		<content> THE TRAQUAIR AREA LIES IN TWEEDALE,   
 ONE OF THE FOUR DISTRICTS OF THE      
 BORDERS REGION IN SCOTLAND. THE AREA  
 IS ENTIRELY RURAL BUT LIES WITHIN A   
 SHORT DISTANCE OF INNERLEITHEN, A     
 SMALL INDUSTRIAL TOWN.                
 THE WHOLE AREA IS VERY HILLY AND      
 SCENICALLY ATTRACTIVE, RISING FROM

 TWEED TO OVER 470M ABOVE SEA LEVEL.   
 THE HILLSIDES ARE STEEP AND MAINLY    
 NORTH-FACING. OVER HALF OF THE BLOCK  
 IS COVERED WITH CONIFEROUS            
 PLANTATIONS, MAINLY OWNED BY THE      
 FORESTRY COMMISSION, AND THE REST OF  
 THE LAND IS USED FOR AGRICULTURE,     
 MAINLY UPLAND SHEEP PASTURE. TRAQUAIR 
 ITSELF IS VERY SMALL HAMLET,          
 CONSISTING OF A LOOSE CLUSTER OF      
 COTTAGES BUT WITH NO FACILITIES OTHER 
 THAN A TELEPHONE KIOSK AND A LETTER   
 BOX.                                  </content>
