		<title>17IRVINE * MARYMASS FAIR (1)</title>
		<content>{                                      
{The Marymass fair}dates back to the   
 12th century, but the horse races     
 which are held after the crowning     
 ceremony, and procession on Irvine    
 Moor, are over a thousand years old   
 and may be the oldest in Europe.      
       It begins every year in Irvine  
 on either the third or fourth Saturday
 in August, and lasts a week.The{name  
{of the fair}comes from the parish     
 church which was dedicated to the     
 Virgin Mary, but later it became      
 associated with Mary Queen of Scots,  
 which is why the Marymass Queen is    
 always dressed as Queen Mary.         
           On the Sunday before the    
 fair there is a church service,and    
 during the next week a Gala day takes 
 place, with racing, a gymkhana, a     
 football match and fireworks.
