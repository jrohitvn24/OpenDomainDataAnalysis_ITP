		<content> Although a rural community 25% travel 
 to work.{Labour relations}are good and
 strikes virtually unheard of. At      
 present there is no unemployment. 57% 
 of those working in Deerness are      
 engaged in{farming,}with the other    
{local employment}being a sub Post     
 Office, General Merchant, tourism,    
 Food Processor, builder, knitwear     
 manufacturer and service industries.  
 Those who{travel to work}include      
 clerical staff, driving instructor,   
 builders, joiners, nurses, teachers,  
 drivers and oil related workers. Many 
 farming families{supplement their     
{income}by letting houses to tourists, 
 lobster fishing, fish farming, casual 
 labour and knitting. A great many of  
 the people over 65 farm to a lesser   
 extent by renting out fields. Greater 
 use of machinery means that fewer     
 people are needed to farm the area.   </content>
