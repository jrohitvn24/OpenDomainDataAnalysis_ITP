		<content>   The R.A.F. Search and Rescue service
 has been here in Lossiemouth since    
 1979. There are four people in a crew 
 and they can take seventeen survivors 
 in the helicopter. They have two Sea  
 King helicopters which each have a    
 range of 270 miles.                   
   The readiness time during the day is
 fifteen minutes but at night it is    
 forty-five minutes. The team are on   
 call twenty-four hours a day, every   
 day.                                  
   The main reason for having a Search 
 and Rescue service is to rescue R.A.F.
 men who eject from a plane that they  
 are flying. The service is called out 
 to rescues about once every three     
 days, about one hundred and twenty    
 times a year. The other types of      
 rescue they do are rescues in the     
 mountains, particularily in winter,   
 from the sea and from the cliffs.     </content>
