		<title>19Rogart - Transport (Railway)</title>
		<content>  Mr Mackay, Acheilidh, is the station 
 manager. Fourteen men are employed by 
 British Rail in Rogart. Eleven of them
 keep the railway line in good         
 condition while the other three man   
 the station.                          
  Daily, except Sunday, six passenger  
 trains and two goods trains use this  
 request stop. Passengers indicate to  
 the train driver if they wish him to  
 stop. Trains go north to Wick or      
 Thurso and suoth to Inverness.        
  The station has been open for a      
 hundred years. In the summer,trains   
 travel seven days a week. Sometimes,  
 British Rail's Highland answer to the 
 Orient Express pulls into Rogart.     
  The points in Rogart are worked by a 
 key system. This system prevents more 
 than one train being in the system at 
 one time.
