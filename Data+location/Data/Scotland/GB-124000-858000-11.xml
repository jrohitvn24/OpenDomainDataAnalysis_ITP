		<content> A point of local interest is Trumpan  
 Church; dating to pre-Reformation     
 times. The altar was at the east end. 
 The congregation was Roman Catholic.  
 On May 15 1578, while the people, who 
 were of the Clan Macleod, were at     
 worship, the thatched roof was set    
 alight by members of the Clan         
 Macdonald from Uist. This was a       
 revenge attack. One woman escaped and 
 raised the alarm. A battle ensued.    
 Many Macdonalds were killed; so many  
 in fact that they could not be buried 
 separately. The bodies were lined up  
 against a dyke, which was then knocked
 over on top of them. It was known as  
 the Battle of the Spoilt Dyke. Buried 
 here too is Lady Grange, sister-in-law
 of the Earl of Mar, who raised the    
 Jacobite Rebellion in 1715. She, a    
 Hanoverian, threatened to betray them.
