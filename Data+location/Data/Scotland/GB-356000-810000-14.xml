		<content>{Muir of fowlis post office and shop.  
 The shop was built in 1840 and became 
 a post office in 1850.As the owners   
 cottage is attached to the shop       
 opening hours are flexible being 8am  
 to 6.30pm and 10am to 2pm on Sunday.  
 The areas of Tough,Cushnie,Craigievar,
 Glen-kindie and Muir of Fowlis are    
 served by the shop,which sells        
 everything from groceries to paraffin 
 and animal feed.Customers travel from 
 as far away as Elgin and Inverness to 
 buy home made cheese, peas meal and   
 free range eggs.                      
 Mail deliveries are difficult in      
 winter as isolated farms are often    
 snow-bound for days and the whole     
 community may have to rely on the shop
 for supplies. It is also the local    
 centre for information and gossip,the 
 postmistress knows everyone and plays 
 an essential role in the community.   </content>
