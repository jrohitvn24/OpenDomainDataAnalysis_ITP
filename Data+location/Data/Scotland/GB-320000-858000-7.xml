		<title>07The Cattle Mart.</title>
		<content>  The cattle mart is held every Friday 
 morning in Elgin. At the mart, people 
 come from farms all over the Elgin and
 Birnie area to buy and sell cattle.   
 Mostly  young heifers are bought at   
 the mart. There is a small ring where 
 the cows are paraded around so that   
 the buyers have a good look at them.  
 The auctioneer keeps up a constant    
 babble of numbers which only the      
 farmers seem able to understand.      
 Farmers make their bids by winking or 
 raising a finger. With every bid the  
 auctioneer increases the price until  
 there are no more bids and he bangs a 
 piece of wood onto his desk. Later the
 cows are loaded onto lorries and taken
 to their new farms.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
