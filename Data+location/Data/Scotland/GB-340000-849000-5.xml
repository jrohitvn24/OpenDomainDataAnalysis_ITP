		<title>05 Farming in the Keith area</title>
		<content>The farming around Keith is mainly     
mixed farming with both crops and      
livestock important.Barley is the main 
cereal crop.Much grass is grown to be  
made into silage or hay for feeding to 
livestock in winter,along with turnips.
The livestock consists mainly of beef  
cattle and sheep.Most of the cattle are
Hereford-Friesian crosses and many are 
also cross-bred with continental bulls 
such as the Limousin and Charolais.On  
higher land where grazing is poorer,   
more sheep are kept.Main breeds include
the Blackface,Leicester and Suffolk.The
lambs are mostly sold for meat apart   
from some ewe lambs which are kept for 
breeding.There is a livestock mart in  
Keith where cattle and sheep are bought
and sold.                              
 Near Keith there are two dairy farms -
Drum Farm and Birkenburn which supply  
fresh milk to the local area.          </content>
