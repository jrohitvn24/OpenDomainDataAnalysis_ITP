		<title>01IMMIGRATION TO MONKLANDS</title>
		<content> Much of the area at the SE of the     
 study area is part of Monklands       
 District. Many people from all over   
 the world have their roots in the     
 Monklands, whereas only 4% of         
 Monklanders have their roots outside  
 Scotland. Industrial growth brought   
 many emigrants from Ireland in the    
 last century, creating a population   
 explosion. Monklands has the largest  
 Roman Catholic community of any       
 Scottish district, accounting for     
 nearly 56% of the Coatbridge people.  
 In recent yaers however the decline of
 our traditional mining and ironworking
 industries has lead to mass           
 unemployment,forcing people to move in
 search of work and a better life. A   
 recent survey carried out in the 3rd  
 year of Coatbridge High School        
                                       
                                       </content>
