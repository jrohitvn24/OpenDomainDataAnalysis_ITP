		<title>06FORESTRY _ CONTD</title>
		<content> The foresters try to protect their    
 young plantation by wire but smaller  
 animals ofcourse can still cause      
 problems.  Although there are few     
 hares, they do untold damage by       
 cutting the leading shoots of the     
 trees _ comically leaving them        
 uneaten.  Woodvoles chew at the bark  
 in winter.                            
    There are two sales per year.      
 Trees are sold in bulk.  The main     
 buyer being Gordons of Fraserburgh    
 although sawmills locally are         
 supplied, especially those at         
 Longside.  The produce is used for    
 pulp and exported to Scandinavia.     
    The Forestry Commision in this area
 is staffed by six men, five of whom   
 are permanent, but there are many men 
 on site, felling under contract       
 supplying up to twenty men and        
 lorries.                              </content>
