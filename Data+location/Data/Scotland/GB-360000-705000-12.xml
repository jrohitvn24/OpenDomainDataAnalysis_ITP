		<content> There are 7 classes in my primary and 
 22 children in my class. We learn     
 Maths, English &amp; Social Studies. I    
 like Maths and gym best. Visiting     
 teachers take gym,art and music. 5    
 girls learn violin. You can have      
 dinner at school or bring a packed    
 lunch. We have three playtimes,staying
 indoors if rainy. We can buy crisps   
 and all children get free milk.       
 On Friday we have a service and sings 
 hymns and pray.  We get sewing, craft 
 work and homework but not on Friday.  
 Sometimes we go on school trips to a  
 zoo or museum or once to a Post       
 Office.  We have a sale and a         
 Christmas Party.  There are T.V>      
 programmes, films and video tapes and 
 we have a library.  In summer we get  
 six weeks holiday.
