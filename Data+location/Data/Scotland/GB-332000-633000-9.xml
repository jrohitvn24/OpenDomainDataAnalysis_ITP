		<content> THE HOME WAS SEARCHED. IN LATER YEARS 
 A CHAPEL WAS MADE ON THE GROUND FLOOR.
 (IN THE DAYS WHEN THE SCOTS AND       
 ENGLISH BORDERERS MADE RAIDS TO STEAL 
 EACH OTHERS CATTLE, THE CELLARS OF THE
 HOUSE WERE USED FOR KEEPING THE       
 ANIMALS IN SAFETY) THE BREWING OF ALE 
 HAS BEEN A TRADITION IN MOST LARGE    
 HOUSES AND IT IS STILL MADE NOW ABOUT 
 ONCE A MONTH USING THE 200 YEAR OLD   
 VESSELS. TRAQUAIR HOUSE ALE IS VERY   
 POPULAR AND IS SOLD AS FAR AFIELD AS  
 THE UNITED STATES.
