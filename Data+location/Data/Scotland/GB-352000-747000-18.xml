		<content>   In a survey of our school families  
 it was discovered that only 2% of     
 those families participating, had no  
 car.The high percentage of cars owned 
 in the village,98% was due to the     
 inadequate bus service.               
   60% owned one car per family while a
 further 30% owned two cars and as many
 people work out of the village, this  
 is hardly surprising.It is unusual,   
 however,that 8% own three or more     
 cars.                                 
   The inconvenience of the bus service
 is torture.If you wish to go to the   
 public baths or shopping out of Letham
 you have to plan it ahead carefully or
 you could miss the buses which        
 sometimes fail to stop.We are all     
 hoping that our bus service improves  
 soon.
