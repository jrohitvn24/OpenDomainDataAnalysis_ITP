		<title>17LAW &amp; ORDER in GLAMIS</title>
		<content>     There is a Police Office in Glamis
 with a resident Constable.  Another   
 constable and a special constable     
 reside in the area, as does a J.P. and
 the Procurator Fiscal for Angus       
 District.  That such a large number of
 people involved in law enforcement are
 resident in the area has more to do   
 with the quiet attractiveness of the  
 area than with a need for heavy       
 policing!                             
                                       
     Notwithstanding, crime is on the  
 increase.  The increase in            
 housebreaking is attributed to the    
 increased mobility of theives from    
 outwith the area.  The enforcement of 
 laws concerning soft drugs (mainly    
 cannabis) consume a considerable      
 amount of police time.
