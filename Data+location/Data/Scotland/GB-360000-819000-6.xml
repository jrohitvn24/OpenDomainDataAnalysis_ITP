		<content> Pupils, who until about 1965 were     
 mainly from the farming and forestry  
 community, now come from a much       
 broader field. The oil industry has   
 spilled over as far west as Keig and  
 there have been numbers of "immigrant"
 children viz. Australian, American,   
 South American, Canadian, South       
 African, Dutch - even a Singalese at  
 one point - also English, Welsh and   
 Irish children.                       
 The school has visiting specialist    
 teachers in Art, Drama, Home          
 Economics, Music and Physical         
 Education. A remedial teacher comes   
 once weekly for pupils with "learning"
 difficulties and a speech therapist is
 available as required.                
 The present Headmistress has held the 
 post for 16 years and now teaches all 
 seven classes, ages from 4+ to 12     
 years.                                </content>
