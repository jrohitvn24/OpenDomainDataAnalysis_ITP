		<title>01S.W.ARBROATH AND DISTRICT.</title>
		<content> One corner of our area covers the     
 South-West quarter of the town of     
 Arbroath,including the industrial     
 estate.Arbroath is a coastal town     
 which now relies less upon the fishing
{industry}than it did in the past.     
 Arbroath is still a popular holiday   
 resort and many people still make a   
 living thanks to{tourism}.The rest of 
 the area consists mostly of good      
{farming}land, from the village of     
 Arbirlot in the North-West corner     
 down to the coast.The main Dundee     
 road and rail links provide good      
{communications}for commuters and      
 shoppers.Between the railway line     
 and the pebbled beach lies the West   
 Links where there are many organised  
 activities for tourists in the summer.
 There are many hotels and guest houses
 as well as two well equipped caravan  
 sites nearby.                         </content>
