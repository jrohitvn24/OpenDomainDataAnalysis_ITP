		<title>11A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LIAM</title>
		<content> I woke up at 8a.m. I had to struggle  
 out because that night I had watched  
 "The Wild Geese",a late film on TV.I  
 climbed down out of my cabin bed and  
 hit the light with my head. I got my  
 clothes on and went downstairs. Next I
 went into the kitchen to eat my       
 breakfast. I said 'bye to my mum at   
 8.30a.m. and went down the road to    
 school. I arrived at school at        
 8.35a.m. and waited for my friends to 
 come. We went into school at 9o'clock.
 We started with writing about the     
 prize-giving which was the day before.
 At 10.40a.m. we got out for playtime. 
  At playtime we usually play at       
 football but this is quite difficult  
 because there are only 5 boys and a   
 very sloped playground. If the ball   
 rolls away it lands in a stream at    
 the bottom of our path.
