 every Monday between 10.30 and 11.30  
 in the pool at{Craigroyston Community 
{School.}A few are swimming for the    
 first time ever. Some find that the   
 gentle exercise of swimming helps to  
 ease the aches and pains caused by    
 arthritis and makes them fitter and   
 healthier.                            
 A man appeared at the{High Court}in   
{Edinburgh}charged with drug offences. 
 He had heroin in a flat at{47/6       
{Muirhouse Park}and he intended to     
 supply it to others. He had 8 previous
 convictions. The judge said that the  
 courts have made it plain that        
 penalties for people trafficking in   
 drugs should now be severe. The man   
 was jailed for five years.            </content>
