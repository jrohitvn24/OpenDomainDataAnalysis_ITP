		<title>12RECREATION IN RHU.</title>
		<content> People in the Rhu area are fond of the
 outdoor life and make good use of the 
 facilities available.For many years,  
 Rhu has been noted for its water_based
 activities, in particular sailing,more
 recently windsurfing in the Bay and to
 a lesser extent,canoeing with groups  
 coming to the Blairvadach Outdoor     
 Centre to learn these skills.Keen     
 anglers come all year round to fish in
 the waters of the Gareloch.Land_based 
 activities tend to concentrate on the 
 fitness aspect with keep fit, dance   
 and aerobic classes being popular.    
 Facilities for Badminton and Squash   
 are available within the village but  
 tennis enthusiasts have to travel to  
 nearby Helensburgh for public courts. 
 With the increasing number of joggers 
 came the formation of a local running 
 club and for budding equestrians there
 is the Riding School at Shandon.      </content>
