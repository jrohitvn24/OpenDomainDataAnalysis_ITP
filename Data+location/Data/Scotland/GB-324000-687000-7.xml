		<title>07COAL  MINING, KIRKCALDY</title>
		<content> Seafield Colliery is situated on the  
 outskirts of Kirkcaldy.               
 Prior to the period of industrial     
 action by the miners in 1984-85,      
 Seafield produced approximately       
 17-18,000 tons of coal per week. The  
 current weekly output is around 10,000
 tons, partly due to the after affects 
 of the strike, and partly due to an   
 underground fire which did some       
 considerable damage to one of the main
 faces. It is hoped that production    
 will again be increased in the near   
 future.                               
 Of the coal produced, 20% is used for 
 household fuel, and the remainder is  
 used in local industry (namely in     
 Nairns floor coverings in Kirkcaldy,  
 and in the paper mills in Leslie.)    
 Coal is also shipped by rail and road 
 to Longannet Power Station near       
 Kincardine.                           </content>
