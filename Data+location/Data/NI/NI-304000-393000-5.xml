		<title>05Dairy Farm,      Randalstown</title>
		<content> There is a lot of money involved in a 
 modern  dairy farm,and Mr.McNeilly    
 keeps careful records and accounts of 
 all income and expenditure each year. 
  A lot of the money he makes is       
 channelled back into the farm in the  
 form of new machinery and buildings.  
 Recently three new sheds for use      
 as cubical houses have been built on  
 the farm. These are fully waterproof  
 and are built of a wooden structure   
 covered with corrugated iron. They    
 range in size from 1800sq.feet to     
 2400sq.feet and cost around{Â£12,000   
 each, although{40%}of this was given  
 as a government grant.                
 Other old outhouses are made of stone 
 and have whitewashed walls and red    
 doors.                                
 The farmhouuse has recently been      
 renovated, to make it a very modern   
 and comfortable home in which to live.</content>
