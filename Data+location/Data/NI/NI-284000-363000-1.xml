		<title>01GENERAL REVIEW: COALISLAND</title>
		<content> This D-Block lies off the South West  
 shores of LOUGH NEAGH. Is largely     
 RIVAl, CATHOLIC area with a PROTESTANT
 ghetto almost totally confined to the 
 1km square of BALLYNAKILLY and a large
 residitial and industrial estate  as  
 the area approachs the small town of  
 COALISLAND which serves the area as a 
 shopping , transport and entertainment
 centre. This is an area steeped in    
 TRADITION where FAMILY TIES and       
 FOLKLORE are very strong.The          
 predamiana of particular names eg     
 O'NEILL INDICATES THE trend when      
 marriage partners are chosen from the 
 immediate neighbourhood and the couple
 tend to set up home  locally.the      
 handing down of these tradition is not
 only casrried out by the family but   
 also intentionally by specific groups 
 as in RELIGION and POLITICS.          
 UNEMPLOYMENT is high.                 </content>
