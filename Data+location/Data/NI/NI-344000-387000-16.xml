		<title>16THE FARMER AND HIS CALF</title>
		<content>       The Farmer and his Calf         
                                       
     It was a wet morning and the rain 
 showered down like the spray from a   
 freak wave. Mr. Adamson's Landrover   
 came slithering down the muddy lane.  
     Mr. Adamson was like something    
 from "Robinson Crusoe" in his old     
 clothes.                              
     In the middle of the conversation 
 there was a clattering in the back of 
 the Landrover like a train over       
 points.                               
     Later the mystery of the noise was
 solved. I was shown a six hour old    
 calf, its black coat fluffed up and   
 wet, like a lion's mane.It's eyes     
 shone like black jewels glinting in   
 the sun. It slipped and skidded like a
 learner on an ice rink as its long    
 legs and cloven hoofs frantically     
 searched for grip.                    </content>
