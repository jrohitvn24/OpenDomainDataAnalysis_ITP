		<title>11TOURISM IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> Annalong is becoming more popular as a
 tourist area with the number of       
 tourist increasing every year.Most of 
 them come in July.April,June and      
 August are quite popular as well.     
 The increase in the number of tourists
 that come is probably due to the newly
 built Marina.People from cities would 
 come to get away from the pollution.  
 Others would come to see the mill     
 which is now in working order.        
 Mountaineers would come to climb the  
 mountains.Others would be attracted by
 the sea and come to fish or swim in   
 it.                                   
 The tourists come from Ireland and    
 oddly enough some come from places    
 abroad like America.Most people who   
 come are pensoiners who probably come 
 for a quiet rest. They usually stay   
 for a week or spend a weekend on      
 passing through.                      </content>
