 Our area is situated in the middle of 
 the northern part of{County Antrim.}It
 is all rural with no towns or         
 villages. In it there are{83 occupied 
{dwelling houses,}most of which are on 
 farms. Nearly all the houses are in   
 good condition. In May 1985,{204      
{adults}and{88 children}(of school age 
 or under) were living there.          
 The area is unusual in that it        
 contains 5 small lakes, 4 of which are
 situated in a large estate. This      
 estate, which is very beautiful is    
 known as Lissanoure and is owned by   
 the Mackie family.                    
 The highest point in the area is      
 Kendal's Hill (sometimes called Boyd's
 Top). It is{179M}above sea-level, and 
 from it, nearly all the area can be   
 seen.                                 </content>
