 miles from Ballygawley. There are no  
 shopping facilities. There are no     
 facilities for children to play in the
 Lisdoart area and the residents       
 suggest that the proper leisure and   
 shopping facilities should be         
 developed.                            
    In the Lisdoart area there is a row
 of terraced houses known as Lisdoart  
 terrace. There are seventeen houses   
 with sixtytwo people living there.    
 There are two bedrooms in each house. 
 There is also a large garden behind   
 each of the two-storey houses.        
    Lisdoart is mainly a farming area, 
 the main crops being grown are barley 
 and potatoes.
