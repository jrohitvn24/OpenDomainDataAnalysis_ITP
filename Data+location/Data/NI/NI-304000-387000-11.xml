		<content> THERE ARE TWO MAIN ROADS IN THE AREA  
 THE MAIN TOOME TO RANDALSTOWN ROAD IS 
 PART OF THE MAIN ROAD TO BELFAST AND  
 IS THE BEGINNING OF THE M2 MOTORWAY.  
 THERE IS A VERY GOOD BUS SERVICE IN   
 BOTH DIRECTIONS AND THIS ROAD IS USED 
 BY HEAVY LORRIES CARRYING GOODS TO AND
 FROM BELFAST.                         
                                       
 THE OTHER ROAD FROM TOOME TO          
 RANDALSTOWN SWINGS TOWARDS AND AWAY   
 FROM THE LOUGH AND THERE IS NO PUBLIC 
 TRANSPORT ON THIS ROAD SO PEOPLE      
 HAVE TO DEPEND ON PRIVATE CARS, WHILE 
 SCHOOL BUSES TAKE THE CHILDREN TO THE 
 VARIOUS SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THE AREA.
                                       
 FROM THIS ROAD A NETWORK OF SMALLER   
 ROADS RUN TO AND AROUND THE LOUGH     
 SHORE AND OUT TO THE MAIN TOOME       
 RANDALSTOWN ROAD.                     
                                       </content>
