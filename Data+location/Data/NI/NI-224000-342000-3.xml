		<title>03Enniskillen Farmers Mart.</title>
		<content>   The present day mart opened in      
 1946,on the site of the old Fairgreen,
 where farmers used to walk their      
 animals to the fair. The mart operates
 on Wednesday with sheep sales, and    
 cattle sales on Thursday. Animals were
 bought and sold by farmers from all   
 over Co. Fermanagh. Previously some   
 cattle from S. Ireland were sold but  
 no longer, because of government      
 policy. The total cattle sold today is
 lower than 10 years ago; many farmers 
 now rear and sell cattle direct to the
 factories.                            
   There is a seasonal variation. In   
 autumn it is very busy, with extra    
 sales for sucked calves. 200 dropped  
 calves are sold weekly,from dairy     
 herds.These are bought by dealers and 
 reared for beef in other areas of N.  
 Ireland. The mart has a very important
 role in Fermanagh livestock Farming.  </content>
