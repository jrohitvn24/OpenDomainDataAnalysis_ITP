		<content> The {farm }we visited was one typical 
 of the area.There are 9 acres of      
 land,2 acres of which are now showing 
 potatoes and the remainder is sown    
 with barley.In the large barn the     
 baled hay, straw and potatoes are     
 stored.The farming equipment includes 
 a tractor, a plough,a potato          
 harvestor,a potato drill and          
 sprayer.The most of the work such as  
 combine harvesting is done by a       
 contractor.{Potatoes}.In September the
 potatoes are ready for digging and are
 stored in straw.The brands used are   
 British Queens,Dunbarstandard and     
 Pentland dell.{Barley}.In September   
 the barley is ready for the           
 combine harvestor which cuts it and   
 knocks off the grain to be used for   
 animal feed-cattle,pigs,poultry etc.  
 The straw is baled up and used for    
 bedding down animals in winter.       </content>
