		<content>{FARMING} This intensively managed     
 grassland suits the rearing of beef   
 cattle and sheep.                     
{CATTLE}  The farmers graze mainly     
 Continental-type cattle (particularily
 Charolais,Simmental and Limousin) for 
 beef production.They are grazed       
 outdoors during the summer and are    
 housed indoors in large beef houses   
 during the winter. The main winter    
 fodder crops are hay and silage.The   
 finished cattle are either sold at the
 local market or sold direct to the    
 Meat Plants.                          
{SHEEP}    The hilly land is suited to 
 sheep.Most ewes have 2 lambs each     
 winter which are fattened for         
 slaughter.                            
{POULTRY}  A no. of farmers work       
 intensive broiler chicken units. These
 young birds are fattened for 7/8 weeks
