		<title>13Guiness Primary School:Then.</title>
		<content> Built in 1847,following a request for 
 aid on June 29th. of that year,the    
 school is a maintained one;ie.it is   
 owned by the parish but run and       
 maintained by the government.         
 Originally it consisted of only one   
 classroom of stone.In the early       
 twentieth century a second classroom  
 and a porch were added.               
 Attendances at the school have varied,
 but they peaked during the war years  
 (1939-1945) when the area was a haven 
 for evacuees from Belfast.Numbers in  
 the school then exceeded one hundred, 
 double the present enrolment.         
 Teaching methods in these early days  
 were mainly rote learing,and content  
 was based on the three R's;reading,   
 'riting,and 'rithmatic.
