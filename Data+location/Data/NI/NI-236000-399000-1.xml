		<content> Artigarvan stands on the bank of the  
 Glenmornan River, approximately three 
 miles north east of{Strabane}, in     
 Co. Tyrone.                           
 The main source of employment in      
 Artigarvan and the surrounding area is
 the{Leckpatrick Creamery Co-Operative,
 which processes the milk produced by  
 dairy farmers in the immediate area.  
 The river which flows through         
 Artigarvan was once one of the busiest
 rivers in Ulster, providing power for 
 four corn mills, a sawmill, a paper   
 mill and a spade factory.One of the   
 biggest water wheels in Ireland, 2O   
 feet in diameter, is to be seen here, 
 although it is not in use today.      
 This is an agricultural area with     
 fertile farmland.Most of the land is  
 grassland and is used for{Dairy       
{Farming.}
