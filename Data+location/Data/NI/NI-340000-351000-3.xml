 been used eversince.It is a very      
 important feature in the area.All the 
 walls are painted white.There are     
 twelve windows including those of the 
 toilets.The toilets are joined onto   
 the back of the school.The old toilets
 used to be at the top of our grounds. 
 A wall about a metre high surrounds   
 the playground.There is a dividing    
 wall at the back of the school but    
 none at the front.The windows are a   
 tall rectangular shape with nine panes
 in them.There is a kitchen and a cloak
 room at the front of the school.Both  
 classrooms in our school take up the  
 same area.There are a few windows in  
 the new toilets which were built three
 years ago.There are chimneys on the   
 roof because{fires}were used before   
 electric heating was installed.
