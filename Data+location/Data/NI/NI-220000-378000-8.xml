		<content> AUGHNAHOO                             
                                       
 AUGHNAHOO IS QUITE A BIG TOWNLAND.    
 THERE USED TO BE A SCHOOL IN THIS AREA
 AND IT WAS SITUATED NEAR THE GIANT    
 STONE.  PEOPLE SAY THAT A GIANT THREW 
 THIS STONE FROM THE TOP OF A HILL AND 
 LEFT HIS HANDPRINT ON IT.  THE SCHOOL 
 IS NOW MADE INTO A DWELLING HOUSE.    
 THERE IS AND OLD CAVE IN AUGHNAHOO    
 CALLED "SOUTERRAINE" BUT IT IS        
 PRACTICALLY CLOSED NOW.               
 THERE ARE ABOUT SIX FAMILIES IN THIS  
 DISTRICT AND YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN   
 OLD LANE WHICH PEOPLE TRAVELLED ON TO 
 GET TO THE VILLAGE.  BEFORE THIS LANE 
 THEY HAD TO CROSS A BURN USING        
 STEPPING STONES AS THEIR PATH.  THIS  
 LANE IS NOW CLOSED AND WILL PROBABLY  
 NEVER BE USED AGAIN.
