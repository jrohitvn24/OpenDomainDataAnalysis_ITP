 MUSHROOM FARMING IS VERY POPULAR IN   
 OUR PARISH.THERE ARE MAINLY SMALLER   
 MUSHROOM CONCERNS WITHIN OUR GRID     
 AREA. THESE FARMERS HAVE CONTRACTS    
 WITH LARGER MUSHROOM GROWERS AND      
 EXPORTERS WHO SUPPLY THE MARKETS HERE 
 AND ABROAD.                           
          MUSHROOM GROWING IS HAZARDOUS
 AS WELL AS DIFFICULT AND HEAVY WORK.NO
 TWO DAYS ARE THE SAME ON A MUSHROOM   
 FARM.THE COMPOST IS BROUGHT TO        
 A TEMPERATURE OF 140C IN THE PEAK     
 HEATING HOUSE.THE MUSHROOM SPAWN HAS  
 TO BE SPRINKLED ON AND MIXED WITH THE 
 COMPOST.THIS IS THEN LEFT IN IN A VERY
 WARM DARK ATMOSPHERE FOR ABOUT 14     
 DAYS, THEN THE MIXTURE OF PEAT AND    
 LIME ARE SPRINKLED ON TOP ---THIS     
 PROCESS IS KNOWN AS CASING            
     THEN THIS IS LEFT IN BOXES IN THE 
 CROPING HOUSE FOR A FURTHER THREE WEEK</content>
