		<title>08SHOWING CATTLE</title>
		<content>  Preparation for showing cattle starts
 about six months before the actual    
 show.                                 
  The farmer starts by building up the 
 pedigree bullocks on specialised      
 foodstuffs such as oats and hay       
 containing vitamins.                  
  Nearer the shoe date the bullocks are
 washed are groomed regularly so that  
 they look good and healthy.           
  Show time can be hectic as the farmer
 has to go to the venue regularly with 
 food for cattle.                      
  If the cattle are properly prepared  
 and successful at the show, the farmer
 benefits from a cash prize which can  
 help towards the cost of next year's  
 show.                                 
  More attractive though are the cups  
 and trophies which can be won. Show   
 time is a very important time in the  
 farmer's calendar.                    </content>
