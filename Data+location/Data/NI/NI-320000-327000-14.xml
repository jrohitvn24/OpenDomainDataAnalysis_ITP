		<content> There are many kinds of houses,some I 
 would like to live and some I would   
 not.Our house is a two bed _ roomed   
 semi_ detached bungalow type with     
 medium sized gardens at the front and 
 rear.Two of the houses in our park    
 have 3 bedrooms and sit in a little   
 plot of ground on their own.Nearby    
 there are other 3 bed_roomed houses   
 but these do not take up as much space
 because they have upstairs.In the     
 country there are some lovely         
 bungalows with very large gardens and 
 some large farm houses with concrete  
 yards and animal sheds.In some parts  
 of the country,but not very often you 
 might see some white_washed cottages
