		<content> In the country to survive you needed  
 to be a farmer.All the food people ate
 was from farms.Butter was made with a 
 churn_staff which was a round,        
 reasonably tall,item about the height 
 of a barrel.A boy of ten in 1915 who  
 collected the potatoes in the harvest 
 got ten pennies a day.There were 240p 
 in a pound.                           
 Today a person working on a farm could
 get up to Â£20 a day.There is a very   
 wide variety of food to choose from.  
 People often went at night to visit   
 their neighbouring houses.There were  
 ceilies and singing.Once every three  
 years a circus would visit the area.  
 If you were fairly well off you would 
 probably be able to buy a gramophone  
 which would be equivalent to the      
 record player today.
