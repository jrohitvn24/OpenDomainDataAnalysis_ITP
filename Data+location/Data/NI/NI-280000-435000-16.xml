		<title>16The Elderly in Portstewart</title>
		<content> Being a seaside town Portstewart      
 attracts a considerable number of     
 people of retirement age. Tullaghmurry
 Fold caters specifically for people in
 this category. F.O.L.D.,stands        
 for"Free the old from loneliness with 
 dignity." It is a non-profit making   
 organisation which was set up in      
 Dublin some years ago by the Church of
 Ireland to provide accomodation for   
 retired school-masters. Nowadays it is
 open to anyone of retirement age who  
 is able to look after him or her self.
 The Portstewart Fold was opened about 
 three years ago and has about 34      
 units,some of which are for single    
 people and some for married couples or
 brothers and sisters. There is a      
 supervisor constantly on hand in case 
 any of the residents need assistance. 
 The headquarters of the organisation  
 is now in Holywood,Co.Down.           </content>
