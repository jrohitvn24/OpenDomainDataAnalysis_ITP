		<title>14SUPERMARKET MUM</title>
		<content> My mummy works 3 days a week in       
 Stewart's supermarket.  She works from
 9am to 5.30pm.  She packs the shelves 
 where the cornflakes and other cereals
 are.  If someone is off sick and they 
 are short of a person to work         
 somewhere else, my mum would work     
 there.  That sort of thing usually    
 happens behind the meat counter or at 
 the check-outs. My mum says she does  
 not really like to work at the        
 check-outs because she said she is    
 always thinking she is going to make a
 mistake.  Occasionally she would have 
 to work on a Saturday but that doesn't
 happen very often. Sometimes if a tin 
 gets dented she can get it for half   
 price. On Monday nights about once a  
 month she would stock-take, when a    
 count is made of all the things on the
 shelves.
