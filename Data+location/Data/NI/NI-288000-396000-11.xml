		<content>  I was a{bridesmaid}on a June Wedding.
 My{friends}all came to see me at the  
 Church.Last October I was measured for
 my bridesmaid's{dress.}It takes a long
 time to arrange all the details for a 
{white wedding.}Stephen was a{pageboy, 
 Kathy and Samantha were{flowergirls.  
 There were two other{bridesmaids,}a   
{groomsman,}a{best man}and the{bride   
 and{groom.}The bride arrived last,    
{late,}with her{father}in a Rolls      
 Royce.  First there was the Marriage  
{Service.} Then we made a lovely       
{procession}as we walked down the aisle
 through our friends. There were lots  
 of{photographs}taken.  We drove to a  
{reception}in a hotel.There was a      
 lovely{meal,}some{speeches}and a      
 lot of{fun.} It was all over when the 
 bride and groom left on their         
{honeymoon}holiday to Majorica.
