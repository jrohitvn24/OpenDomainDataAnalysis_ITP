		<title>06        DAIRY FARMING 2</title>
		<content> There are a good few Dairy farmers in 
 the Gortin area. There are eleven     
 Dairy farmers who send milk to the    
 creamery.                             
     The farmers have got tanks in     
 their dairies to hold the milk.It is  
 then collected by bulk tanker and     
 taken to the creamery.                
     The milk is then taken to         
 Artigarvan creamery in a village      
 outside Strabane.                     
     It is then made into butter,cheese
 and yogurt. Most of the milk is       
 bottled and sold.                     
     In dairy farming there is a       
 quota for how much milk you send. If  
 you send milk over the quota you are  
 fined 13p per litre.                  
     The base price for milk is around 
 16.17p per litre. This price is       
 subject to deductions for             
 transport,hygiene and quailty.        </content>
