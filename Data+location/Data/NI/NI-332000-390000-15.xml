		<title>15STRAID PLANTATION</title>
		<content> One of the most noticable landmarks in
 Straid  is  the  plantation.  This  is
 situated  on  {high  ground }close  to
 Straid  Village.  It covers roughly{15
{acres }of  ground and has mostly{beech
{trees}growing on it.  As well as beech
 there  are  spruce, oak  and  sycamore
 trees  growing.   From  the top of the
 plantation  on a clear day you can see
 such  places  as  The Cave Hill, Lough
 Neagh,   Ballyeaston   and  Ballyboley
 Forest.    There   are {disused  mines
 running  through  the hill and some of
 the  disused  shafts are marked on the
 map.   Most  of the trees were planted
 over 100 years ago.  All over the hill
 there  are  badgers,  foxes,  weasles,
 hares and  rabbits  living.           
      At  Straidhill  House  Dr. Wilson
 lives,  her  brother  owns the village
 shop.
