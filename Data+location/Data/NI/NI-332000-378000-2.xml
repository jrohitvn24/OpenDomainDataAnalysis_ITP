		<content> M2 motorway comes onto the Shore RD.  
 Further up the Antrim RD there is     
 Bellevue zoo which is the only zoo in 
 the city of Befast:                   
 From the Shore RD to the Antrim RD    
 that is along Fortwilliam Park there  
 is a steep hill thats because you are 
 coming from sea level to the Cave     
 Hill.                                 
 From the Antrim RD you can see across 
 Belfast Lough to Hollywood in Co Down 
 and part of the shipyard,also across  
 Belfast Lough there is the two big    
 Harland and Wolff cranes. The area is 
 served by good public transport.      
 Traffic on the Antrim and Shore roads 
 is extremly heavy as they are two very
 major roads.                          
 The general area is well supplied with
 a variety of mature trees.            
 Hardly any big houses are without     
 trees.                                </content>
