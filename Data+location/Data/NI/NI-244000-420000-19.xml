		<title>19HOUSING IN THE CULMORE AREA</title>
		<content>    Before studying in detail the      
 housing in the Culmore area our group 
 took into consideration the different 
 types of housing and the different    
 aspects of each house that we should  
 be looking out for.We took a look at  
 various types of housing such as;     
 bungalows,two-storeys,three-storeys,  
 semi-detached,detached,mansions and   
 even caravans.The main housing areas  
 in our square are Ballynagard Housing 
 Estate on the west bank,and           
 Strathfoyle Housing Estate on the east
 bank of the river.Other housing       
 estates consist of various and bigger 
 types.There are areas of urban renewal
 on the west bank of the area where a  
 new housing estate is being built.To  
 preserve the countryside the council  
 have establisheda Green Belt Law in   
 which no buildings are permitted to be
 built.                                </content>
