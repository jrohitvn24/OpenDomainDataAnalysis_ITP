		<content> Ray Davey's name is familiar in Ulster
 and to thousands outside the island,  
 because of the work he has done to    
 bring divided Ulster people together. 
 His early life was in Dunmurry, where 
 his father was the Presbyterian       
 minister for many years. He wrote     
 about life in Dunmurry in the twenties
 in a book. During the war he was a    
 prisoner in Italy and Germany, and    
 after this he became Presbyterian     
 chaplain to the Queen's               
 University.Here he formed a truly     
 ecumenical group and was loved by all.
 His greatest work was in the formation
 of the Corrymeela community which     
 brings together all kinds of people,  
 transcending any sect or religion. The
 community has dissolved much hatred   
 and affected thousands here and       
 abroad.                               
                                       </content>
