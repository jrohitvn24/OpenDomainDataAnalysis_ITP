		<title>09TOUR OF FLORENCECOURT HOUSE</title>
		<content>{Library:The library}is a tall         
 narrow room.The shelves are made of   
{pinewood}and hold over 1 thousand     
 books.It takes 2 weeks to clean one   
 section of books.The fireplace was    
 installed in 1925.After the fire      
 in 1955 it was thought that the roof  
 might collapse so it was suspended    
 from the floor above.The Italian      
 waxings on the table behind the settee
 are of the 3rd Earl and his brother,  
 Colonel Henry Aurthur Cole.           
{Drawing room:}The ceiling has been    
 replaced though the frieze is the     
 original,showing sorrow and joy.The   
 portraits are loaned by{Lord Rossmore.
 The chimneypiece was brought here in  
 1946. Photoghaphs show the 5th Earl in
 his younger days and the present Lady 
 Enniskillen.The writing desk was made 
 in Dublin and dated around 1750,the   
 time the House was built.             </content>
