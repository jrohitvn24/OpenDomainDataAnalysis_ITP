		<content> This fodder may be hay or silage but  
 farms at this altitude are mainly     
 pasture. Since the 1985 Summer was so 
 wet and cool, many farmers who would  
 have enough hay, are having to buy it.
 Each farmer usually works his sheep   
 with a dog - often a Border Collie.   
 Virtually none of these upland farms  
 have any dairy cattle. A few might    
 keep a couple of pigs. There has been 
 an increase in the number of goats    
 kept for their milk - perhaps a       
 response to the increasing diagnosis  
 of allergy to cows milk. Many farmers 
 wives keep hens; a few fatten geese   
 and ducks for sale at Christmas.      
 Most farmhouses, whether attached     
 to working farms or not, have been    
 modernised, often by adding a second  
 storey and/or a kitchen extension.    
 Some have only been connected to the  
 telephone system in the last 5 years. </content>
