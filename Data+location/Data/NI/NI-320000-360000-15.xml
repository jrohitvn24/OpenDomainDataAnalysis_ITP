 Lisburn Borough Council have organised
 a 13 mile half marathon and a 6 mile  
 fun run in the month of June.The route
 takes the runners along the Moira     
 Road,into the Halftown and Blaris     
 Roads before heading back to Lisburn  
 for the finish.                       
 Over 3,000 competitors took part this 
 year-1,153 in the half marathon and a 
 staggering 2086 in the fun run.The    
 mayor of Lisburn,Councillor Walter    
 Lilburn,started the twin events from  
 Lisburn Recreation Centre at 6.30 p.m.
