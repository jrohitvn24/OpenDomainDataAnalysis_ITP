		<content> Other jobs in my grandfather's time   
 include{scutching}at the{flax mill}in 
 Meenagh which is in the north-east    
 corner of our block. It is now        
 disused, the water wheel no longer    
 turns but the {National Trust}have a  
{preservation order}on it so it always 
 will be there to remind us of the     
 times when{flax}was grown on almost   
 every farm in this area and used for  
 making {linen}. Today there is a      
 revival of interest in growing flax   
 because of the increasing use of linen
 in today's fashions.                  
      Grandfather had little time for  
 hobbies or pastimes, all the work     
 either at home or on the road was done
 by hand. This left him with little    
 time for play but when he did it was  
 not with electronic games or          
 mechanical toys as I do.
