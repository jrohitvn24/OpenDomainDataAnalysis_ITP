		<title>13CHANGES IN BELLEEK</title>
		<content> BELLEEK HAS CHANGED IN SO MANY        
 DIFFERENT WAYS.LONG AGO BELLEEK HAD   
 ONLY 2 CARS NOW IT HAS HUNDREDS       
 PACKED UP THE STREET.THE ONLY CARS    
 IN THE TOWN BELONGED TO THE DOCTOR AND
 MR.ELLIOT.NOW THE CARS HAVE DIFFICULTY
 IN PARKING BECAUSE THE COUNCIL HAVE   
 HAD A PLAN TO PLANT TREES.THERE WAS A 
 LOT OF ARGUMENTS BUT THE COUNCIL GOT  
 THERE OWN WAY IN THE END.ON A SATURDAY
 THE TOWN IS LIKE A BUSY CITY.THE      
 CATTLE MART IS SOMETIMES RESPONSIBLE  
 FOR THIS.PEOPLE BLOCK THE STREET WITH 
 THEIR CARS,GOING FROM ONE SHOP TO     
 ANOTHER OR TO THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE 
 STALLS.ABOUT 14 SHOPS AND SEVERAL     
 BANKS HAVE OPENED UP HERE WITHIN THE  
 LAST 5/6 YEARS. THREE HOUSING ESTATES 
 HAVE BEEN BUILT IN THE PAST 16 YEARS  
 AS PEOPLE MOVE FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE   
 INTO THE VILLAGE.WE HAVE ALSO A NEW   
 HEALTH CENTRE AND FIRE STATION        </content>
