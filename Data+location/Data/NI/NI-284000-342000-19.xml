		<content> This topic is about the {CALLAN VALLEY
{MILL }in Milford.In it contains an    
 interview with a former employee,{Mr. 
{Bennett} of Main Street Milford.      
 Callan_Valley_Mill has a sister       
 factory in{Glenanne}.This factory     
 prepared the linen,Callan mill then   
 wove and dyed the linen,then returned 
 it to Glenanne where it was packed.   
 However  this arrangement was later   
 changed.The Callan Valley Mill is     
 called this because it's power is     
 produced by the{Callan River.}The     
 original owner was{Mr. John Compton}  
 but since then there have been many   
 owners eg;{Mr Mc Crum}who was         
 responsible for the penalty kick in   
 football he also was involved in the  
 building of the Callan Valley         
 Institute which was for the benefit of
 the employees.There where about 200   
 employees in the mill at this time.   </content>
