		<content> Our area is partly urban and partly   
 rural in character. Much of the       
 countryside is devoted to farming but 
 a great deal of the land has been used
 for private and public housing. To    
 take a "birds eye view" of the area   
 would show farms and grassland, a few 
 rolling hills, a good network of roads
 and the river Braid meandering among  
 the green fields. The housing areas   
 are well served by schools, both at   
 primary and secondary level. Many of  
 the residents have found employment in
 the local industrial estate which     
 houses many service industries        
 e.g.Electricity supplies;bakery       
 supplies;dairy supplies. Shops and    
 super markets are conveniently placed 
 throughout the area. The main line    
 railway track runs to the city of     
 Belfast.
