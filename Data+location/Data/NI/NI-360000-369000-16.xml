		<title>16Homelife in Ballywalter</title>
		<content>    Many of the people in Ballywalter  
 were born here and so were their      
 relations. The women mainly work in   
 the textile factory, as home helps or 
 in shops.                             
    Farmers' wives often help their    
 husbands by feeding calves, pigs or   
 hens and cleaning dairy equipment.    
    Many teenagers have no jobs so     
 television is important and is for    
 them to enjoy and be entertained by.  
 It keeps them from hanging around the 
 streets and pubs.                     
    Many people also have videos so    
 they can hire films and then watch    
 them if they have nothing to do.      
    There are not so many stray dogs   
 going around now because the council  
 has dog-wardens going around lifting  
 them in a white van.The licence is so 
 dear that people cannot afford to keep
 them.                                 </content>
