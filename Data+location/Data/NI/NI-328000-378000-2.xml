 Educational provision in the block is 
 nil ( our own school lies just outside
 the boundary lines ). There are only  
 two schools within 0.5 km. of the     
 boundary lines. One of these is a     
 primary school and the other an 11-18 
 secondary school ( OURS! ). It is easy
 to appreciate from this, therefore    
 that children in the area have a      
 considerable distance to travel to    
 school each day. Since the bus service
 through the area is poor, many of the 
 children make their way to school by  
 car or by foot.
