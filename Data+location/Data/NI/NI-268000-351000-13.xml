		<content>  {Canoeing}has become a popular sport 
 in this area.  The main locations     
 used are{Carnteel Lough and White     
{Lough.                                
   Aughnacloy Secondary School and     
 their Youth Club have arranged        
 training sessions for those interested
 in this sport.  Canoeing is exciting  
 and sometimes frightening.  The       
 exciting aspect is going out in a life
 jacket and wet-suit for the first time
 and learning to balance the craft.    
   The next stage is learning how to   
 perform different manoeuvres. One that
 I learnt was how to make a raft. We   
 had to dock all the canoes together   
 and the two people at the out-side of 
 the raft had to move and steer it.    
 This was the frightening bit, because 
 it is very  easy to capsize the       
 canoes.                               
{  All in all, canoeing is good fun!   </content>
