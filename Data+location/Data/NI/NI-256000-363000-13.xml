		<title>13ALTAMUSKIN POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> Altamuskin P.O. is a sub-office of    
 Sixmilecross, and is an important     
 amenity in an area that has no other  
 business. The present Post Mistress,  
 'Mary Ann', as she is popularly called
 says she has been running the Office, 
 a room in her home, since early 1939  
 when she took over from her Mother-in-
 law. It has been on that site for over
 100 years. She remembers the Phone    
 Kiosk being erected in August 1939.   
 She recalls that a few days later when
 the phone first rang, the old lady    
 jumped on her bicycle and rode to the 
 'corn field' where the others were,   
 for one of them to come and answer the
 phone. The Office has never been busy 
 as it is at the present day. In the   
 good old days you could close the     
 door on certain days, and go out to   
 the fields or go into the village. She
 loves meeting her customers weekly.   </content>
