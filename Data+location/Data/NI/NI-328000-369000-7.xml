		<content> As our square is mainly residential   
 with a high population we decided to  
 study the housing in the area. Until  
 the early 1960s most of our area would
 have been a farming area. Our parents 
 and a teacher remember playing in the 
 fields where Trench Park,Dalebrook and
 Ladybrook now stand. The Oldest house 
 is situated on Finaghy Road and was   
 built in 1931. It is directly opposite
 the newest development, Appleton Park 
 where 79 units will be completed in   
 1986. The types of housing in this    
 area include flats, terraced,         
 semi-detached and detached. The       
 housing is generally in estates which 
 are serviced by local shops. As the   
 only major industry in the area is the
 Ford Motor Company most people travel 
 out of the area for work.
