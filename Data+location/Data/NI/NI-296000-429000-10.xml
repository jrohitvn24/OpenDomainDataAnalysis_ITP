		<title>10McARTHUR MARATHON, DERVOCK.</title>
		<content> The{McArthur Memorial Marathon}was    
 run in Dervock on 14th July 1984, in  
 memory of{K.K.Mc Arthur,}who was born 
 in Dervock, and won the Gold Medal in 
 the Olympic Marathon at Stockholm, on 
 14th July 1912. To allow more people  
 to take part, there was also a five   
 mile fun run and a half-marathon.     
 There were over 300 entries in the 3  
 events. 2 members of the{McArthur     
{Marathon Klub, Potchefstroom, South   
{Africa,}(where McArthur had emigrated 
 in 1905), ran in the main event. There
 were a couple of showers before the   
 start_dry and cool during the race_   
 but with a stiff breeze. The largest  
 crowds seen in the village, since     
{McArthur}returned with his gold medal,
 thronged the streets.{Billy Gallagher 
 won in a time of 2 hr 27 min 40 sec.  
 It is hoped to make this an annual    
 event, on the 2nd Saturday of July.   </content>
