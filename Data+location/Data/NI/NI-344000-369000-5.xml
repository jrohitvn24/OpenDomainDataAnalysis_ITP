		<title>05Farming - Garden Centre</title>
		<content>  Gillespie's Garden Centre covers 70  
 acres of ground.It consists of plants,
 trees and shrubs which are grown      
 there.Gillespie sells peat,fertilisers
 pesticides and gardening equipment.The
 garden centre has 7 large greenhouses,
 full of plants.Gillespie employs 7    
 full-time workers  who work all year  
 round.Gillespie's customers come from 
 all round Ulster,mostly gardeners but 
 not farmers.Also Gillespie is employed
 to carry out landscape gardening and  
 maintaining tubs around public        
 buildings.In the wintertime they are  
 slack in the trade but not in work.I  
 thought the centre was successful and 
 I think the man was right to say that 
 they were going to extend it.The bit I
 liked best was the long path;on one   
 side it was an ordinary hedge and on  
 the other it was a lovely landscaped  
 garden to show the use of plants.     </content>
