		<title>03SIX FARMS NEAR LIMAVADY II</title>
		<content> SELLING THE PRODUCE                   
 The{wheat barley}and{peas}are sold to 
 local millers for processing into     
 cattle food.  The{ware potatoes}are   
 bought by local merchants but the seed
 potatoes are{exported to Egypt}and the
{Canary Islands. }The oil seed rape is 
 sent to Liverpool to be made into     
 vegetable oil and the{flax}goes to    
{Belgium.                              
 PROBLEMS AND CHANGES ON THE FARMS     
 The main problems are the risk of{bad 
{weather,}the great{cost}of running the
 farm and unpredictable{prices. }The   
 farmers we talked to are always       
 looking for ways to improve their     
 farms.  Fields have been made larger  
 and two new crops, oil seed rape and  
 peas, have been introduced as they    
 fetch a good price.  One farmer is    
 experimenting with flax which hasn't  
 been grown in N Ireland for 40 years. </content>
