		<title>11THE JERSEY FARM</title>
		<content> can survive at great extremes of      
 climate.Secondly,they produce very    
 high quality milk with up to 7% or 8% 
 fat content.This means they are ideal 
 for dairy products like cream.        
  On the farm the cattle are housed in 
 loose housing over the winter and fed 
 silage and barley. Milking will soon  
 be by a pipeline system to the tank.  
 It is done twice a day,around 7.00am  
 and 4.00pm.At present it takes 1\ hrs 
 to milk all the cows.This should      
 decrease to about an hour when the    
 pipeline is finished.                 
  Mr.Lindsay has no plans for future   
 increases in his herd,and would like  
 to think that it would remain much the
 same in the years to come.
