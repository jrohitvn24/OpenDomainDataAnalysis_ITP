 --------                              
                                       
 Coleraine has great interest in       
 football, and the local Coleraine team
 plays at the show grounds on the      
 Ballycastle Road.  This team has been 
 very successful this year being       
 runners up in the Northern Ireland    
 league.  The team is preparing to     
 compete in Europe next year.          
   There are large playing fields      
  belonging to the Coleraine Academical
 Institution on the west bank of the   
 river.  There are rugby pitches and   
 tennis courts.                        
   They have a boat house, and jetties 
 from which the boys do rowing on the  
 River Bann.                           
   The Marina on the River Bann        
 provides facilities for water skiing. 
   Fishing is a very popular pastime.  </content>
