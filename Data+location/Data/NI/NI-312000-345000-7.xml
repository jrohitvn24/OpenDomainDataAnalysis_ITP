		<content>    There are no professional authors  
 in the Banbridge area but a number of 
 local historians and antiquarians have
 contributed works of interest to the  
 community.A wider readership has been 
 gained by the late Dr.W.Crowe, a past 
 headmaster of B.Academy,through his   
 acclaimed publications chronicling    
 life in the town &amp; district.A local   
 newspaper is published weekly by the  
 Banbridge Chronicle Office which also 
 prints other minor articles such as   
 school magazines.A wide range of      
 regional and national publications    
 circulate in the locality.British and 
 Irish television &amp; radio broadcasts   
 can be received throughout the entire 
 area.Recently the increasing          
 availability of the video recorder has
 extended the range of media pre-      
 paration of home-based entertainment.
