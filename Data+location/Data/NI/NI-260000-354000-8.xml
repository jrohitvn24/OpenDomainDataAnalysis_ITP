		<content> Booths is a factory which is situated 
 in the townland of Ballynany. This    
 factory sells dried calf, cow and     
 horse nuts. At the minute Booths      
 employs fourteen people but this      
 number always increases in the        
 wintertime because a larger number of 
 people are needed to look after the   
 cows in the shed. Inside the factory  
 are conveyor belts which bring the    
 bags of meal out from the interior of 
 the factory and drops them on a lorry.
    Booths was established in 1906 and 
 the industry is still thriving today, 
 attracting customers from as far away 
 as Enniskillen.                       
    Cootes is an engineering works in  
 the Lisdoart area. It is not an       
 industry on a large scale but only    
 employs three or four people.
