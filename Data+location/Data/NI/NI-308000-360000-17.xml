   Confirmation brings us closer to    
 God. It means that we no longer look  
 after just ourselves but we look after
 others as well. On confirmation day we
 are made strong and the holy Spirit   
 will always be with us.               
   I was chosen to sing the psalm.     
 There were two readers and seven      
 prayers of the faithful. The choir was
 made up of boys and girls from the    
 schools.                              
   Confirmation day was very exciting. 
 The bishop came to see us. It was a   
 beautiful ceremony and it was nice to 
 shake hands with the bishop. When     
 I went home there was a surprise party
 waiting for me. All my family were    
 there including my brother's          
 girlfriend. It was nice to see so many
 people coming to see me.
