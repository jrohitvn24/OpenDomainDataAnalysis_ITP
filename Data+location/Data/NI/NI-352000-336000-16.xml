		<content> THE LEVEL OF CANCER DEATH IS MUCH     
 HIGHER HERE THAN IN OTHER RURAL AREAS 
 IN N.IRELAND.IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE   
 IRISH SEA HAS BEEN POLLUTATED BY      
 NUCLEAR WASTE FROM SELLAFIELD.IT IS   
 THOUGHT THAT BATHING IN THIS AREA CAN 
 RESULT IN CANCER.THERE WAS AN INCIDENT
 WHEN SOME GIRLS BATHED TOGETHER IN THE
 IRISH SEA.LATER MOST OF THEM HAD      
 DEFORMED BABIES.MANY FISH CAUGHT IN   
 THE IRISH SEA ARE DISTORTED.THIS      
 DISTORTION IS NOT APPARENT IN OTHER   
 FISHING AREAS.A DELEGATION OF LOCAL   
 COUNCILLORS RECENTLY VISITED THE      
 SELLAFIELD NUCLEAR PLANT.A GOVERNMENT 
 INQUIRY RESULTED AND AN INVESTIGATION 
 AND A DETAILED ARE BEING CARRIED OUT. 
 THIS WILL HOPEFULLY SHOW THE NUMBER OF
 DEATHS CAUSED BY CANCER AND IT IS     
 HOPED THAT THE TESTS WILL SHOW THE    
 CAUSE OF CANCER.
