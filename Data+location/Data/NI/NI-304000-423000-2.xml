		<title>02DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content> Around our school the majority of     
 farms are dairy farms. These are farms
 which produce{milk.}                  
 The cows are milked twice a day- once 
 in the morning and again in the       
 evening.                              
 The most popular breed of cow in      
 our area is the{Friesian}which is     
 black and white. It gives lots of milk
 which is why it is popular. In winter,
 the cows stay indoors and are fed on  
{silage,}but, in Spring and Summer,    
 they go out into the fields to graze. 
 Nearly all the farmers do their       
{milking}by machines which are run by  
 electricity. When there is a power cut
 they have to milk by hand which is    
 very slow.                            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
