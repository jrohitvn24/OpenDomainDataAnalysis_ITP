		<content> The granite quarry (318288) on the    
 North side of Slieve Bearnagh has been
 an increasing scar on the landscape.  
 Recent planning permission has        
 insisted that only already-cut blocks 
 be removed: no further blasting is    
 allowed.                              
 Local farmers take a little sand and  
 gravel from a small pit in the glacial
 till at 3132999, mainly for repairing 
 farm tracks.                          
 Fofanny reservoir is part of the water
 supply system. It has an earth dam and
 the level of water fluctuates widely  
 in response to rainfall as it has a   
 fairly small catchment area and is a  
 shallow reservoir. Water from this    
 reservoir feeds via the Muddock River 
 into Lough Island Reavy, thence to    
 Portadown and Banbridge. Fofanny      
 reservoir supplies about 1.7 million  
 gallons per day into the system.      </content>
