 Ours is a rural area with small farms 
 scattered about the hillsides.        
 Approximately 70% are under 50 acres  
 in size, with the rest being less than
 100 acres.The cost to run a farm is   
 varied. 38% cost below Â£5000, 25% cost
 between Â£5000 and Â£10000 and the rest 
 cost over Â£10000 to maintain.         
 There are a variety of farms. Half of 
 them are mixed farms, 20% are dairy,  
 20% are beef and the remaining 10% are
 arable.                               
 We found the farms had 50% cows, 22%  
 pigs, 22% sheep and 6% other animals  
 such as ducks, hens and geese.        
 We found that the most common crop was
 grass at 33% while none of the farmers
 grew corn. 29% grew potatoes and 13%  
 grew other crops such as turnips,     
 silage and hay.
