		<title>11THE NEW PIER</title>
		<content>{IN JUNE 1984, THE PIER}FOR THE TIME   
 BEING WAS COMPLETED.THE TOTAL         
 EXPENDITURE FOR THIS NEW PIER WAS Â£1.8
 MILLION POUNDS .OF THIS TOTAL 9.5% TO 
 10% WAS PAID AN E.E.C GRANT ,66.6% WAS
 PAID BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE        
 REMAINING % PAID BY THE RATE_PAYERS.  
  THE COUNCIL THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO  
 HAVE ANEW PIER AS IT WOULD BE         
 BENEFICAL TO BALLYCASTLE'S FISHING    
 INDUSTRYAND ALSO,LARGER TRAWLERS WOULD
 BE ATTRACTED.                         
  THE COUNCIL ARE WAITING FOR THE      
 GOVERNMENT TO SEND THEM MONEY,SO AS   
 THE PIER CAN BE EXTENDED.HOWEVER ,IT  
 WILL COST A LOT OF MONEY,THEY FEAR    
 THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY THE  
 SUM OF MONEY REQUIRED.THEREFORE THERE 
 CHANCES OF AN EXTENSION IN THE FUTURE 
 IS SLIM.
