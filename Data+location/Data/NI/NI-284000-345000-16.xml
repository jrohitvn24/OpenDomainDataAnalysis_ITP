		<title>16ROAD BOWLS</title>
		<content>{Road Bowls or "Bullets"}is a game     
 played with a 28 oz iron bowl over an 
 approximate three mile stretch of     
 country road: the winner is the player
 to cover the distance in the least    
 number of shots or throws.  There is  
 no written evidence as to how or when 
 "Bullets" first came to Ireland.  One 
 theory is that the sport came with the
{Dutch soldiers}when{William of Orange 
 came to Ireland in 1689 while another 
 is that the sport was brought to      
 Ireland from{Yorkshire by linen       
{workers. }The Sport seem to have been 
 quite widespread in the eighteenth and
 nineteenth century, but today Road    
 Bowls are mainly confined to{Armagh   
{and Cork.}The contest or "score"      
 between the players often carries a   
 substantial side stake and each year  
 the champions of Cork and Armagh meet 
 to decide the{All-Ireland Champion.   </content>
