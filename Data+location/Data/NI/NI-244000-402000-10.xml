		<title>10HEALTH FARM</title>
		<content> The Health farm opened three years    
 ago in 1982 ,Mrs Clare Danton opened  
 it.The health farm caters for both    
 men and women.The age group which uses
 it most is 30-39  and 40-49.Those who 
 attend the health farm, attend to try 
 and lose weight, some do and some     
 people don't.The course lasts for 6   
 weeks. The Slendertone is a machine   
 which tightens up the muscle.The      
 treatment costs Â£20 for the six weeks 
  that you attend.The high fibre diet  
 is very important. Mrs.Danton opens   
 four days per week, the four days are 
 Mon,Tues,Wed,Thur, from 10.00am to    
 8.30pm.When we went to see Mrs.Clare  
 Danton she was taking a class of seven
 women.  She gave me a sample diet     
 sheet to study it was very            
 interesting.I do not think the diet   
 would suit me because you are not     
 allowed sweets.                       </content>
