		<content> This are is situated in the southern  
 edge of the{Antrim Plateau}and varies 
 in height from 40-70m.Its surface was 
 worn down during the{Ice Age}to form a
 gently undulating surface with small  
 hills covered in thick deposits of    
 boulder clay.                         
 About 90% of the land area is used for
 agriculture thus{buildings}are largely
 farmhouses with associated barns and  
 sheds.Most farms are small and are    
 scattered across the area.            
{Rural housing}has developed of late as
 town workers build bungalows to reside
 in the countryside.                   
{Housing estates}occupy about 10% of   
 the land area in the S.W.corner of the
 area.The houses are well arranged in  
 rows with open space and local        
 facilities provided.
