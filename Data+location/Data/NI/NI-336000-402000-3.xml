		<content> About{2000-2500 BC}the{Larne}area was 
 settled by Neolithic farmers who made 
 a stone circle  being excavated  near 
 my home in the Killyglen Road.  These 
{Neolithic}workers first dug a broad   
 ditch which they  partially filled in 
 before placing the stones on top. One 
 large oblong stone had once stood  at 
 the North West end.The{Archaeologists 
 found {porcellanite,}a hard rock only 
 mined at{Tievbulliagh }on the  Antrim 
 Plateau.They unearthed three pots,one 
 of which was burnished (polished with 
 a stone)   They also found a quantity 
 of flints and some charred bones.     
 The archaeologists  believe this area 
 was used as a meeting place. They had 
 to work quickly on this{ recovery dig 
 as a house is being built on the site.
