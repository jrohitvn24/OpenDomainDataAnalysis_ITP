		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content> Farmers in the rural district around  
 Magherafelt mostly have mixed farms   
 where they grow crops,including       
 vegetables and rear animals.They keep 
 dairy cows for milk so that they can  
 sell the milk to the Milk Marketing   
 Board. Farmers also keep calves and   
 bullocks for beef.Sheep are kept for  
 grazing and the farmer keeps the lambs
 that the ewes have had for about six  
 months before selling them for meat.  
 The farmers sell the sheep for mutton 
 when they are too old to be of any    
 further use.Pigs are kept for bacon   
 and pork and hens for their eggs.Many 
 farmers also grow potatoes which are  
 sold in the local area.Barley and     
 grass (hay and silage) are grown by   
 most of them as fodder for the cattle 
 in winter.
