		<title>06SUNDAY AT BUSHMILLS</title>
		<content>    On a{Sunday}we get up very early to
 go to{Sunday School}where we learn    
 stories about Jesus.  After Sunday    
 School we go to{church}where we sing  
 songs and every Sunday the minister   
 reads the Bible and speaks to us.     
    At half past twelve we leave church
 and go home and have our dinner.  We  
 nearly always have the same dinner    
 every Sunday.  At half past one we    
 have every thing tidied up.  Then we  
 go for the papers to the paper shop up
 the street.                           
    When we get home we go for a walk  
 to Portballintrae where we get        
 icecream.                             
    When we get home it is about five  
 o'clock so we have our tea which is a 
 salad.  Afterwards we watch television
 until we go to bed at ten o'clock.    
                                       
                                       </content>
