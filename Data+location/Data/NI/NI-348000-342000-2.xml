		<title>02  The Origins of Downpatrick</title>
		<content> Few towns in Ireland can lay claim to 
 such an impressive history as         
 Downpatrick.                          
   Ptolemy,in his list of the towns of 
 Ireland about the year A.D.130        
 includes it as "Dunum".               
   About the beginning of the Christian
 era the district was ruled by         
 "Celtair",who gave his name to the    
 area.Rath-Celtair-Mhic Duach or Dun   
 Celtair (the fort of Celtar) was its  
 earliest name.                        
   "Rath Celtair" was superseded by its
 ecclesiastical name: Dun-leth-glas    
 (the fortress of the twin green       
 slopes).                              
   This name gave place to the shorter 
 form of Dun or Down,and from the 13th 
 century from its connection with the  
 patron saint of Ireland __ Patrick __ 
 hence Downpatrick.
