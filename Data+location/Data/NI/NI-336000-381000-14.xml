		<title>14BOAT CLUB</title>
		<content> GP14 Sailing dinghies.  There are also
 some large cruising yachts ranging    
 from 17 - 40 feet in length.          
                                       
 Many members take part in local,      
 national and international            
 competitions.  In the Irish Helmsman  
 Championships last year, two of the   
 members came 7th and 11th.  The club  
 also holds a yearly regatta to which  
 other boat clubs are invited.  This   
 year it is being held on 22nd June to 
 coincide with the raft-race which is  
 taking place at the Loughshore Park.  
                                       
 The present commodore of the club is  
 Mr Burnett.
