    The {Doagh  River }flows  North  to
 South in the area  and  on  the  three
 kilometres which we  have there are at
 least six old mills.                  
                                       
    Some of these  mills e.g.Cogry Mill
 and Doagh Spinning  Mill are mentioned
 in other pages while Springvale Bleach
 works is described  in the project for
 the adjoining rectangle.

 at various  points down the river were
 all concerned with{flax}..scutching,  
 beetling, spinning and were located   
 there to use the power of the river.
