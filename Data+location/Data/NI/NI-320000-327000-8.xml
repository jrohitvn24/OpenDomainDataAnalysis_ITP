		<content> The people of Hilltown are lucky to be
 able to rent a plot of land on a bog  
 and cut their own turf.This plot of   
 land would be called a{BANK}and it    
 would cost at least Â£10 for a         
 year.Turf is moss squeezed up into one
 big lump.The way you would cut turf is
 by cutting the top sod off and making 
 a spread to throw the turf on.The     
 cutter would either cut and{FORLIC}or 
 cut and{BARROW}and he would let it    
 dry.In a few days if the weather was  
 good he would go up again and turn it 
 to the other side.After the cutter had
 done this he would start{FOOTING}the  
 turf.He would stand the turf in fours 
 with clods on top and then a few days 
 after the cutter would turn it        
 again.When the turf was dried         
 throughly he would take it home.
