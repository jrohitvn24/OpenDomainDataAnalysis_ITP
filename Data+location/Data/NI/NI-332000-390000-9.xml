		<title>09SHEEP FARMING</title>
		<content> My  name  is David Caldwell.  I help a
 farmer called Dennis Boyd.  He has{145
{sheep, }40 Black Faced ewes, 5 Cheviot
 ewes,  50  Crossbred ewes and the rest
 are  Border Leicester.  He  has  eight
 rams one is a Hampshire Down, four are
 Border   Leicester   and   three   are
 Suffolk.   One  Suffolk  ram  and  the
 Border  Leicester  are  for fattening.
 When  lambs are about 3 or 4 weeks old
 their{tails are cut,}if they are young
 rams they are ringed.  They are{dipped
 once  a  year to kill fleas.  They are
{sheared }once  a year as well.  Dennis
 takes  his  wool  to   Muckamore.   He
 shears sheep for people, first he sets
 up  the pen and puts the sheep into it
 then  he  grabs a ewe or ram and holds
 it  between  his  legs  and shears it.
 Samuel  and  I  roll  up the wool.  In
 September  the rams start to mate.  In
 February the ewes lamb.               </content>
