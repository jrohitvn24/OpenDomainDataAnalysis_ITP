		<title>11HISTORY - BALLYUTOAG SCHOOL</title>
		<content> In 1874 a National school was built in
 the area. It was named Ballyutoag     
 National School. It was built by the  
 local landlord who was called the     
{Viscount Templeton.}Ballyutoag        
 National School existed until 1935.   
 Joined onto the National School was   
 the headteacher's home.               
 In the year 1921 the National School  
 system came under the control of the  
 new Northern Ireland Government. It   
 was changed to an Elementary School.  
 However, by the 1930's the number of  
 pupils attending the school had fallen
 to single figures and so, in 1935, the
 school was closed.                    
 The old documents, rollbooks and files
 are still in the school. The people   
 who live in the teachers house have   
 never been in the school until        
 recently as they had no key.
