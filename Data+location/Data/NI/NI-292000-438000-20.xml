money, about 1 or 2 shillings a week,  
which was spent on sweets and          
cigarettes. Unlike today, when you left
school the only thing for you to do    
was to get a job (ie. working on a farm
or in the distillery). Also there      
were very few bikes and radios, and    
newspapers were the only way of finding
out national news.

broadcasting  stations.                </content>
