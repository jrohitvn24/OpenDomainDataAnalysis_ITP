		<title>05PLANE CRASH</title>
		<content>    On Christmas Eve 1944 an American  
 built Wildcat, J.V. 482 crashed       
 returning to base from Sydenham       
 Airport,Belfast. It crashed into      
 Portmore Lough, in the S.W. corner of 
 this block. The pilot was rescued by  
 two local farmers.                    
    Forty years on in April 1984, the  
 aircraft was raised from the lough by 
 the Ulster Aviation Society. The plane
 was well preserved, the engine in near
 perfect condition: the tyres still    
 held the 40 year-old air, and 15      
 gallons of 100 octane    aviation fuel
 was found to be in perfect condition. 
    The plane was moved to suitable    
 premises in Belfast and will be the   
 centre of a new aviation museum.      
    A fitting climax to the saga saw   
 the emotional meeting of the pilot,   
 Peter Lock with William and Seamus    
 Kane his rescuers on a fateful day.   </content>
