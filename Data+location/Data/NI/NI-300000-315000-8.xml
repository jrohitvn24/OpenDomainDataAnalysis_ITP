		<content> The most common breeds of cattle kept 
 in the area are {friesan}-the most    
 popular breed for milk production -{  
{Hereford, Charolois, Limousin, }and   
{Simmental}which are todays popular    
 beef production breeds. The last three
 named breeds have been introduced in  
 recent years from the Continent and   
 have largely replaced such breeds as  
{Shorthorn }and{Aberdeen Angus.}  The  
 principal food for these animals is   
 grass.For winter feed large quantities
 of grass is saved as hay or stored    
 as{silage}in huge sheds called{silos. 
 Years age every farm had small flocks 
 of{hens,ducks}and{turkeys}running free
 around the farmyard. Today hardly any 
 are to be seen. Some farmers who      
 specalize in rearing these birds in { 
{purpose-built}houses now supply the   
 market with eggs and poultry products.
