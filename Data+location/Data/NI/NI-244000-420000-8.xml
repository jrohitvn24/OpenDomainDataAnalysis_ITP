		<title>08HISTORY OF BROOKHALL HOUSE</title>
		<content>     Brookhall,half km to the North of 
 Boomhall,was built in the 18th century
 Its former owner was Sir George Hill  
 but Gilliland family have owned it for
 over 150yrs.It is a magnificent house 
 set out with beautiful gardens and    
 trees with 100_120 acres of farmland. 
 The farming of the land did not start 
 until 1855.Today crops eg.barley and  
 potatoes are grown and are shipped    
 abroad.Most of the land has been let. 
 The interior of the house is a good   
 size but has changed in the last      
 century.Extensions have been built.It 
 has false windows and is now square   
 shaped.The interior is beautifully    
 decorated with curtains and wallpaper 
 made by William Morris.Mr.Gilliland   
 inherited Brookhall from his uncle and
 his son will inherit it from          
 him.Brookhall will always remain      
 magnificent.                          </content>
