		<title>08A VISIT TO A JERSEY FARM</title>
		<content>   On Tuesday,7th May,1985,we went to  
 visit one of the farms in our area.We 
 chose Mr.Lindsay's farm because his   
 whole dairy herd is made up of Jersey 
 cattle,the only full Jersey herd in   
 N.Ireland.We would like to share our  
 visit with you and what information we
 have gained about Mr.Lindsay's Jersey 
 herd.                                 
{GETTING THERE_}We travelled by car to 
 the farm on a warm sunny afternoon.On 
 the way there was a wasp climbing up  
 Johnny's neck.We had to stop and open 
 the doors to let it out.              
{OUR ARRIVAL_}We were introduced to Mr.
 Lindsay and his son.He told us to walk
 around the farm and farm buildings.   
 After that he said he would tell us   
 about his farm and Jersey cattle and  
 would answer our questions.Mr.Lindsay 
 was a very nice man and he had a      
 lovely herd of Jersey cows.           </content>
