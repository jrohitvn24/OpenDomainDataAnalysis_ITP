		<content> In Ballycastle, many private houses   
 are being built all the time. Many are
 single storey and some are double     
 storey. A lot of the older houses are 
 multi_storey. On each housing estate  
 or road, the houses are built to a    
 similar design. Most have a garden or 
 an open space nearby.                 
 Major housing estates in Ballycastle  
 are{Altananam, Knocklayd View,        
{Dalriada Gardens}and{Mayo Drive.}     
 The average rent is just under Â£20 per
 week, and is paid through the Post    
 Office Giro System. People on         
 supplementary benefit do not pay rent.
 The{Executive}collects rent and also  
 makes repairs, especially on old      
 estates. They built extensively in the
 1970s, but there is little building   
 done now.
