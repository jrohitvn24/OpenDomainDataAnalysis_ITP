		<title>10CULMORE CHURCH</title>
		<content>      In 1688 a church was erected to  
 serve the needs of the large garrison 
 at Culmore Fort.During the siege of   
 Derry (1689)it was used as a hospital 
 which housed over 400 wounded men.    
 Later it was used as stables and when 
 King James army retreated from Derry  
 they burnt it.The old church was 54ft 
 long and it had a square tower.Part of
 the ruins are still standing in the   
 churchyard.It was part of the parish  
 at Templemore.The present church was  
 rebuilt in 1867.In 1921 the churches  
 of Culmore and Muff united to form one
 parish,a somewhat unique parish,having
 one church in N.Ireland and one in    
 S.Ireland.The Irish Society has helped
 the church financially on many        
 occasions and many of the older       
 families of the parish have also      
 contributed to its restoration.
