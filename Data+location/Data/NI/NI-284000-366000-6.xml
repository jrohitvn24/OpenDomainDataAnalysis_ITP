		<title>06FIRST COMMUNION/ COALISLAND.</title>
		<content> In order to receive{Holy Communion}we 
 had to attend{Mass.}We had prepared   
 very well for this ceremony and most  
 of us took part in some small way.    
 Some children did the readings, others
 carried the gifts in the Offertory    
 Procession. All of us joined in the   
 hymn singing. We felt very proud      
 walking up the centre of the church   
 with our parents to receive{Holy      
{Communion}for the first time.After the
 ceremomny was over we had our         
 photographs taken and then we went    
 with our parents for a celebration    
 dinner. After the meal it is the      
 custom to visit relatives and friends 
 who give you money. A survey in the   
 class showed that the amounts received
 varied from Â£25 to Â£80 per person.
