		<title>16HOUSING IN ROUGHFORT</title>
		<content>{ Housing in Roughfort has changed     
{quite a lot recently}.                
  Many years ago the housing in        
 Roughfort was just small houses and   
 farms,which contained only a kitchen, 
 a bedroom and a big open fire to cook 
 on.Most of the old houses had straw   
 roofs(thatched),now there are only two
 of these thatched houses in the whole 
 of Roughford.                         
  there was no electicity,so families  
 had to relay on small parafin lamps to
 light their homes.                    
  The families in those days were      
 usually quite large,consisting of     
 seven or eight people in each,it is   
 now a wonder how they all survived in 
 such poor conditions.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
