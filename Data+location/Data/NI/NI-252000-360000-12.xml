		<content> Mr.Mc Sorley is an average size small 
 farmer.He farms 25 hectares.He has 35 
 Fresian cows and a bull.He keeps his  
 cows for producing{milk.}The cows are 
 milked twice a day,in the morning and 
 in the evening.They are brought into  
 the milking parlour and they are      
 milked by a machine.First the milk    
 goes into a container above the cow   
 and then when the container is full it
 goes to a stainless steel refrigerated
 tank.In the winter when the cows are  
 finished milking they go into cubicle 
 sheds but in the summer they go into  
 the fields.Every day in the summer a  
 milk tanker comes to collect the      
 milk.The milk is pumped out into the  
 tanker.The{tanker}takes the milk to   
 Augher Creamery where it is made into 
{butter}and cheese.His main crop is    
 grass which he makes into silage.He   
 uses a forage wagon to collect grass. </content>
