		<title>01Killyleagh, Co.Down.</title>
		<content>   The town of Killyleagh in the County
 of Down Northern Ireland, lies        
 twenty-one miles south of Belfast on  
 the A22 road on the Eastern shore of  
 Strangford Lough. It is set among the 
 rolling drumlins of Down which support
 an agricultural community.            
   The census of 1981 recorded a       
 population of 2094 inhabitants many of
 whom are employed by the Flax Spinning
 Mill and the United Chrome Tanners.   
 Some of the people commute to nearby  
 Downpatrick or Belfast.               
  The town is overlooked by a splendid 
 castle dating back to Norman times.   
 The horse-shoe shaped harbour on the  
 eastern side of the town gives direct 
 access to the Lough, the Ards         
 Peninsula and the Irish sea. It is    
 flanked by the slim spired Parish     
 church sitting high up on a wooded    
 knoll.                                </content>
