		<title>01Lower Bann Valley (part of)</title>
		<content> On either side of the Lower Bann River
 are flat low marsh-lands, bog &amp;       
 meadow  The land rises to form low    
 irregular hills on the west and the   
 lower part of an escarpment on the    
 east. Here are to be found a large    
 number of individual modern           
 homesteads, most belonging to farmers 
 or their relatives. The houses are    
 either strung out along the roads or  
 clustered together irregularly on the 
 higher ground. Peat, cut locally,     
 provides fuel. Those male inhabitants 
 who are not farmers are usually       
 tradesmen who travel out of the area  
 each day to work. Some are both       
 farmers &amp; tradesmen. Farms are        
 generally owner-occupied, of from 20  
 to 50 acres. The land, though         
 improved, is not of very good quality.
 Farming is mainly pastoral. Female    
 employment is provided by Gallagher's </content>
