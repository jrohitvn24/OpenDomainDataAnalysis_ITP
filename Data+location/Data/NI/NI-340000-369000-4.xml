		<title>04RIDING FOR BEGINNERS</title>
		<content> Beginners' lessons are held every     
 Saturday, so Friday is a busy day of  
 preparation for the school. There is  
 no riding on Fridays, for, in addition
 to the usual duties which have to be  
 carried out around the school, the    
 jumping courses have to be planned and
 constructed. A lesson costs Â£3.5O for 
 children and Â£5.OO for adults, and    
 many who come for a course of lessons 
 end up buying a horse from the school.
 Depending on size and age, a horse    
 could cost anything from Â£6OO to      
 Â£2OOO.                                
                                       
 In I983, Caroline Bradley, the British
 international show jumper, visited the
 school to give riding tuition shortly 
 before her sudden death.
