		<title>14Town Development.</title>
		<content> When the Ulster Architecturtal        
 Heritage Society published its        
 findings about the 'Towns and         
 Villages of County Down' in 1973 it   
 criticised the  then new housing      
 development in Frederick street  as   
 being inappropriate to a small        
 town. Since then most of Irish street 
 and Shore street have been redeveloped
 by the Housing Executive for Northern 
 Ireland. The first phase had been     
 completed by 1980 and the second phase
 this year. The architects were highly 
 commended for their attempts to       
 re-create the same layout of small    
 terrace houses and fishermens cottages
 which had previously been on that     
 site, and in some cases the same type 
 of stone facade was used. In many     
 cases the original inhabitants of the 
 house took up residence again once the
 site had been completed.              </content>
