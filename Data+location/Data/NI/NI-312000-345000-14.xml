		<title>14POLITICS IN BANBRIDGE</title>
		<content> The religious divisions of the area   
 mirror political loyalties,which have 
 become more polarized in recent years.
 The majority support the Official or  
 Democratic Unionist Party. This is    
 reflected in the number of members    
 returned to the N.I. Assembly, control
 of Banbridge District Council and the 
 number of M.P.'s returned to          
 Westminster. There is little support  
 for the middle ground, represented by 
 Alliance while most non-unionist      
 support lies with the S.D.L.P. the    
 moderate Catholic party, with little  
 backing for militant republican       
 elements. Locally,the political       
 parties have little power at District 
 Council level,and can be regarded as  
 mere "pressure groups"but they enjoy  
 the advantage of administering an area
 where politicians enjoy good personal 
 relations.                            </content>
