		<content> My  daddy  is a{plough man.}This means
 that he goes to ploughing matches.  In
 Northern  Ireland  there  are about{20
 ploughing{matches}each year.  My daddy
 only  goes  to  about 6 because he can
 get  enough  points  without having to
 pay  more  than Â£16.  He has to pay Â£2
 for  each  ploughing match he goes to.
 The  ploughing matches are mostly on a
 saturday.   On  a  friday night we put
 the tractor and plough on to the lorry
 ready  to  go  to  the  match  in  the
 morning.   To-day  we were at Moneyrea
 ploughing match.  When we got there we
 paid  our  Â£2  then we put{poles}up to
 help  dad  plough  straight then daddy
 did his{split.} He did 16 furrows. The
 person  ploughing  beside my daddy was
 Des Wright.   At  the  end  we went to
 look  at  the  results  and  daddy was
 first!
