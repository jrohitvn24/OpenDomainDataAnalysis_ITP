		<content> Altogether in our area,there are three
 schools,{Cross and Passion College},{ 
{St. Patrick's Boys Primary school,}and
{St.Bridget's Girls Primary school.}The
 three of them are almost beside each  
 other on Moyle Road. St Patrick's is  
 on the opposite side of the road to   
 Cross and Passion,and the church is   
 between the two primary schools.      
 There are 679 pupils at Cross and     
 Passion College, 250 at St. Patrick's 
 and 230 at St.Bridget's.              
 The primary schools take in pupils    
 from the age of 5, and when they have 
 finished there 7 years they go to a   
 secondary school. The majority go to  
 Cross and Passion.The pupils study up 
 to 3rd year when they choose their    
 G.C.E.They study for this for the     
 next two years, and then take their   
 exams.If they pass these then they can
 stay on to do their 'A'levels.        </content>
