		<title>09RACEVIEW MILL</title>
		<content>   The mill is situated opposite the   
 Golf Course on Raceview Road.At one   
 time this old woollen mill provided   
 the main source of employment for the 
 area.The most recent owners were the{ 
{Wilson's}of Ballygarvey.The factory   
 manager before closure was Mr.Noel    
 Crabbe.It has been closed since       
 1980-the numbers employed over the    
 years had diminished and although many
 new machines for weaving had been     
 brought from Italy,the woollen        
 business was not able to compete with 
 synthetic fibres.The premises are now 
 owned by a building contractor from   
 Ballymena,{Mr. David Patton.}He uses  
 them to store building materials and  
 machines.
