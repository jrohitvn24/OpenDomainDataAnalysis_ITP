		<title>11     The M1 Motorway</title>
		<content> The M1 motorway ends just past the    
{roundabout at Stangmore}and since     
 completion in{1968}has been of great  
 benefit to the people of Dungannon and
 beyond.It shortened the journey from  
 Belfast to Dungannon by about 45      
 minutes.The 37 mile journey can now be
 done in half an hour in safety        
 although some serious fatal accidents 
 have occurred when drivers have got on
 to the wrong carriageway.             
      Various contractors completed    
 different sections of the motorway.   
 The last section,the{Laghey section,  
 was opened at{11.00 a.m on Saturday   
{23rd  December,1967.} There was no    
 official opening due to the risk of   
 spreading  'foot and mouth disease'   
 which is a serious animal illness. The
 contractor was{Mr.Graham of Dromore   
 and he completed the{4.25 million     
{pounds}contract 8 months early.       </content>
