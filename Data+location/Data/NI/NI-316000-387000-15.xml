		<content> Very little of the{natural habitat  } 
 remains in the area - 90% is farmland 
 and the remainder is built up.Fields  
 average 2 hectares in size and have   
 been recently drained and improved.   
{Hedgerows}are composed mostly of      
 hawthorne bushes;but scattered along  
 them are trees such as oak and ash    
 with ivy growing on them.             
{Resident birds}include magpies and    
 blackbirds.Swallows and               
 willow-warblers breed here in summer  
 while flocks of fieldfare and redwings
 visit in winter.                      
{Flowers}such as dog-violets and       
 primroses grow along the roadsides    
 while on the motorway verges rowan and
 alder trees have been planted.        
 The fact that dippers breed under     
 bridges suggests that{rivers}are quite
 clean though silage effluent can cause
 pollution in summer.                  </content>
