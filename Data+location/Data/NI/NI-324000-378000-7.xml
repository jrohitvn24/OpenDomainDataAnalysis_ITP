		<content> The houses in this area are built of  
 either concrete blocks, stone or      
 brick. Most people prefered to use    
 stone. In our survey we found that 8  
 people had houses made from stone, 5  
 had houses made from concrete blocks  
 and 4 people had houses made from     
 brick.                                
                                       
 Most of the bungalows or houses are   
 large. 9 out of 18 houses have 2      
 storeys, 6 out of 18 have one storey, 
 2 out of 18 have 1 and a half storeys 
 (bungalow with attic) and 1 out of 18 
 have 3 storeys.                       
                                       
 A lot of the houses are fitted with   
 central heating. This helps because   
 the winter is very cold in the        
 country. 13 families in all have      
 central heating fitted.    cont.
