		<content>    {Dairying }farms supply the local  
 creamery -" Killeen Creamery " -this  
 serves a large radius of farms and    
 also employs a large amount of people 
 from the neighbouring village of      
 Killeen and from Castlderg.           
     The products of the creamery are  
 supplied to many neighbouring towns   
 and villages - as far away as         
 Irvinestown and Omagh. The creamery   
 produces products such as milk,       
 cheese, butter and various other dairy
 produce.                              
     This area is not completely       
 considered a L.F.A. ( less favoured   
 area ), but most farmers do receieve a
 lot of {grants }from the E.E.C. and   
 the British Government. The only      
 problem with these grants is that they
 are very slow in being paid out.
