		<title>11THE HISTORY OF ROUGHFORT</title>
		<content>  A map of Carnmoney district c.1600   
 clearly shows the areas of            
 Ballynabarnish,Carngranny,Craigarogan,
 Umgall.                               
  The examples below are quoted in the 
 Tithe Collection for Carnmoney in the 
 year 1615.                            
  "Emgall(Umgall has a parsonage       
 endowed,probably the townland of      
 Ricamore)"                            
  "Carnigrane has one quarter gleib(30 
 Irish acres)"                         
  The tithe was a tax paid by all      
 churches  to the Church of Ireland and
 this was resented by non Anglicans and
 no doubt by these parishes.           
  In the 17th century religious        
 problems predominated in Co.Antrim as 
 they did in the rest of Ireland.      
 Presbyterianism grew and was to be a  
 growing influence and an important    
 factor in the events of 1798.         </content>
