		<title>11A TYPICAL FARM IN ARTIGARVAN</title>
		<content> Farmers mainly grow{potatoes}and      
{barley}in our area, for the land is   
 very fertile and low-lying.{Dairying  
 is the main type of animal farming.My 
 father owns 11O acres and leases      
 approx-1OO acres from a neighbouring  
 farmer.We have 92 milking cows and 71 
 calves.There are also 35 heifers,     
 which are in calf.We keep some hens   
 for our own use.In all, we have 22O   
 animals.                              
 Our main crop is potatoes.We grow some
 for ourselves and the surplus is sold.
 We cut barley with our own combine    
 harvestor.Years ago, we had to get a  
 neighbour to cut the barley for us.The
 barley is stored for winter,to feed   
 the cows.Other winter fodder includes 
 5O acres of silage.To do the work, we 
 have 6 tractors,which are extensively 
 used.We are the only Dairy farmers,   
 within a 1 mile radius of our farm.   </content>
