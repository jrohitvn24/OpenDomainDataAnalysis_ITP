		<content> Although the land covered by the block
 could not be described as a tourist   
 area,it is one of great natural       
 beauty.The main scenic attraction is  
 the forest,which covers about 15% of  
 the whole area.There is a small       
 caravan park on the edge of the forest
 but there are no amenities on site.   
 This is aimed at keeping the number of
 campers to a minimum so that the peace
 and beauty of the area is not         
 distroyed.The forest is frequented in 
 the summer months by day trippers who 
 enjoy its pleasent walks,perhaps      
 picnic,and then return home.          
 There are a few holiday homes in the  
 area,consisting of small refurbished  
 houses.                               
 There is also Tourist Board approved  
 farmhouse accomodation,but this is    
 more often used by people on business 
 in the area.                          </content>
