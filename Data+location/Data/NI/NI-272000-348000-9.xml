		<content>   At this time of the year the{bird   
{song}in our area is very pleasant. We 
 also have our summer visitors here_   
 the swallow and cuckoo. The starlings 
 are providing a noisy welcome in our  
 area.                                 
    We have{squirrels}in a small wooded
 area. Although we did not sight a fox 
 or badger there was evidence of their 
 existence_ we found their homes and   
 some of the children had viewed them  
 in the evenings. The only hedgehogs we
 viewed were those killed on the road. 
{Frogs}too, judging by the amount of   
 frogspawn we found are common in our  
 area.                                 
    We found some{wood lice}in decaying
 wood.Spiders were enjoying themselves 
 in our windows. Turning over stones we
 found bettles and earwigs.            
   A nature walk in our area is a most 
 interesting venture.                  </content>
