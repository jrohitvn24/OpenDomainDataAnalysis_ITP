		<title>12THE POTATO INSPECTOR</title>
		<content> Every morning apart from Saturdays and
 holidays my dad goes into the         
 Agriculture Office.  From about 8.30am
 to 9.00am potato farmers call him by  
 telephone to say that they are ready  
 to see him.  He writes their name and 
 address down on his diary, and when   
 9.00am comes he sets off.  Usually the
 people that call him know him and he  
 has no bother finding their houses.   
 Not all potatoes are grown for the    
 same reason.  Some are grown as seed. 
 Most are grown for people to eat, and 
 the small ones are used to feed pigs. 
 Those potatoes that do not go to the  
 shops can be dyed to make them look   
 nasty.  When this happens the farmer  
 gets a subsidy, but only after the    
 potato inspector has been to the farm.
 My daddy also inspects for blight,    
 scab and other diseases.
