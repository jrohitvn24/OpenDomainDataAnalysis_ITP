		<title>02   THE BOG MEADOWS (1)</title>
		<content>   The one major recent change which   
 many local people mentioned was the   
 'disappearance' of the Bog Meadows,   
 said to have been the last of the     
 great marshy areas of Belfast. It was 
 the extent of this wetland which had  
 largely determined the path of the    
 'new' Lisburn Road and later in 1839  
 the first railway line in Ulster - the
 Ulster Railway,the first stretch of   
 which ran from Belfast to Lisburn.    
   At one time the 'Meadows' were an   
 oasis for many species of wildlife.   
 One senior citizen recalled that the  
 Meadows were their favourite          
 playground--"Nothing but grass and the
 river and there we spent many happy   
 hours. We didn't have, nor did we need
 any fancy adventure playgrounds or    
 leisure centres."
