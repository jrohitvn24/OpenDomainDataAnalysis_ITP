		<title>18GHOST STORIES, DERVOCK.</title>
		<content> There are many folk tales told in our 
 district. Here are versions of two.   
{THE GREY LADY.}She is said to haunt   
 Montgomery's House at Benvarden. One  
 night as a man walked home past the   
 chapel, a little girl walked out in   
 front of him. Since it was after      
 midnight he asked her if it wasn't a  
 bit late for her to be out. She turned
 round. Her face was that of an old    
 woman and very wrinkled. She ran into 
 the bushes and disappeared.           
{THE BLACK MAN.}He was supposed to be  
 buried in Paddy's Field and is said to
 haunt the nearby rectory. One night a 
 man walking across the field bumped   
 into a dark figure, wearing a black   
 cloak and hat. He started to run.     
 The figure ran after him. The man fell
 into the Black Man's empty grave and  
 lay there till the morning_too        
 frightened to move.                   </content>
