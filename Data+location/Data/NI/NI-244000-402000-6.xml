		<content> In the Donemana district there are    
 numerous signs of surface mining,not  
 only for limestone,but for gravel and 
 road materials.Apart from the         
 limestone quarries in Tirconnelly and 
 Drain there are remains of kilns      
 around the area.The quarries were in  
 operation until recently and many men 
 were employed in this lightly         
 mechanised industry.Apart from the    
 limestone there are large quanties of 
 sand and gravel.Even in the village   
 itself two sandpits were in working   
 order until recently.The sand and     
 gravel from these were used for       
 drainage schemes and also for house   
 building.One of the sandpits is now   
 exhausted and the residents complained
 about the other as it was too near to 
 their houses and it also spoilt the   
 beauty of the area                    
                                       </content>
