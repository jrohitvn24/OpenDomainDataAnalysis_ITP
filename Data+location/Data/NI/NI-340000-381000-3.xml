  The shoreline along our area is      
 mainly composed of headlands,about 3  
 to 5 metres high,and bayhead beaches. 
  The shore is very rocky and there is 
 a lot of seaweed.The  beaches are     
 mainly broken down shells and         
 pebbles.The water is very polluted due
 to the power station and factories on 
 the opposite shore and to leakages    
 from the many tankers passing along   
 the sealane.                          
  Offshore there is a wave cut platform
 of hard rock covered with small stones
 where the coast has been worn back.   
 There is also a former blow-hole      
 channel, about 3.5 metres tall and 1  
 metre wide,where the top has collapsed
 There is a number of small streams    
 which have flowed down the hillside   
 and into the sea, but none is more    
 than about l metre wide. (CONTINUED)  </content>
