		<content>   Kingmoss is so called because       
 William of Orange camped there on his 
 way to Carrick Fergus.                
   Sentry Hill belongs to the family   
 who built Carnmony Village. It is a   
 secluded storybook house with         
 furniture, pictures, kitchen utensils,
 books, belongings from every          
 generation who lived there.           
   In the attics is a collection of    
 toys and curios. Behind the diningroom
 is an ancient victorian bathroom, the 
 first one installed in N.E. Antrim.   
 There are portraits of girls in their 
 presentation dresses and trains.      
   Mr. Corr of Corr's Corner told us   
 that his widowed grandmother came     
 back from New Zealand with his father 
 and bought a public house in Co.      
 Armagh. On her sons marriage the      
 family sold up and came to Belfast,   
 intending to return to New Zealand.   </content>
