		<content> THE DENNETT FLOWS THROUGH OUR AREA.IT 
 IS A SMALL TRIBUTARY OF THE FOYLE.IN  
 THE 1950'S THERE WERE MORE TREES ABOUT
 IT BUT THESE WERE CUT DOWN AND USED   
 FOR FIREWOOD WHEN THE RIVER WAS BEING 
 DRAINED AND WIDENED TO PREVENT FLOODS.
 THERE ARE SOME DEEP HOLES IN THE SMALL
 TRIBUTARY AND IT IS SOMETIMES RISKY TO
 SWIM IN.THE FOYLE FISHERY HAD TRIED TO
 STOCK THE DENNETT WITH SALMON BUT THE 
 EGGS KEEP DISAPPEARING.IT WAS REALISED
 SHORTLY AFTER THAT ANOTHER TYPE OF    
 SALMON WAS EATING THE EGGS AND LAYING 
 ITS OWN.IT IS CALLED THE BLACK SALMON.
 THE STRABANE CANAL FLOWS TO THE FOYLE 
 AND SINCE THE CANAL CLOSED THE ROACH  
 HAVE MOVED IN.MANY SALMON AND BROWN   
 TROUT INHABIT THE RIVER.THE FISHING   
 SEASON LASTS FROM APRIL 1ST UNTIL OCT.
 31ST.POACHING IS A PASTIME FOR MANY OF
 THE LOCALS.
