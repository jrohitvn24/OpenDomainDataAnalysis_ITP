		<title>17THE SCHOOL FETE</title>
		<content> The School Fete is held each year on  
 the second Saturday of June. This year
 the proceedings started with a Fancy  
 Dress Parade through the village led  
 by the Eglinton Accordion Band, but   
 unfortunately the rain started when we
 reached the school field. However     
 there were still a lot of interesting 
 things to see and do. The mums rushed 
 to one of the tents to buy the cakes  
 donated by many of the parents. Some  
 boys and girls climbed up scaffolding 
 and tried abseiling. There were       
 various stalls hot-dogs, minerals and 
 ice-cream. Many people enjoyed the    
 Irish Dancing display and some tried  
 their luck at the bottle stall. There 
 was a raffle for a portable colour TV 
 and other prizes. Several of the older
 ladies entered the Glamorous Granny   
 contest but the BMX stunt display and 
 the Novelty Races had to be cancelled.</content>
