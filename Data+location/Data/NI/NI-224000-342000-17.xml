		<content>   The public dump covers some 12 acres
 with  a further 6 acres in reserve.   
 The area once was a lightly  wooded   
 valley which was excavated to 18      
 metres.Rubbish is collected from all  
 over Fermanagh in 6 bin lorries,each  
 with a capacity of 17 tonnes. There   
 are 10 lorry loads per working day.   
 Collections are also made in 11 mobile
 skips serviced by 2 skip lorries. To  
 prevent disease &amp; festation by vermin 
 the waste is disposed of in layers    
 covered by soil. Further precautions  
 include spraying insecticide,spreading
 poison for rat control, &amp; a gas-gun to
 keep the birds at bay. A dog pound has
 been completed in 1985 &amp; it is        
 situated at the entrance to the dump. 
 Some 600 abandoned cars are stored    
 yearly awaiting the mobile crusher    
 from the east of the Province.
