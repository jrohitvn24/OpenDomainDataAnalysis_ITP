		<title>06THE 13th JULY IN SCARVA</title>
		<content> In 1690 King William III defeated King
 James II at the Battle Of The Boyne.  
 In Scarva they celebrate King         
 William's victory on the 13th July    
 every year.                           
 There are bands which parade through  
 Scarva.  There is a dressed  up King  
 William who parades in front of the   
 bands.                                
 The Royal Black Preceptory march      
 behind the bands.  There are about    
 forty thousand people come to Scarva  
 to watch the parade.   There are lots 
 of stalls where people buy things.    
 There is a sham fight each year when  
 there is a mock battle between dressed
 up armies of WilliamIII and  James II.
  Of course King William's Army is     
 always victorious.                    
 In the Demense there is a tree under  
 which it is believed King William     
 spent a night.                        </content>
