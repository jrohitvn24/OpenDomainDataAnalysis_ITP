		<title>19HISTORY OF AGHADOWEY</title>
		<content>   Aghadowey,an area{rich in history,  
 includes several{listed buildings     
 _farm residences,a former manse,large 
 houses formerly occupied by linen     
 merchants.One of the most interesting 
 is the{watch-hut at Ballybrittain}with
 its curious brick chimneys.           
   Great{stones}such as that at{Crevola
 denote the presence of{Neolithic man  
 in this area and many of the local    
 farmhouses were originally built of   
 stone, some of which came from        
 souterrains. Aghadowey itself means   
 either{"field of Duffy"or"the black   
{field".}It was planted in the early   
 17th century by the{Ironmongers'      
 company. In the 18th century because  
 of poverty and restrictions in        
 religious freedom many decided to     
 leave for America.In 1718 Rev.M'Gregor
{emigrated}to New England with a number
 of the Presbyterian congregation.     </content>
