		<title>11Ecology- Strangford Lough.</title>
		<content>  Many of the small islands in         
 Strangford Lough are owned privately  
 or by the{National Trust.}Many of the 
 former are also managed by the        
 National Trust.                       
  Green Island which rises from the    
 lough directly opposite Killyleagh is 
 owned by the Trust and let to farmers 
 for agricultural use,mainly for       
 grazing cattle,and it is fascinating  
 to see the flat-bottomed boat setting 
 out from the harbour loaded with      
 cattle.                               
  Many of the other islands are        
 particularly important for birdlife,  
 and in some cases the public are      
 prohibited from landing on the islands
 because of the nesting birds,some of  
 which have government protection. The 
 Trust maintains a careful monitoring  
 of the birds.
