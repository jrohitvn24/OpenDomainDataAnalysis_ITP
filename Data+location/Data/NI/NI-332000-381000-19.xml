		<content>      On the last two pages of our     
 Domesday Project we decided to write  
 about what people think about the area
 we have descibed on the pages before. 
      Most people thought that living  
 in the area as a whole was quite good.
 Here are some of the things that they 
 mentioned.                            
      Some think that Rathcoole Estate 
 is all right while others think it is 
 spoiled by graffiti and some rundown  
 houses.                               
      Shopping at{Abbey Centre}is very 
 good as well as{Abbots Cross. }       
      The{Valley Leisure Centre}is very
 good although not everyone goes to it 
 regularly.                            
     {Schools}are thought to be quite  
 good while the{Hospital}and{Health    
{Centre}are not so well thought of.    
     {Parks}are reasonably good and    
 there are open areas to play in.      </content>
