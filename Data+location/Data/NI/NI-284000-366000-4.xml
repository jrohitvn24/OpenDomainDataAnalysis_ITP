		<title>04CHRISTENING IN COALISLAND</title>
		<content> Certain customs are associated with   
 the{Christening.}Some parents will not
 take the baby out of the house until  
 he is christened incase of an         
 accident. The baby receives gifts. The
 Godparents usually buy him a silver   
 Christening mug. He may also receive a
 silver coin known as a crown. Money is
 given to the baby, a custom which is  
 known as 'HANSLING'. This is meant to 
 ensure that the baby will always have 
 money in the future. At the party     
 after the Christening there will be an
 iced cake. If the baby is the         
 firstborn this cake may be the top    
 tier of his parent's wedding cake kept
 specially for the Christening.
