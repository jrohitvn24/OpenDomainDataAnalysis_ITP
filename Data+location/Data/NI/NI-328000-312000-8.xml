		<content> SPONSORSHIP FOR THE FESTIVAL TAKES THE
 FORM OF A GRANT FROM THE LOCAL        
 COUNCIL.  THE AIM IS FOR EACH EVENT TO
 BE SELF SUPPORTING BUT SOME DO REQUIRE
 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO SUCCEED.      
 CAREFUL BUDGETING IS THEREFORE NEEDED,
 ESPECIALLY AS THERE HAS NOT BEEN A    
 GREAT RESPONSE FROM LOCAL BUSINESSES. 
 THIS BEING THE TENTH YEAR IT IS HOPED 
 TO INCLUDE THREE SPECIAL EVENTS,  A   
 MOURNE RAMBLE, A PARACHUTE DISPLAY AND
 A PIPE BAND CONTEST.  IT IS HOPED THAT
 THE 10 MILE RAMBLE WILL ENCOURAGE MANY
 PEOPLE TO TAKE THE OPPODRTUNITY TO    
 VIEW THE SCENIC MOURNES.              
 THE "WILD GEESE" PARACHUTIST TEAM WILL
 BE THE STAR ATTRACTION OF THE         
 FESTIVAL.  THEY ARE SCHEDULED TO GIVE 
 A DISPLAY WITH ASSISTANCE FROM PLUCKY 
 LOCAL VOLUNTEERS!  ON AUGUST 24TH A   
 PIPE BAND CONTEST WILL TAKE PLACE.
