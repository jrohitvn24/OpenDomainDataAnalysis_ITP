		<content> The geography of the area divides into
 two main sections - with the very low 
 lying flood plain of the River Lagan  
 in the north west (NB one of the      
 recurrent problems of the Hillhall    
 area is that of flooding ) and the    
 Drumlin hills of the south and east.  
                                       
 A line drawn diagonally across the    
 area from south-west to north-east    
 marks this progression and the south  
 and east display numerous examples of 
 Drumlin hills.  These hills provide a 
 good example of a "basket of eggs"    
 landscape associated with glacial     
 deposits.                             
                                       
 The average height of the flood plain 
 is approximately 10 metres, while the 
 highest point of the Drumlins is 52   
 metres.
