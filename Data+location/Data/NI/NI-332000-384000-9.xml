		<title>09THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT</title>
		<content> APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF THE AREA  
 IS RURAL. THERE IS A NATURAL DIVIDING 
 LINE BETWEEN THE RURAL AND URBAN      
 LANDSCAPE IN THE FORM OF THE B90 OLD  
 CARRICK ROAD. THERE IS A SMALL FOREST 
 AREA, NOT COMMERCIAL G.R.3384 AND SOME
 LINEAR OR RIBBON DEVELOPMENT IN THE   
 FORM OF PRIVATELY OWNED BUNGALOWS ON  
 THE B94 CARNTALL ROAD.                
    IN THE REMAINDER THERE ARE         
 DISPERSED SETTLEMENTS, MAINLY FARMS   
 ALTHOUGH THERE IS A FEW RECENTLY BUILT
 PRIVATELY OWNED HOUSES ESPECIALLY ON  
 THE KNOCKAGH ROAD WHICH OFFERS A      
 COMMANDING VEIW OF BELFAST LOUGH.     
    THE LAND USE IS PRIMARILY ROUGH    
 GRAZING, ON WHAT IS MARGINAL LAND, FOR
 CATTLE AND SHEEP AND A LITTLE ARABLE  
 FARMING FOR FODDER CROPS AND POTATOES.
    ONE NOTABLE FEATURE OF THE AREA IS 
 THE RUINS OF MONKSTOWN CHURCH, THOUGHT
 TO DATE BACK TO EARLY CHRISTIAN TIMES.</content>
