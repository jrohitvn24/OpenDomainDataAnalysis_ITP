		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE(DUNDONALD)</title>
		<content>  "Wake up John and get washed " called
 my mother,so dutifully I rose and     
 shuffled into the bathroom. Doning my 
 school uniform,I had my breakfast of  
 cereal and coffee before setting off  
 on my paper round.When I returned     
 mother drove me to school with my     
 sister Catherine.I was late as usual  
 and had to run through the side door  
 instead of lining up with the rest of 
 the class.                            
   "Pass in your homework "commanded   
 Mrs Alford our teacher . The usual    
 morning lessons passed uneventfully.  
 Most people eat a packed lunch before 
 going out to play football,hunt or    
 stick in the mud. On Monday and       
 Wednesday we have history taught by P1
 teacher Mrs.Hutton.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
