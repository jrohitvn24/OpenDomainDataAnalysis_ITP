		<title>03FARMING, FISHING</title>
		<content> There is fishing as well as work on   
 the land.Nowadays fishing is          
 restricted to the inshore type,when in
 the Autumn during late September small
 boats called skiffs fish for herring  
 along the coast.When the catch is     
 brought in some of it is sold on the  
 quay but the rest goes to the fish    
 factory where they are processed.First
 they are stored in barrels with salt, 
 and then they are taken out and       
 smoked.They are then packed for the   
 markets,and some are shipped as far   
 away as France and Italy.             
 15 boats between 20 and 30 feet in    
 size catch the herring. The prices    
 vary from year to year. In 1982 a cran
 cost Â£25, in 1983 Â£20 and in 1984 a   
 cran cost Â£22. A cran is four boxes.
