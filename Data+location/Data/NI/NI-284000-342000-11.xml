 what the people in our area do in     
 their spare time,whether they go to   
 bingo,youth centres or other sorts of 
 clubs and why they go there ?         
   There is only one recreation centre 
 in our area which is called the       
 Milford Institute but is better known 
 as the Milford Social Club.This       
 institute has been open since 1902.The
 centre has become outdated but it is  
 still an outstanding building.Inside  
 the centre there is football,snooker, 
 darts and also has a lounge.They play 
 bingo once a week.This institute is   
 very well known for it's friendly     
 atmosphere.The members of the         
 institute pay an annual fee of Â£4 per
