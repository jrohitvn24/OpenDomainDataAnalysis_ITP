		<content> Physically this area is dominated by  
 the North Inner Dundrum Bay. The land 
 in the block slopes down to this      
 stretch of mudflat from East and West.
 The Blackstaff and Ardilea rivers     
 drain into the Bay. Cloughram Hill    
 (89m) at 403378 is the highest point  
 in the block. Dundrum Castle is also  
 built on a prominent knoll. Dundrum is
 a small village which is mainly a     
 dormitory town for Belfast and        
 Downpatrick. It also has a service    
 function for the surrounding          
 countryside. Its tourist potential is 
 considerably overshadowed by Newcastle
 to the South. Ballykinlar in the      
 extreme South-East of the block is an 
 RAF station associated with the Firing
 Range to the South. The line of the   
 old Belfast railway line from 410373  
 to beyond 419390 has been managed as a
 Nature Reserve by the National Trust. </content>
