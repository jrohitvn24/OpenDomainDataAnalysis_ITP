		<content>The bedrock of this area is lower old  
red sandstone.                         
The area around Trillick is covered    
with glacial deposits which have       
formed numerous small hills and        
intervening valleys. Small bogs have   
formed at the base of these hills      
because of poor drainage.              
In these poorly drained areas marsh    
plants are succeeded by bog vegation.  
There are few lakes which are of great 
scenic value.                          
Agriculture management has created a   
landscape of small fields, mainly      
pasture with high thorn hedges and     
random trees such as ash and sycamore. 
Brougher mountain dominates the        
skyline to the south-east.             
On the highest peak of this mountain   
the BBC transmitters are placed to     
ensure a good picture to television    
watchers in the area.                  </content>
