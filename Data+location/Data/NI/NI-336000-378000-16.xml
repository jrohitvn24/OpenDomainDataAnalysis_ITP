		<title>16THE MOTTE</title>
		<content>    The Motte is situated a few yards  
 to the north-west of Brook Street.  It
 is an earthen artificial mound,       
 approximately fifteen feet high and   
 thirty-seven feet across at the       
 summit, in the shape of a truncated   
 cone, thrown up for defence purposes. 
    Holywood Motte formed part of a    
 chain of such defensive forts erected 
 by John de Courcy across Eastern      
 Ulster in the late twelfth century.   
    In the course of King John's       
 invasion of Ulster, in 1210, he spent 
 one night at the "Castle of Holywood" 
 which was undoubtedly the Motte.  At  
 the top of the Motte there was a small
 timber residence in the middle, ringed
 with a stout wooden palisade.         
    Nowadays, the chief function of the
 Motte is as a site of antiquity.
