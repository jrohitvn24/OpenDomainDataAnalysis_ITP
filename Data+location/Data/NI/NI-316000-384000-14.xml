		<content> On the Block is Muckmore Abbey        
 Hospital.  The hospital was built in  
 l958 and was a purpose built unit for 
 the care and treatment of physically  
 and mentally Handicapped patients.    
 Included in the hospital setting are  
 workshops, training residents for     
 employment.  A training centre trains 
 residents in self help and social     
 skills to enable them to live in      
 hostels within the community.  A      
 swimming pool and sports pavilion have
 been built providing therapeutic and  
 recreational facilities for all the   
 residents.  A community centre is the 
 most recent facility to be provided.  
 A special care school for 40 mentally 
 handicapped pupils is also within the 
 hospital grounds.  Many of these      
 facilities have been provided by      
 voluntary subscriptions. At present   
 the hospital has approx.788 residents.</content>
