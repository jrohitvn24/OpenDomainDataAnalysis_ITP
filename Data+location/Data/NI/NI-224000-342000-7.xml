		<content>   Recreational areas are becoming much
 more important, as the majority of    
 people now have a lot more leisure    
 time. Facilities required must cater  
 for more than the sports enthusiast.  
 At Forthill there is a 6 acre park    
 including gardens, walks &amp; play areas,
 easy accessible from Belmore St. Off  
 the Dublin Road there is an outdoor   
 bowling green &amp; pavillion. At         
 Castlecoole there is a 9 hole golf    
 course which has a large club         
 membership of men &amp; womem. At Cooper  
 Crescent there are 4 hard tennis      
 courts - coaching &amp; matches are       
 organised during the summer months.   
   At the bottom of Derrychara there is
 a soccer pitch, games are played here 
 several times per week. In each of the
 public housing estates play areas are 
 built for the younger children.
