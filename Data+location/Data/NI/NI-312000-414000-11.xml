		<title>11SPRING STORM.</title>
		<content>{On Friday the 24th April  1981}we had 
 the worst spring snow storm in living 
 memory. A high{North  East wind}blew  
 snow into drifts.Roads were blocked   
 and cars stranded.The snow was 10 feet
 high in lanes and many people were    
 stranded in their houses{.Parkmore}was
 closed from 3.00 p.m.on Friday and    
 stranded cars were towed out.{Snow    
{ploughs and  snow blowers}were full   
 time on the roads making them safe.   
 Alex Swan a postman had his leg       
 taken off because of a serious        
 accident Electricity and              
 telephones were cut off and many old  
 people had no way to contact for help.
 A car blew over the hedge but the man 
 escaped without injury.               
       Not many winters pass without   
 heavy snow and drifting .
