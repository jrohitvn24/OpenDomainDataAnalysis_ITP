		<content> Cushendun village lies in picturesque 
 surroundings in pinewoods at the lower
 end of Glendun. Whereas modern local  
 authority housing has been  sited on  
 river terraces further upstream       
 towards the hamlet of Knocknacarry,   
 the core of the village in the former 
 O'Neill estate was built immediately  
 in                                    
 the sandy grassland that slopes to the
 pebbly beach and the tiny harbour. The
 layout and architecture ws the product
 of the imaginative of eccentric, mind 
 of Clough Williams Ellis, the builder 
 of  Portmeinon in Snowdonia, and as   
 such its typically English styles seem
 out of place here. Nevertheless the   
 villageand its environs have undoubted
 charm and are regular destinations for
 summer tourists. The village is now a 
 conversation area owned by the        
 National Trust.                       </content>
