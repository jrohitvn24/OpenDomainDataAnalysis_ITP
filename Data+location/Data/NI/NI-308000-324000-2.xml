		<content> INDUSTRY NEWRY'S ELECTRICAL FACTORY   
 Glen Electrics came to Newry because  
 of the high unemployment here and     
 because of the grants offered by the  
 IDB.                                  
     They knew from research they could
 expect high sales.The expanding       
 factory which has just acquired       
 Morphy-Richards an internationally    
 known factory now sells 83% of its    
 production in G.B.,2% in N.I.,5% in   
 Europe and 10% elsewhere.Over their   
 twelve years in business they         
 have found Newry workers to be        
 excellent.The forty hour a week       
 employees get equal wages and equal   
 opportunities.They also get 4 weeks   
 holidays and 10 statutory             
 holidays.They have a committee        
 responsible for the factorie's hygiene
 and good employer-employee            
 relationships.                        </content>
