		<title>07Farming in Dungiven</title>
		<content> Farming in Dungiven area is mixed,    
 with small family farms keeping cattle
 sheep and pigs.and using much of the  
 land to provide Winter feed such as   
 silage,barley and turnips.Dungiven has
 always been a good potato growing area
 .The land in the Roe valley is fertile
 but it is narrow and soon climbs on   
 either side towards the Sperrin       
 Mountains.Here on the hillsides,hardy 
 hill cattle and sheep are reared.     
 Dungiven has two cattle marts         
 operating all year round every        
 Saturday.The sheep sales take place in
 September,October and November and    
 attract large crowds every Tuesday.   
 The Young Farmers Club organises      
 functions and competitions for its    
 members.A very popular leisure pastime
 among farmers is training sheep dogs  
 for trials as seen in the programme   
 "One Man and His Dog."                </content>
