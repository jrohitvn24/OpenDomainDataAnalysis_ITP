		<title>10TYPICAL DAY (Cont'd)</title>
		<content> 12,20 Lunchtime! To-day 3 of us had   
 "limited permission to go down the    
 fields birdwatching. Saw a grey-backed
 crow, horrible brute. We've also noted
 blackbird,thrush,wagtail,robin, tits  
 of course, and last winter, fieldfare 
 and lapwings, oh and a blackcap(wow!) 
 13.00 Back to Geography. Some days    
 it's History then at 14.00 we have    
 P.E., music, or needlecraft or glory  
 be,netball.                           
     This summer term is best. We've   
 just won several netball matches      
 against other schools. I believe the  
 boys managed a win at football-vulgar 
 game.I must say I'll be sorry to leave
 here. Recent school trips were a      
 treat, and after all I'm a SENIOR     
 here. Soon I'll be a JUNIOR at my     
 second-level school. Mum says time    
 will fix that. I can't see it. Can    
 you? Really?                          </content>
