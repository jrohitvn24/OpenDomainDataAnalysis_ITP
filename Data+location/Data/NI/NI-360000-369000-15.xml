		<content>    Most of the people in Ballywalter  
 have ancestors who came from England  
 and Scotland. They arrived by boat    
 three to four hundred years ago.      
    First of all they worshipped at a  
 medieval church up the Dunover Road.  
 It was called Whitechurch. This church
 was probably built by the Normans.    
    Then the Presbyterians built their 
 own church. The present one was built 
 in l889 and about 270 families go     
 there. The minister is Dr.A. Russell. 
    The Church of Ireland closed the   
 medieval church about l700. They built
 one at Balligan, about four miles     
 away, but Ballywalter village expanded
 and they built a church at Ballywalter
 in l849. They have about 250 families.
 Their vicar is Rev. D. Hanna.         
    There is also a small Bethel Hall  
 for Brethren people.
