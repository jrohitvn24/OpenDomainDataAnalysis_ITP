		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA.</title>
		<content>                                       
        This semi-rural area lies in   
{Mid-Antrim}halfway between the town of
{Portglenone}on the{River Bann,}to the 
 west, and{Ballymena,}the county town  
 of the area, three miles to the east. 
  It is an area of undulating lowland  
 which slopes gently towards the flood 
 plain of the{River Maine}in the east. 
  The general landscape is one of a    
 patchwork of small fields enclosed by 
 hedges. There is a close network of   
 minor roads and lanes which link the  
 many family run farms.                
  On the main Ballymena to Portglenone 
 road in the north-east is the village 
 of {Ahoghill}which is the main centre 
 of population with a range of small   
 shops. Nearer Ballymena,beside the    
 R.Maine,is the smaller{Gracehill}     
 village with traditional stone houses,
 built 220 years ago by the Moravians. </content>
