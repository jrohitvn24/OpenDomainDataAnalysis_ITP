		<content> Many of the farmers in the area have  
 jobs other than farming e.g. builders,
 drivers, forestry workers, water filt-
 ration plant workers, etc. Most of the
 farmers' wives take an active part in 
 the farming, often in addition to     
 other paid employment which may be    
 seasonal e.g. in local hotels, school 
 meals etc. Most farmers wives would   
 also take charge of hens, lambs, pigs,
 geese etc. Many farmhouses have been  
 sold separately from the farm: many   
 farms have most of the land let as    
 conacre. There are therefore many     
 houses in the area which are now      
 simply dwelling houses instead of part
 of a farm. Most of the newer-looking  
 houses are either old farmhouses which
 have been renovated or houses, usually
 bungalows which have been built as    
 'farmworkers houses' in order to get  
 planning permission.Many are then sold</content>
