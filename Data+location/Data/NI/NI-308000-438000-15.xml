		<content> In our area there is one{Health Centre
 which is divided into two parts, a    
{hospital}and a{clinic.}The Health     
 Centre has two practices made up of   
 five doctors,{Dr.Farnan, Dr.Bell,     
{Dr.Guzhar, Dr.Russell and Dr.McLister.
 The{Dalriada Hospital}has 50 beds,44  
 for general patients and 6 for        
 maternity use.Also they have a new    
 casualty department but to have this  
 they had to get rid of the operating  
 theatre, which was hardly used anyway.
 As well as this the hospital has two  
 ambulances.                           
 At the other end of the town there is 
 a{Dental Surgery}run by two           
 dentists.                             
 Our area is quite bad when it comes to
 stomach upsets. This could be a result
 of chemicals in the drinking water but
 nobody is sure. This causes the Health
 Services to be used often.            </content>
