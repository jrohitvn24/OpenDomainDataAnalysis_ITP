		<title>10SPIRITS OF FATHOM</title>
		<content> Local legend proclaims the presence of
 3 groups of spirits in block 6.  The  
 first consists of a Fairy Glen        
 centred around a stone tower which is 
 now in ruins.  Fairies are reputed to 
 play regularly in the area and local  
 legend maintains that if a person     
 enters the ring and the spell is      
 broken, the fairies will disappear.   
 Therefore people are reluctant to     
 venture within the Glen.  Another     
 legend revolves around a man who      
 committed suicide through hanging     
 himself at the side of the road.  It  
 is alleged that he returns every      
 Halloween night to revisit the place  
 of his death and thus a bonfire is    
 erected annually at the site.  Finally
 the "{Malouise}", a few fields of     
 extremely marshy ground, has claimed  
 the lives of at least 2 human victims 
 whose spirits return to haunt Fathom. </content>
