 THE ONLY REMAINS OF THE DECIDUOUS     
 WOODLAND IS A SMALL AREA NEAR THE     
 SCHOOL.THERE ARE,HOWEVER,TWO AREAS OF 
 MARSHLAND COVERED MAINLY WITH BIRCH   
 TREES.ONE OF THESE IS AN AREA IN      
 BALLYDONAGHY WHICH WAS NOT INCLUDED IN
 THE RECLAMATION AND DRAINAGE SCHEME OF
 THE DENNETT RIVER IN THE 1950'S.THE   
 OTHER IS AN AREA KNOWN AS LOUGH NEAS. 
 EFFORTS WERE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME BY
 LOCAL FARMERS TO RECLAIM IT. THEY HAD 
 THE IDEA OF DRAINING THIS AREA INTO   
 THE DENNETT BUT THEY DISCOVERED THAT  
 THE LAND WAS HIGHER THAN THE RIVER.IT 
 IS NOW COVERED WITH BIRCH,SHRUBS,WEED,
 GRASS,MOSS AND LICHEN.IT HAS IN FACT  
 BECOME A BREEDING GROUND FOR WILDLIFE.
 THERE IS ONE REMNANT OF ANCIENT OAK   
 GROVES AT THE PRESBYTERIAN BRIDGE.IT  
 IS A VERY OLD TREE SAID TO BE HUNDREDS
 OF YEARS OLD.                         </content>
