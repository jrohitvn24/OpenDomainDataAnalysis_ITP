		<content>   There are two main road types in our
 district.One is the main type(one     
 second class the other third class    
                                       
 They are about six metres wide.They   
 stretch from Lurgan to Charlestown    
 via{Ardmore                           
 and Derrytrasna.They are usually named
 for the townlands through which they  
 pass e.g.{ARDMORE ROAD }and{          
{DERRYTRASNA ROAD.}                    
    The others are linking roads.Many  
 of these are called {RAMPARTS}.They   
 were originally tracks through the    
 bogs and so to-day they are noticeably
 higher than the surrounding land.These
 are often named for the person who    
 owned the land or who lived along them
 e.g.{LENNYS ROAD }or for their        
 destination e.g.{PIER RAMPART.}
