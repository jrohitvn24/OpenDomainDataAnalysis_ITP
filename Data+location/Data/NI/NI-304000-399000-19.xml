 most families have finished work and  
 school for the week.                  
  Most{children}use the long summer    
 evenings to play in the gardens or    
 greens in the housing estates.Some go 
 to the playing fields for football,or 
 to the play area with it's slides and 
 swings etc. In the country areas play 
 is seldom in groups but in family     
 groups around the farm.               
{ Adults}either relax watching T.V.or  
 catching up with gardening. The new   
 outdoor bowling green in Ahoghill is  
 crowded most nights being especially  
 popular among the senior citizens.    
  The two{public houses}in Ahoghill are
 busy on Friday and Saturday nights.   
 They have introduced Darts and Pool   
 competitions to encourage people to   
 come in for a drink.Most people's     
 social life is in church activities.  </content>
