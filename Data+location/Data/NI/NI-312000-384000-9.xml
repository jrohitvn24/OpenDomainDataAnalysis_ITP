		<content>   Antrim Primary Schools Swimming Gala
 takes place annually at Antim         
 Forum.About 12 schools take part and  
 there are many different strokes which
 you are allowed to swim,the           
 backstroke,front crawl,and butterfly. 
 To get to the Gala first of all you   
 have to race against people in your   
 own school and the fastest people in  
 each stroke get through.After that you
 race against people from different    
 schools to see if you can get into the
 finals which are held about two days  
 after the semi-finals.You have to be  
 in either P6 or P7 to get into the    
 Gala and each age group have their own
 races.The people who come first in the
 races get medals and the people who   
 come second or third get              
 certificates.The school with the most 
 points gets a silver cup.
