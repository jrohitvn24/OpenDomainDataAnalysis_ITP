		<content> Our milkman goes on his milk round    
 almost everyday of the week. On       
 Wednesdays another man stands in for  
 him so that he can have a day off. He 
 delivers 640 bottles a day,to         
 approximately 470 houses. He has been 
 delivering milk for about thirty      
 years.During this time he has seen    
 many changes.Milk was originally      
 delivered in tin cans and at this time
 our milkman made his deliveries from a
 horse and cart.Cans changed to bottles
 and then to cartons.He covers a large 
 area and in order to get to all his   
 customers he now uses a petrol driven 
 motor van.He has to be up in the      
 morning at four o'clock.It takes him  
 five hours to get round all his       
 customers.He is the second generation 
 of his family to deliver milk.
