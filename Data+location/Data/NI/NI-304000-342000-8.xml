		<title>08SCARVA CANAL</title>
		<content> The Canal which passes by Scarva was  
 the first major inland canal to be    
 completed in the British Isles, it was
 opened in 1742.                       
 It was built to carry coal from the   
 coalfield at Coalisland to Newry from 
 where it was carried by ship to       
 Dublin.                               
 When the Belfast - Dublin Railway Link
 was completed in 1852, it ran parallel
 to the canal.                         
 With coalmining stopping at Coalisland
 and the growing support for rail      
 freight there was a steady decline in 
 the tonnage carried in the late 19th  
 Century and early 20th Century.  In   
 1939 it was decided to abandon the    
 canal.
