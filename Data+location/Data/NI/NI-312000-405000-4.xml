		<title>04ST.PATRICK'S CH. OF IRELAND</title>
		<content>   St. Patrick's Church of Ireland was 
 built by the O'Neills in 1765.In      
 recent years the spire has had to be  
 removed because it was in a dangerous 
 condition.                            
   The congregation consists of 160    
 families and there are services held  
 weekly at 12.00 noon and 6.00 p.m.    
   Many years ago there was a school   
 attached to the church.When education 
 ceased to be carried on there it was  
 used as a church hall.                
   Just a few years ago a beautiful new
 hall was built and is used by many    
 organisations.These include a bowling 
 club,badminton club,youth clubs and a 
 young farmers club.                   
  The present minister of the church is
{Archdeacon Stoney}and he was appointed
 in 1966.                              
   At the entrance to the church is a  
 beautiful Lych Gate.                  </content>
