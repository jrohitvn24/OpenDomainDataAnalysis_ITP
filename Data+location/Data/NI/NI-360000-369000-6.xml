		<title>06 Trade in Ballywalter</title>
		<content>    Trade in Ballywalter has changed an
 awful lot since earlier days.         
 Altogether in Ballywalter now, there  
 are two grocers, one hardware store, a
 post-office and a few smaller shops.  
 The grocers' shops are mostly used by 
 the village people. They usually have 
 to pay more for their groceries       
 because they do not have a car to get 
 to a supermarket in a large town.     
    The builders store sells all things
 from field drains to door handles. It 
 has a big shed behind it full of wood,
 piping, forklifts and big tanks. They 
 also have a yard along the road with  
 sand, cement and bricks in it.        
    There is also quite a big sports   
 shop in Ballywalter which does most of
 its business in the Summer when the   
 visitors come.
