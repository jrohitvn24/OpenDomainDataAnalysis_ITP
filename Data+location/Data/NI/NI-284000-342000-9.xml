		<content>  We interviewed a{Mrs.H.T.Morton}who  
 lives at Ballyhoy, in Milford, which  
 is in our area.                       
  We asked her how long she had  lived 
 in this area. She said that her       
 ancesters had settled in Milford sixty
 years ago in 1925 but she had only    
 been living there for thirty          
 years (1955).                         
  We asked her what her family and     
 herself did for a living and for      
 recreation. She said that she lived on
 a farm where they had milking cows and
 beef cattle. They also grow crops such
 as silage and grass and they also     
 plough the land.                      
  On weekdays it is hardwork, they have
 to feed and milk cows and normal      
 farmwork. On Sundays they have an     
 easier time. In the morning they go   
 to church and when they come home they
 milk the cows and then they rest.     </content>
