		<title>03The Playgroup (1)</title>
		<content>    The{playgroup}was established in   
 1975. It was established by a group of
 young mothers. They tried to find a   
 place in the town and eventually found
 the old school on the outskirts. They 
 thought this would be an excellent    
 place to have a playgroup. It had a   
 large yard, and it had two large rooms
 which would just be big enough for the
 children to play in.                  
    There are about 40 young boys and  
 girls now. This number increases every
 year. There are three mothers to mind 
 the children. The playgroup is        
 financed partly by the Social Services
 and partly by fund raising. There are 
 two large rooms. One has water and    
 sand in it and the other has desks,   
 a doll's house and many different     
 toys.
