		<title>08Housing in Aughnacloy</title>
		<content> Six housing estates provide rented    
 accommodation for 121 families in     
 Aughnacloy.The oldest estate was built
 in{1950.Phrase One}in the seventh     
 estate at{Benburb Road}is now in      
 progress.Most of these houses are     
 terraced or semi-detached.Some are    
 single storey dwellings to suit the   
 needs of the elderly.                 
  Although green fields surround the   
 town,playing areas,either at or near  
 the housing estates,have not been     
 provided.The surrounding countryside  
 is mostly owner_occupied farm houses  
 or more recently,farm bungalows.Silos 
 for holding winter feed for animals,  
 cubicle houses for cattle in winter   
 and a machinery house are the main    
 buildings to be found in most         
 farmyards.
