		<content> A graphic designer meets lots of      
 people and has a hard job. He usually 
 works nine hours a day but sometimes  
 longer. My uncle is a graphic designer
 for Ulster Television. He became a    
 graphic designer when he was 27. He   
 has another job but he says the wages 
 are better in the designer job. There 
 is quite a lot of travelling in this  
 job. As a graphic designer he designs 
 score boards for sports programmes and
 flashes up the numbers for electric   
 score boards. Graphic designers design
 the colours for for the names of      
 programmes and put them on the wall at
 the back of the studio.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
