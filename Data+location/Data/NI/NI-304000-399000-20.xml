		<content>{ Saturday activities}for many families
 starts with a journey into Ballymena, 
 4 miles away to shop (especially in   
 the new Tower Shopping Centre) or to  
 brouse around the famous Fair Hill,   
 open air market.                      
  Appart from bowls at Ahoghill there  
 is little{summer sport on Saturdays.  
 Those who play or watch Tennis or     
 Cricket have to go to the two clubs in
 Ballymena. Good weather sees an exodus
 to the{Co. Antrim seaside}(Portrush   
 and Cushendall are the most popular.) 
{ Sundays}are still very special in    
 this predominantly protestant area.   
{ Churches}are very well attended and  
 during the rest of the day few shops  
 are open and no organised social or   
 sporting activities are held.         
 The T.V. is popular, as are family    
 outings in the car or walks in the    
 country.Sunday schools are common.    </content>
