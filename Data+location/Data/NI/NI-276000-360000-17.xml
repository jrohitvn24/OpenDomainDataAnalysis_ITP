		<content> They are then taken by van to         
 Aldergrove Airport and flown to       
 various regional airports in Britain. 
 From the airports they are put on mail
 trains on which they are sorted by    
 hand into sacks for different towns.  
 These sacks are hung from the side of 
 the train when arriving at the various
 towns. They are caught by a device on 
 the platform and then the bags are    
 taken to the local post office for    
 sorting and delivery. It is estimated 
 that a letter travelling from         
 Dungannon to a city like Birmingham   
 may pass through as many as one       
 hundred pairs of hands before reaching
 its destination.  In the Dungannon    
 area most deliveries are made by van. 
 There are only five delivery routes on
 foot and one by bicycle. Every postman
  must have a driving licence before he
 can be employed.                      </content>
