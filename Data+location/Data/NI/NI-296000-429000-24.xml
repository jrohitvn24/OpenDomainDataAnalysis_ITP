Much of the land around Dervock is farmland.  Crops such as barley, maize and potatoes are grown.  Many fields produce silage for cattle in the winter.  In the past, farmers had small herds of cows but now they have herds of over a hundred.  Many farmers’ milking parlours are computerised.  Field sizes are much bigger than they used to be.  As a result of this, machinery is bigger and more powerful.  This is a great help to the farmers.  Farmers around Dervock take their animals to either Armoy or Ballymena markets because the one in Ballymoney closed down recently.  The barley is taken to Chestnutts’ Mill in Stranocum, where it is added to animal feed and eventually delivered to local farms.  Some of the potatoes grown are sold by the farmer from his farm, others are sold in the shops and some are sent for export to Eastern Europe.  Slurry for fertilizing the fields is now stored in tanks rather than pits and can only be spread at certain times of the year.   &lt;br />
