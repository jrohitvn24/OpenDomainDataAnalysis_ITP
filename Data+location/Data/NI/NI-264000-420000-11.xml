		<title>11A DAY AT SCHOOL part1</title>
		<content>                                       
    My mother calls me at about 7.30   
and if I am feeling well slept I am    
usually up and dressed in 15 minutes.  
For breakfast I usually eat some cereal
with milk and then a slice of toast.   
    I catch the bus at 8.15 and along  
with about forty or fifty others we    
have a twenty minute journey to school.
It is not too noisy at this time, most 
of us are not yet awake.               
   School begins at 9.00 with roll call
in our form-teacher's room. At 9.15 we 
go to our first class. There are six   
classes per day, four before lunch and 
two after.                             
   I am in third year in a secondary   
school and we study 11 subjects each   
with a different teacher.              
   Next year we begin our "O" level    
courses and I will have to select four 
subjects from about 15 to study.       </content>
