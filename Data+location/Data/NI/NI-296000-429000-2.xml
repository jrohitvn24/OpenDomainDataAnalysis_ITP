		<content> The block is covered by one doctor    
 who has his surgery in the village of 
{DERVOCK.}There are about 2630 patients
 in this practice. It is a single-     
 handed{dispensing}practice and most   
 medicines are dispensed in the surgery
 by the doctor.                        
                                       
 He sees about 40 patients in the      
 surgery and makes about 5 house calls 
 per day and 6 night calls in a month. 
 He has a rota with another Doctor in  
 the area so that he has some weekends 
 free.                                 
                                       
 Most maternity cases are delivered by 
 the Doctor in the{Robinson Memorial   
{Hospital, Ballymoney.}Those with      
 complications are sent to the{Route   
{Hospital,}as they have better         
 facilities for operations.
