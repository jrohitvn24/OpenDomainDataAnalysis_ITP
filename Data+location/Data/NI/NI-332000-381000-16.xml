		<content>     We did a survey of playground     
 games and the three most popular were 
 football,marbles and skipping.        
     The rules for football are just   
 the same but we uncovered many ways to
 skip or play marbles.                 
{MARBLES}                              
     We found that different types of  
 marbles all have different names and  
 some are very odd such as,{Dog's Eyes,
{Bloodsuckers , Smokys ,}or{Oilers.    
     Each group playing seemed to have 
 their own rules such as,{Tips,Guns,   
{Flicks,Corners}and it was very noisy. 
{SKIPPING                              
     Mostly girls skipped and we got   
 nearly 50 different rhymes one lunch  
 hour. Here's just one.                
    {Silence in the courtyard,         
    {Silence in the street.            
{    The biggest fool in Ireland,      
    {Is just about to speak.           </content>
