		<content> Soil leaching, simple ageing of the   
 plant communities and stabilising of  
 the sand surface have led to the      
 reduction in the pioneer plants and   
 others typical of the coastal dunes.  
 As the Reserve is managed as a Sand   
 Dune System, it may be necessary in   
 the near future to 'damage' some areas
 in order to encourage these plants and
 maintain the youthful end of the      
 succession. This year has seen the    
 start of a program to introduce more  
 rabbits in an attempt to encourage the
 plant communities characterised by    
 short rabbit-cropped turf. The extent 
 to which the indigenous fox population
 will allow this, is still to be seen! 
 Most of the spread of Sea Buckthorn   
 can be related to the decline in the  
 rabbit population as a result of      
 Myxomatosis. The rabbits seem to be   
 increasingly immune to this disease.  </content>
