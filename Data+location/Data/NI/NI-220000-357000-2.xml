		<title>02Necarne Estate:JENNIFER</title>
		<content>{Necarne Castle}stands at the heart of 
{Castle Irvine Demesne}and is now in a 
 state of dilapidation. Legend has it  
 that{Hugh Roe O'Donnell}on one of his 
 marches noticed,as he thought,a fort  
 and ordered soldiers to investigate.  
 They returned to say{'Ni Carn e'}or   
 there is no building. From{1667}the   
 estate belonged to the Irvine family  
 and a visit today reveals evidence of 
 a once flourishing and stylish way of 
 life. We walked through the pleasure  
 ground with its paths among shrubs and
 trees now overgrown. A gate opened to 
 the walled gardens which once produced
 vegetables and fruit but now are used 
 to rear pheasants for winter shoots.  
 We moved on to the farmyard with its  
 buildings round two large courtyards. 
 Then we went to see the byres, stables
 and stores and they are now like the  
 castle unoccupied and unused.         </content>
