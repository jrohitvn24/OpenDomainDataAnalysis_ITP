		<title>19The Ulster Drama Festival</title>
		<content> The Larne Festival is part of the     
 Association of Ulster Drama Festvals  
 which organises the Ulster Festival   
 each year. This is currently held in  
 the Grand Opera House in Belfast and  
 the top six drama companies are       
 invited to take part in a week of     
 Amateur Theatre.                      
 The 1985 Festival was held in May,    
 with Welshman Raymond Edwards         
 adjudiucating. Larne Drama Circle won 
 the Festival with 'Tea In A China     
 Cup'.                                 
 This year the Association hosted the  
 British One Act Final Festival, for   
 the first time since 1968. Members of 
 the Larne Committee were responsible  
 for arranging the Final, which was    
 held in the Riverside Theatre in      
 Coleraine. The winning play came from 
 the Riverside Players of Merseyside.
