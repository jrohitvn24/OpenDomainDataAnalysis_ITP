 There are many ancient sites,known as 
{Raths}found in this block.These{Raths,
 built by Celtic peoples were fortified
 farmsteads and consisted of circular  
 mounds,palisaded &amp; surrounded by      
 ditches.On our area map there are ten 
 such sites marked .                   
   An other Historic feature in our    
 block is the site of{Muckamore Abbey }
 which was built in the 6th century 100
 metres from the Six-mile Water river. 
 The abbey became very important and   
 was destroyed and rebuilt atleast     
 twice. The abbey declined but its     
 importance is reflected in {place     
{names }of the area.
