		<content> In{EGGY}you have 3 lives.  The person 
 who is on throws up the ball and      
 shouts somebody's name.  He has to try
 and catch the ball. If he catches it  
 he has to throw it up quickly and call
 someone else's name.  If that person  
 does not catch the ball he has to get 
 it while the other people run away.   
 When he gets the ball he shouts "Eggy"
 and everyone has to stand still. The  
 person who is on tries to hit someone 
 with the ball.  If you're hit, you're 
 on, but if not he keeps on trying     
 until his 3 lives are used up.        
 In{GERMAN JUMPS}you join elastic bands
 together, and 2 people stand 2 metres 
 apart facing each other, with the long
 loop of elastic around their ankles.  
 The others line up. The leader does   
 things on the elastic like stepping on
 it and those behind have to copy it.
