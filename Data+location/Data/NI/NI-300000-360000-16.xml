		<title>16PLAYGROUND GAMES</title>
		<content>    DURING free time in school we like 
 to play {FOOTBALL,ROUNDERS,HOPSCOTCH  
{and BALL TIG.}We also like to play on 
 the swings and the sand-pit. During   
 the summer term some boys bring Tonka 
 Toys and play silage making and other 
 pretend farm games with diggers,      
 tractors,forklifts and lorries.       
    When it is too wet to play outside 
 we play board games such as {         
{LUDO,CHESS,DRAUGHTS,SCRABBLE,TRIMATICS
{and VARIOUS CARD and DOMINO GAMES.}We 
 also enjoy making jigsaws of countries
 of the world.                         
    Most of us go to{ARDMORE YOUTH CLUB
  and a children's meeting at{ARDMORE  
{GOSPEL HALL.}Some of us have gardens  
 of our own,one goes pony-trekking,many
 boys go fishing and all like riding   
 their bikes and having best friends to
 stay.
