		<content> This area is sparsley populated,      
 except for the south-eastern corner,  
 which borders the town of{Randalstown.
                                       
 The map of the area is out of date    
 and there are at least seven new      
 bungalows built on Church Road and    
 Clonkeen Road.                        
                                       
 There has also been a large           
 development of{private bungalows}just 
 outside Randalstown, on the Church    
 Road, opposite Grant Avenue.          
                                       
 Tresna Park is also a relativly new   
 development by the{Housing Executive}.
 It is a continuation of the           
 Neillsbrook Estate. The rest of the   
 housing in the area around Randalstown
 which is in this section has been     
 erected for some years.
