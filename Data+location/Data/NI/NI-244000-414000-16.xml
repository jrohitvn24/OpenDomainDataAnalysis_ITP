		<content> My hobby is swimming.I  have the      
 choice of two pools, the {LISNAGELVIN 
{POOL} near my school or the one at {  
{TEMPLEMORE SPORTS COMPLEX.}I go       
 swimming every Tuesday and Thursday.I 
 can do four different strokes, the    
 breast_stroke,the back-stroke,the     
 front_crawl and the butterfly.Also I  
 have just learned to dive. I like to  
 swim in deep water. At present I am   
 practising for my twenty_five metre   
 badge.I enjoy going to the pool with  
 my friends because we can play        
 different games.The pool is designed  
 like a kidney_shape,there is a steep  
 slide which spirals down into the     
 water.This is fixed to the bottom  of 
 the pool in the shallow end.A special 
 feature which this pool has is a {    
{wave_making machine.}The sound of a   
 horn tells us that the machine has    
 been turned on.                       </content>
