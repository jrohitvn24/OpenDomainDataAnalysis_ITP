		<title>11Tourism in Dungiven</title>
		<content> Dungiven's main tourist attraction is 
 its scenic beauty.It nestles in the   
 valley of the River Roe and is almost 
 completely surrounded by mountains.   
 There is a road which climbs to the   
 top of Benbradagh mountain giving a   
 panoramic view of the Roe valley. This
 road is part of the Ulster Way _a     
 footpath for ramblers encircling the  
 whole of Ulster.The River Roe is an   
 attraction to anglers and has a       
 reputation for being a good salmon and
 sea_trout source.Dungiven is of great 
 interest to the tourist from a        
 historical point of view .The castle  
 was built in 1839 though parts of the 
 walls date back to 1617.There is an   
 Augustinian priory dating back to 1100
 A.D.The priory contains an ornate tomb
 reputed to be that of Cooey_na_Gall   
 O'Cahan who died in 1385.
