		<title>03A SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> I GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING, WASH   
 AND DRESS. FOR MY BREAKFAST  I HAVE   
 CEREAL, TEA AND TOAST. I HAVE TO EAT  
 QUICKLY BECAUSE I HAVE TO CATCH THE   
 8.55 BUS TO SCHOOL.                   
                                       
 WE HAVE A MILK BREAK AT 11 O'CLOCK AND
 OUR LUNCH BREAK AT 12.30. THERE ARE NO
 SCHOOL DINNERS SO WE BRING SANDWICHES 
 FOR OUR LUNCH. WE GET OUT OF SCHOOL AT
 3 O'CLOCK, AND MY MOTHER COLLECTS ME  
 IN THE CAR.                           
                                       
 WHEN I GET HOME I GET MY DINNER OF    
 POTATOES, MEAT AND VEGETABLES. THEN I 
 DO MY HOMEWORK AND PLAY OUTSIDE IF IT 
 IS A GOOD DAY. IF IT IS WET I WATCH   
 TELEVISION OR PLAY WITH MY TOYS.      
                                       
 AFTER TEA ALL THE FAMILY WATCH        
 TELEVISION. I GO TO BED AT 9.30 SINCE 
 I HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY.  </content>
