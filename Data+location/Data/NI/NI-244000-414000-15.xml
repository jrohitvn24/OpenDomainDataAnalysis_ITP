		<content> The {LISNAGELVIN LEISURE CENTRE}was   
 opened on the 19th March 1980 by      
 Londonderry's Mayor Mr.P.Devine.The   
 centre was built in the area because  
 of a previous lack of leisure         
 facilities.The total cost in the      
 building of the centre was Â£1,250,000 
 and it took two and a half years to   
 build.Twenty-four people are employed 
 there and the facilities on offer to  
 the public are a free-formed{pool}    
 which has a{wave-maker}and a{         
{helter-skelter,}a{sun-bed room,}a{    
{creche}and a{fitness room.}The centre 
 also provides for outdoor activities  
 in that it has{soccer}and{cricket}    
 pitches plus a{bowling-green.}In an   
 average week three thousand people use
 the pool and during the summer months 
 this number rises to four and a half  
 thousand. The pool can hold 120,000   
 gallons of water which is recycled.   </content>
