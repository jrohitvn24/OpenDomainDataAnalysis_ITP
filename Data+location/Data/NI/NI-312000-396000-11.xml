		<title>11My Mum In Town</title>
		<content> Every Saturday morning when my mum    
 gets up she goes to the town to       
 get things. Then she goes visiting    
 when she comes home from the town.She 
 usually goes to my grannys house first
 then she goes to my aunts.I enjoy     
 going to the town but going to my     
 granny or my aunt is boring.Each      
 Saturday my mum would buy groceries   
 vegetables, fruit, and occasionally   
 clothes for the family. The fruit she 
 buys would include apples, pears,     
 oranges, bananas, and sometimes kiwi  
 fruit.The vegetables she buys would   
 include potatoes, lettuces, and       
 cabbages.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
