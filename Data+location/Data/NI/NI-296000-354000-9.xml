		<title>09FARMING</title>
		<content>   This is an area of mixed farming-{  
{dairy}farming,{beef}production,{stock}
 rearing,{arable}farming,{hay}and {    
{silage}making _ as well as {apple}    
 producing,and all farmers are involved
 in several of these aspects.          
   The rich green pasture is well      
 suited to {cattle}and everywhere there
 are herds.First there are the {dairy} 
 herds-mainly Friesian. The cows are   
 milked by machine night and morning,  
 and the milk is cooled and stored in  
 large containers. These are emptied by
 milk tankers which deliver the milk to
 a convenient Creamery,and here milk   
 products - butter,cheese, yoghurt and 
 by-products are made. Also here much  
 of the milk is pasteurised,bottled or 
 put in cartons to be delivered daily  
 by lorry to individual households over
 the entire area _ urban and rural.
