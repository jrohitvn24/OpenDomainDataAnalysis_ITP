		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The area is situated about half       
 way between Belfast and Lisburn on the
 main Belfast to Dublin and Belfast and
 the West route. It is divided by the  
 M1 motorway. To the East is the mainly
 recreational land including two golf  
 courses, the Mary Peters athletic     
 track and some of Belfast's most      
 beautiful parkland. West of the       
 motorway is Dunmurry, the main        
 shopping and population centre. Here  
 also are large areas of post-war      
 housing estate developments. Two of   
 these, Twinbrook and Seymour Hill are 
 very large and have polarised into    
 Republican and Unionist estates. Forty
 years ago this was an area of         
 scattered villages but it has now     
 become an amorphous extension of      
 Belfast, the old centres having less  
 meaning. Dunmurry Industrial Estate is
 a recent and important development.   </content>
