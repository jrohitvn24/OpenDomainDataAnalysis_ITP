{1985,for my breakfast,I had toast,    
{buns and tea. I watched cartoons on   
{television.After I washed and         
{dressed,I went out shopping.For my    
{dinner that day I had ham sandwiches  
{and a bowl of tomato soup. After      
{helping my mum to wash the dishes,I   
{played with Nell and Janette my two   
{friends. We played Two                
{Balls,Donkey,Sindy Dolls and football.
{I was called in for my tea. That      
{evening my dad made us a curry. Later 
{that evening I watched some           
{television. I watched the Hunter and  
{The Price is Right.I had a bath and   
{went up to my nanny's house. Istated  
{there for the night. She gave me a    
{packet of crisps and a glass of milk  
{and then I went to my bed to read. }
