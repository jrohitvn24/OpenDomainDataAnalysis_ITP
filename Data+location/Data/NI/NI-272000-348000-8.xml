		<content>    As our area is rural there is      
 an abundance of flora and fauna. The  
 common trees are oak, ash, sycamore,  
 chestnut and elm. Perhaps the most    
 common is the sycamore. We planted    
 some acorns earlier in the year and we
 have three flourishing oak trees.     
 Common wild flowers are daisies,      
 buttercups, dandelions, violets,      
 ladies smock, bluebells, wood anemone 
 and cow parsley is beginning to grow  
 in profusion. As there is little or no
 air pollution plants and trees appear 
 to flourish in our area.              
    We have a wide selection of birds. 
 There are several rookeries in the    
 area, each with a large population of 
 crows. We also have thrushes,         
 blackbirds(a young family of these are
 in our school shelter) robins,        
 bullfinches,sparrows, blue tits,      
 pigeons and pheasants.                </content>
