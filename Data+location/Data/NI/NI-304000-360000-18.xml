		<title>18Motorway Bridge,Lurgan</title>
		<content>  There are four bridges over the      
 Motorway which runs through the area. 
 These bridges are the Mile House      
 Bridge, Green Lane Bridge,the Motorway
 Bridge and Boconnell Bridge.The main  
 roads into the town of Lurgan from the
 Motorway are connected to the         
 Industrial Estate and to the new City 
 of Craigavon.                         
  There is also a network of country   
 roads which are very narrow because   
 they do not have a great volume of    
 traffic on them.                      
  Taxi firms have recently flourished  
 in the area.Buses run to outlying     
 areas,mainly at peak times.           
  The Motorway connects the town to    
 Belfast and to the west of the        
 Country.Many of the residents of the  
 area work in Belfast and they share   
 transport with fellow-travellers.
