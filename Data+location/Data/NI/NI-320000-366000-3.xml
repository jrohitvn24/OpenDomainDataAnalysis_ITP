		<content>{FARMING.                              
 This is the main feature of the       
 area and it is almost entirely pasture
 farming carried out in small fields.  
 It involves mostly beef cattle and    
 some dairy herds. During the survey no
 sheep were seen although several      
 fields contained one or two horses.   
{INDUSTRY}There is little industry in  
 the area except  for the Trevor Jordan
 Concrete Works on Sheepwalk Road and  
 the nearby Kings and Co. and White    
 Mountain Stone Quarries. The quarries 
 cover almost 0.5 sq.km. of land and   
 the stones extracted are graded for   
 use in making roads, pavements, tarmac
 etc.{TOURISM}Belshaw's Quarry is the  
 only tourist attraction in the area it
 is a disused limestone quarry between 
 Rathlin and White Mountain, it is now 
 a Nature Reserve owned by the         
 Department of the Enviroment.         </content>
