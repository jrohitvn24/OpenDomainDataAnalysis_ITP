		<content> Boys in our block are very fashionable
 wearing baggy clothes such as trousers
 at about Â£13 and shirts which are     
 about Â£9. These trousers and shirts   
 are called baggy because they are     
 loose_fitting.                        
                                       
 Girls generally wear loose fitting    
 clothes too. Their jumpers are called 
 bat_wing because they are shaped like 
 a bats wing under the arm and would   
 cost about Â£7.                        
                                       
 Babies clothes are very expensive. A  
 little dress would cost about Â£15, a  
 coat Â£30.                             
                                       
 Nowadays we have a punk trend although
 in our area the punks are very much in
 the minority. The punks wear gaudy    
 clothes and often spike and dye their 
 hair, purple, pink or even blue.      </content>
