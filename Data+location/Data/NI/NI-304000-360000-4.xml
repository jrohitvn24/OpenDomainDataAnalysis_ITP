		<title>04Lough Neagh Sailing Club</title>
		<content>  Lough Neagh Sailing Club was founded 
 about 1880.Since that time it has been
 disbanded and reformed on quite a few 
 occasions.The last time it was        
 reformed was in 1960.Since then it has
 moved to various sites in the area,   
 until settling in its present         
 Clubhouse in 1970.                    
  The club has 263 members.The         
 membership reached a peak of 600      
 members in 1975,but has lost many     
 since that time.Those having large    
 boats find the facilities and space   
 available at sea venues are better    
 than at Lough Neagh and have moved    
 there.The cost of maintenance is      
 becoming prohibitive.Annual insurance 
 can cost Â£250.                        
  The annual membership fee is Â£60 for 
 a full member.The future of the club  
 is uncertain as the membership is     
 falling and the cost of upkeep rising.</content>
