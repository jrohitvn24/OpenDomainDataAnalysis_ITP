		<title>08TOUR OF FLORENCECOURT HOUSE</title>
		<content>{Florencecourt House}was built around  
 1740 for the{Cole}family.The wings and
 the pavilions were added to either    
 side of the central block by{William  
{Willoughby Cole,First Earl of         
{Enniskillen}who inherited in 1767.The 
{5th Earl}and his son{Michael}gave the 
 estate to{The National Trust}in{1953. 
{The Hall:}The frieze around it is the 
 original but the ceiling has been     
 replaced because in 1955 parts of the 
 House were destroyed by{fire.         
 .The fire place is Donegal sandstone. 
 The{fire back}dates from 1588. It came
 from Devon,the original home of the   
 Coles. The National Trust removed the 
 partion which was added in the early  
 part of this century.The picture above
 the fire place is of Galbraith Lowry  
 Cole.There are 4 doors,2 of which are 
 dummy doors.One leads to an office and
 the other to the{Library.}            </content>
