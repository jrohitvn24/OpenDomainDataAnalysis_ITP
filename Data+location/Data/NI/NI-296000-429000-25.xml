<title>25Potato Store</title>
<content>

The Fane Valley Potato Factory in the village closed down 2 years ago.  It employed around 20 local people.  Farmers in the district used to bring their potatoes to the store where they were sorted, bagged and then delivered to shops all over Northern Ireland.  Some were even exported.  The closure of the store meant that jobs were lost and the farmers had to find different ways to sell their potatoes.  The people in the village also miss the store because they were used going to there to buy ‘their spuds’.   &lt;br />
