 At present the factory is split       
 between two different sites. The      
 blowing shop, which is in our area of 
 study, is housed in the original      
 factory. As the company expanded the  
 cutting and designing shop was moved  
 to a vacant factory which is in an    
 adjacent block. This is an            
 unsatisfactory situation as the blown 
 glass has to be transported by van to 
 be cut, designed and finished on the  
 other site. Within the next two years 
 the company hopes to move to a new    
 site housing both parts of the        
 manufacturing operation. It is also   
 hoped, on moving, to expand the       
 workforce to two hundred people.
