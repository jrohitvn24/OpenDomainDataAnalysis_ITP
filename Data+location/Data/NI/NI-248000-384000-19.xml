 are called Dr.V.Singh and Dr. Muldoon.
 They are partners. There is a surgery 
 in Gortin beside Dr. Mulldoon's house,
 It is open a few hours every day. For 
 half of the day Dr. Singh is in the   
 surgery and the other half Dr.        
 Mulldoon.While they are not in the    
 surgery they are out on calls.        
   Whenever they do not have the exact 
 medicine they write a persciption and 
 give it to the patient.The patient    
 takes it to the pharmacy and gets the 
 medicine he needs.Whenever the        
 patient has got a heart attack,cancer 
 or something serious an ambulance is  
 called and the patient is rushed to   
 the County Hospital.The hospital is in
 Omagh. It would take about twenty     
 minutes to get to the county hospital 
 in Omagh in an ambulance.
