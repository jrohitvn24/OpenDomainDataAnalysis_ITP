  The{FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH}in     
 IRELAND was built in 1613. Although   
 now in ruins many visitors come to    
 see, not only the site, but the       
 surrounding graveyard in which there  
 are many interesting headstones. The  
 most famous of these is a memorial to 
 the local weaver poet{JAMES ORR}who   
 died in 1816.                         
                                       
{REDHALL:_}The present house was       
 rebuilt in the 17th century.          
 Occasionally the house is open to the 
 public so that the JACOBEAN CEILINGS  
 may be seen.                          
 During the 2nd World War it was used  
 as a military camp and today is still 
 used for army manoeuvres.             
 Most visitors hope to see the friendly
 ghost known as 'The White Lady'.
