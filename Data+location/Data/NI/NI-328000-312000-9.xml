		<title>09Role of Chairman</title>
		<content> IN HIS THIRD YEAR AS CHAIRMAN OF THE  
 FESTIVAL COMMITTEE.  HE ENJOYS THIS   
 WORK TREMENDOUSLY AND SEES HIS ROLE AS
 THAT OF CO ORDINATOR, ENCOURAGING     
 PEOPLE TO ATTEND MEETINGS AND         
 PERSONALLY SUPPORTING AS MANY OF THE  
 EVENTS AS POSSIBLE.  MR CHARLETON     
 CREDITS THE SUCCESS OF RECENT YEARS   
 TO A COMBINATION OF THINGS - THE HARD 
 WORK OF THE SECRETARY MRS. GRANT, THE 
 MONTHS OF ORGANISATION , AND THE VERY 
 GOOD WEATHER ENJOYED DURING THE LAST  
 TWO SUMMERS.  THE ONE EVENT WHICH HE  
 THINKS IS MOST POPULAR IS THE TALENT  
 CONTEST.  MANY PEOPLE TAKE PART AND   
 THERE IS ALWAYS A LARGE CROWD OF      
 SPECTATORS TO ENCOURAGE THE           
 CONTESTANTS.  AS TO THE FUTURE, MR    
 CHARLETON WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE      
 INVOLVEMENT FROM BUSINESSES AND MORE  
 PEOPLE COMING FORWARD WITH IDEAS TO   
 ASSIST THE COMMITTEE.                 </content>
