 In one such attack nearly half of     
 the bus fleet in Dungannon was        
 destroyed. It costs approximately     
 Â£50,000 to replace each bus that      
 is destroyed. One driver, from the    
 Dungannon depot, was shot dead while  
 driving school children home.         
 Dungannon is linked to the cities of  
 Belfast, Derry and Dublin by an       
 express bus system. An express bus    
 stops at only a limited number of     
 places on route and usually keeps to  
 schedule. Approximately seven hundred 
 and fifty passengers take express     
 buses from Dungannon each day.It is   
 not possible to give an exact         
 breakdown of the cost of travelling by
 bus. The general rule appears to be   
 the longer the journey the cheaper it 
 is per mile ( or per kilometre ).
