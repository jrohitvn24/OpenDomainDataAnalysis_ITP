		<content> The most popular of the mothers'      
 pastimes was Keep Fit. Reasons ranged 
 from losing weight to keeping in      
 shape. Others liked to read or watch  
 soap operas to help relax. Baking for 
 fetes was also popular followed by    
 knitting and sewing,walking and       
 swimming. Some mums preferred         
 Ballymoney to Coleraine pool as they  
 felt children would be safer in their 
 own pool.                             
   The most popular of the dads'       
 pastimes was golf played at           
 Portstewart,Portrush or Castlerock.   
 Jogging came next followed by         
 bowling,computers,reading,photography 
 and D.I.Y.                            
   Together parents liked to listen to 
 music,garden,dine out or go to the    
 theatre. A number were leaders  of    
 youth organisations.
