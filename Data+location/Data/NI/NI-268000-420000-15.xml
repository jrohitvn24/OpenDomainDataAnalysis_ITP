		<title>15THE BANSHEE</title>
		<content> The banshee looks like a little old   
 woman with a kind of halo around her  
 head, and she carries a lamp.  She    
 is able to move through walls and     
 doors like a ghost.My daddy has been  
 to the banshee's nest, and when he was
 there he took a photograph of it.     
 It's like a great big stone with a    
 hole in it that you can look through, 
 and surrounded with long grass.  The  
 banshee's dinner are the stones around
 her nest but you must not interfere   
 with them. My granny says that if you 
 do there will be trouble.  If you hear
 her howling at night or see her it    
 means that someone in your family is  
 going to die.  Many people do not     
 believe, but she's still there. My    
 friend Karen heard the banshee's      
 crying and shortly afterwards her     
 granny died.
