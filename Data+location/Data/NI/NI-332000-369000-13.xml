		<content>     Most people we interviewed lived  
 within half a mile of the shops, they 
 shopped there everyday. We found that 
 most money is spent on meat and meat  
 products per week and the least money 
 is spent on fresh fruit and           
 vegetables. Doctors in recent years,  
 have brought the problem of unhealthy 
 eating to our notice. They recommended
 a{low fat, high fibre diet}. Our      
 survey has shown that the majority of 
 people in our area eat more{white}than
{Wholemeal}bread but most have         
 decreased the amount of fat in their  
 diet and are including a greater      
 proportion of fresh fruit and         
 vegetables. The main advantage of     
 shopping locally was the convenience  
 of being close to work or home. The   
 main disadvantage was that it was too 
 expensive in these shops.
