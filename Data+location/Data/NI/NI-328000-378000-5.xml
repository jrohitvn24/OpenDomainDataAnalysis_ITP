		<content>  Housing within the area is           
 predominantly owner-occupied, though  
 there is a small development of       
 "Housing Executive"{(council-type)    
 houses at Ligoniel. There are two main
 concentrations of{owner-occupied      
{houses}in the area 1. At Ligoniel and 
 2. At Ballysillan, where a new        
 development of 'semis' are currently  
 being built beside the existing       
 housing at Kilcoole and Mountcoole.   
  The other owner-occupied houses are  
 spread very widely throughout the area
 with most of these houses sited on    
 land at least 2 acres in area and many
 of which are{farm dwellings.
