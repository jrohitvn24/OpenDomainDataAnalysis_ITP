 Industry in our area is concentrated  
 on the eastern side of our block and  
 is centred in Gortrush Industrial     
 Estate and Nestles (the largest single
 industrial employer in the area).     
 Nestles is situated on the Derry Road 
 and has a working staff of 170 people.
 Nestles was opened in 1942 and since  
 then its machinery has advanced       
 greatly. About the year 1980 Nestles  
 built a large extension. Their site   
 was chosen because it offered a good  
 supply of milk and a versatile and    
 able labour supply. Coupled with this 
 the site affords easy communication   
 with the main ports Derry and Belfast.
 This was a very important factor in   
 that the factory sends a lot of their 
 powdered milk to South East Asia, the 
 Middle East and South America.        </content>
