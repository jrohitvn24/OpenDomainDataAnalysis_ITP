One of Limavady's main tourist         
attractions is the Roe Valley Country  
Park. This is famous not only for its  
natural beauty but because it contains 
so much of Limavady's history from     
earliest times.                        
   The park contains the site of       
O'Cahan's Castle and the spot where the
famous "leap of the dog" gave rise to  
the name Limavady.(See pages 2,3)      
   This was the site of the first      
electricity generating station to      
supply electricity to the expanding    
Limavady New Town.                     
   The restored buildings alongside the
1896 power house and the new visitors' 
centre with its many exhibitions       
provide interest to the many visitors  
also attracted by the riverside and    
woodland walks.                        
                                       </content>
