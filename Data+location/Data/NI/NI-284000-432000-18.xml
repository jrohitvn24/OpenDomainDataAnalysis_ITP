		<content> In an attempt to gather information on
 the feelings and aspirations of people
 in the catchment of Ballysally Primary
 School,which is predominantly a public
 housing area with a little private    
 housing,50 people chosen at random    
 were asked to complete a questionnaire
 Six areas were selected for inquiry   
 and from the replies the following    
 observations were made.{Shopping}80%  
 equally supported local shops and     
 larger supermarkets,but 50% expressed 
 dissatisfaction with the choice at    
 local shops. A hypermarket would be   
 welcomed by all.{EDUCATION.}Most of   
 those interviewed were satisfied with 
 the choice of primary and secondary   
 schools in the area,but a minority    
 felt dissatisfaction with transport   
 service to secondary schools.The need 
 for corporal punishment in schools was
 expressed by the majority.            </content>
