		<content>  My name is{Sharon}Browne,I live on a 
{farm}with my{mother}and{father}and    
 three{sisters.                        
  I have some{hens}and one{rooster,}we 
 also have a few{cats,kittens}and      
 two{dogs.                             
  When my{granda}was able to shoe a    
 horse,he became a blacksmith.He only  
 worked part time,so he only shod      
 about four or five{horses}a day.      
{Farmers}who brought the{horses}helped 
 him keep them  steady if they were    
 giving trouble.He had two{horses}of   
 his own so he was able to shoe his own
 horses.People had to pay 10 shillings 
 which is now 50p to get their horse   
 shod.He shod the horses in a shed in  
 the backyard,which is now used for    
 sick cows and calves.                 
  Granda is now working on our farm and
 he says he'd far rather work on a farm
 than be a blacksmith.                 </content>
