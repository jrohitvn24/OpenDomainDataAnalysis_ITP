		<title>05A DAY IN THE LIFE</title>
		<content>  Hello!I'm Karen.I'm nine years old   
 and I'm in Primary 5.My days at school
 start at around 9.00 am and finish at 
 3.00 pm.Most days are a mixture of    
 things I love to do and some things   
 I'd rather not.If I could chose my    
 favourite activites for a day at      
 school this is what they would be:    
  Music:Many of us play the recorder.My
 favourite song is the Skye Boat Song.I
 also like P.E and Swimming.Every week 
 we go to the Antrim Forum by bus.My   
 favourite game is Knock_Out.          
  In Needlework I am now making my     
 fabric picture for the Antrim         
 Agricultural Show in July.In the      
 summer term we sometimes help to look 
 after the garden at the front of our  
 school.I hope Loanends is still here  
 in 2085,along with our lovely garden.
