		<title>18GAMES PLAYED AT BUSHMILLS</title>
		<content>    At school we play badminton,       
 football and hockey.                  
   {Badminton}is played with two or    
 four players.  One against one or two 
 against two.  The game is played on a 
 court with a net across the middle.   
 The players hit a shuttlecock with    
 racquets, trying to get the           
 shuttlecock to land on their          
 opponents' court.                     
   {Football}has two teams of eleven   
 players on a grass pitch.  Each has   
 goals and the players try and kick a  
 football into their opponent's goal.  
   {Hockey}has two teams of eleven     
 players as well but the ball is a     
 small hard ball which is passed on a  
 pitch by being hit with a stick.
