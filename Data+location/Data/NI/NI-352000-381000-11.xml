		<title>11HOUSING IN EAST BANGOR</title>
		<content>   The housing in the Eastern part of  
 Bangor is mainly owner-occupied.There 
 is a small public housing estate known
 as the Churchill Estate in Ballyholme 
 and a slightly larger one in          
 Groomsport                            
     In the coastal area of Ballyholme 
 and Groomsport houses are generally   
 older.Some of these have recently been
 modernised with the help of grants    
     Newer housing has grown up in the 
 past 15 years at a very fast rate and 
 is a mixture of middle-priced and     
 high-priced property                  
     Only a small number of families   
 originate from this area.Many have    
 moved here from Belfast and other     
 towns in recent years                 
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
