		<title>01FARMING AREA SOUTH OF LARNE</title>
		<content> This block is in Co.Antrim, N.Ireland.
 It  is  situated  SW of  the  town  of
{Larne. }It  is  part  of  the { Antrim
{Plateau,} but  it  only  contains  the
 summit.  To  reach  this  part  of the
 Plateau  from  the coastal plain,  you
 must  climb  steeply to 100 feet. This
 is a rural area with a low population,
 except for a  small  village   called 
{Millbrook,}which is 2 miles from      
 Larne.  Through the  block,  the{Larne
{(or Ollarbha) River}flows in a north- 
 easterly direction  into Larne (sea)  
 Lough, a flow   of  about 5 miles. The
 river is small, but  contains trout,  
 and at least one salmon has been found
 in it. Along  the  left  bank  runs   
 the  most important  road  for  Larne,
 the {A8,}going  to  all  the  main    
 centres  in Ireland. The  A8  is dual-
 carriageway over the  part which runs 
 through this block.                   </content>
