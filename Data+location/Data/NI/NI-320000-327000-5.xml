		<content> Most people in Hilltown have got      
 telephones.There used to be a public  
 telephone but it is now broken.Shops  
 have got telephones which anyone can  
 use.I haven't got a telephone but I   
 can still get in touch with a person  
 by post.The post is not sorted in     
 Hilltown now so it is a bit           
 irregular.Some farmers in Hilltown use
 tractors to travel short distances but
 most people use cars.I haven't got a  
 car but I can still travel by bus.For 
 example there is a bus from Hilltown  
 to Newry and then a bus home          
 again.There is also a bus from        
 Hilltown to Rathfriland.Most people   
 from Castlewellan,Kilkeel and Leitrim 
 would have cars because I wuuldn't say
 that they would walk from their homes 
 up to Hilltown.If I wanted to get to  
 places like Warrenpoint,Banbridge and 
 Belfast my grandfather would take me. </content>
