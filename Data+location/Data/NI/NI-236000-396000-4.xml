		<content> Height is a problem for farming but   
 some farmers have tried to push       
 cultivation into higher areas.One good
 example is on the higher slope of{    
{Knockavoe.}Here the land used to      
 consist of peat,heather and moss.The  
 land was dug with a large digger which
 had extra wide caterpillar tracks to  
 prevent it sinking.Some of the subsoil
 was mixed with the peat.Huge          
 quantities of stones were brought to  
 the surface.The land was then drained 
 and levelled.A large amount of ground 
 limestone was applied (about 12 tonnes
 per hectare)to reduce the acidity of  
 the peat.The ground was disc harrowed 
 and fertilizer and grass-seed sown.   
 This provides grazing land for sheep  
 at nearly 300 metres.                 
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
