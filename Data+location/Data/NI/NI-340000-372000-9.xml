		<title>09A VISIT TO A DUNDONALD FARM</title>
		<content> On Wednesday 8th May 1985 we paid a   
 visit to a large dairy farm in        
 Dundonald.The farm is owned by a      
 family called Blakiston-Houston.There 
 are three hundred and fifty British   
 Friesian dairy cows.Each cow gives    
 roughly 6000 litres of milk in one    
 year and each cow has one calf a year.
 When we arrived we saw the main herd  
 and when they saw us they thought that
 they were going to be milked because  
 they ran to meet us.Then we saw the   
 young calfs and they sucked our       
 fingers.Then we met the two bulls,they
 were very big.We saw all round the    
 farm and Mr.Crawford,the manager,gave 
 us each a flavoured milk drink.We     
 enjoyed our visit very much indeed.   
 In the summer the farm sells its      
 strawberry crop on "pick your own"    
 basis.                                
                                       </content>
