		<title>06A HISTORY OF ROCKPORT II</title>
		<content>  Within the last twenty years some    
 stables have been converted into an   
 assembly hall,a cow byre into a small 
 gymnasium and then into an art room   
 when a large sports hall was built,   
 trees have been removed to make space 
 for an all-weather games pitch and    
 many prefabricated buildings have been
 erected to provide extra classroom    
 accommodation and dining room         
 facilities.                           
    Over the years ,much of the land   
 that went with the house has been sold
 off to neighbouring concerns such as  
 Glencraig Community (q.v.)and         
 Glencraig Primary School.             
  Fortunately , the main house is now a
 listed building so it will always     
 maintain its beautiful Georgian       
 elegance.
