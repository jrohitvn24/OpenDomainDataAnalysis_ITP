		<title>07Beef Farming:GARY H</title>
		<content> This winter my father had about forty 
 six beef cattle in a yard and fed them
 after milking the cows.He gave them   
 nuts which help the cattle to fatten  
 up and he gave them silage using a    
 David Brown tractor and grab.He lifts 
 silage out of the pit and drops it    
 into the round feeder from which the  
 cattle feed.He scrapes the yard with a
 tractor and scraper once a week.They  
 drink water from a bowl in the yard.  
 This month (May)he brought six prime  
 bullocks to the abattoir.He received  
 Â£1.76 per kilo.In the summer the      
 cattle are out on the grass.They do   
 not get nuts because they have enough 
 grass.He will be bringing them to the 
 abattoir about September or October.By
 that time he hopes to be payed Â£700   
 or Â£800 for each animal which is about
 two years old.He has reared about 40  
 calves which he will sell in 2 years. </content>
