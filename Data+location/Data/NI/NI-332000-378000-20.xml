 or factories in the district.The      
 majority of people living here travel 
 to work by bus and car each           
 day.Traffic into Belfast is           
 particularly heavy between the hours  
 of 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. This is because   
 many commuters are travelling to their
 place of work.Between 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.
 most people return home from work.
