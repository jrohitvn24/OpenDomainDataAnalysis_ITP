		<title>11FAMILY LIFE IN FATHOM</title>
		<content> In this area most families own a car  
 as they are situated approx. 2 miles  
 from Newry.  Most families have       
 household pets _ cats, dogs, rabbits. 
 The people are very friendly and visit
 each other regularly.  The average    
 family would get up at approx.  7.30  
 am in order to go to work and school, 
 and would go to bed at around ll pm.  
 One third of the women go out to work,
 while the rest remain at home with the
 small children.  An average family    
 would consist of about 4 children.    
 Generally they have their main meal at
 6 o'clock after office hours, except  
 on Sundays when the main meal is at   
 midday.  On Sunday afternoons, during 
 the summer they travel to local       
 seaside resorts mainly Warrenpoint and
 Omeath.  In Winter time they remain at
 home.
