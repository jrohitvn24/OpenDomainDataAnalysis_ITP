		<content> Down Museum or{The St.Patrick Heritage
{Centre}as it shall also be known was  
 originally built in 1789 as the local 
 gaol and public execution place.      
   Its restoration cost 120,000 pounds,
 funded partly by the E.E.C.,the       
 Dept.of the Environment(historic      
 Buildings branch) and by the Dept. of 
 Economic Development.Down District    
 Council who provide the staff and     
 services of their Museum dept. also   
 paid towards its cost.                
   Public interest in this building at 
 the top of{English Street}stretches   
 from 1803 when Thomas Russell "the man
 from God knows where" was hanged at   
 the Gateway for his Republican deeds. 
   Although open to the public already,
 the final work will not be complete   
 until 1986.                           
   The Curator is{Dr.Brian S.Turner.}
