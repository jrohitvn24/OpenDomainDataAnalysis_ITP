		<content> People who live in our block attend   
 various clubs such as{Boys' Brigades  
 in Kilraughts and Ballyweaney Churches
 or the{Girls' Brigade}in Ballyweaney. 
 Churches around our area also have    
 badminton and bowling clubs where both
 men and women play.                   
 Young people over 12 years old go to  
 the{Young Farmers' Club}at Kilraughts.
 There they learn Public Speaking and  
 all about farming. Many ladies go to  
 the{Women's Institute}in Armoy which  
 is a kind of get together. Roman      
 Catholics have a hurling club and a   
{Gaelic Football}team in Loughguile.   
 There are plenty of opportunities in  
 our area for people, both old and     
 young, to belong to some type of club.
