		<content> Tullygarley National School was in    
 operation in the l87O's, being the    
 only school in the area. At the       
 beginning it had two classrooms, a    
 small one and a larger one each with  
 an open fire. The school had two      
 teachers who each taught four or five 
 classes. The school had no school     
 uniform and the pupils could wear what
 they wanted. As the school got larger 
 a mobile classroom was added. This was
 used by another two teachers. The     
 school stood in a dangerous position  
 at the busy Tullygarley crossroads. In
 its grounds it had a hard surface     
 playground with a small grassed area  
 on which trees and shrubs were planted
 by the boys. Tullygarley National     
 School closed in l967 because it was  
 too small for the numbers attending.  
 This is why the new school, Camphill  
 Primary, was opened.                  </content>
