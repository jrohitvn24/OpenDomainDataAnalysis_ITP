 In our area all children must go to   
 school. The starting age is around    
 five years and most young people leave
 at age sixteen. The others stay on    
 until they are eighteen.              
 At{Primary School,}children spend a   
 year in each of seven classes. When in
 the last class(known as P7), they do  
 an exam called{'The 11 Plus'.}If they 
 pass,they go to a{Grammar School,}but,
 if they fail, they go to a{Secondary  
{School.}At Grammar Schools they do    
 many subjects and work very hard, but 
 at Secondary Schools, they do more    
 practical things like woodwork and    
 cooking.                              
 After Grammar School, pupils usually  
 go to{Colleges}or{Universities,}but,  
 after Secondary School most pupils    
 want to start work.
