		<title>01Ands Peninsula-Southern Tip</title>
		<content> The southern tip of the Ands Peninsula
 is largely a grassland farming area.  
 Most inhabitants are either farm      
 owners or the families of one time    
 farm workers.   The foreshores are    
 almost completely rocky with few sandy
 areas.   On the eastern side lies the 
 Irish Sea while the western side      
 overlooks 'the Nannows' which forms   
 the enterence to Strangford Trough.   
 The tides at this enterence are       
 extremely damgerous and have reputedly
 the second fastest flowing current in 
 the British Isles.   Parts of the     
 foreshore are owned and protected by  
 the National Trust.   The ruins of an 
 early Christian Church-reputedly burnt
 in the 9th century by Saint Cooey-lie 
 in the North East segment adjacent to 
 Temple Cowey Point.
