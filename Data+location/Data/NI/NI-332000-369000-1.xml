		<title>01A GENERAL VIEW</title>
		<content>     This area lies to the south and   
 east of the city of{BELFAST.}It is    
 principally a residential area        
 containing a variety of housing styles
 varying from Victorian terraced blocks
 to modern detached residences and     
 Northern Ireland Housing Executive    
 estates. The River Lagan flows through
 the section. The whole area contains  
 many acres of green laid out chiefly  
 as playing fields. As most of these   
 acres are for exclusive school and    
 club use, public recreational         
 facilities are limited. The whole     
 section contains only one theatre and 
 one cinema.                           
     Three main roads out of Belfast   
 run through the section. Whilst there 
 are several schools, a teacher        
 training college and a hospital in the
 area, there are no major industrial   
 sites.             {(Stranmillis P.S.)</content>
