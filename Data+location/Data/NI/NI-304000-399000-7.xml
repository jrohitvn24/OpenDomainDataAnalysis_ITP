		<content> This area has seen vast changes over  
 the past  25 years. There have been   
 three types of new development:-      
{1. One storied bungalows}built beside 
 traditional two storied stone         
 farmhouses,usually by the farmers son.
{2.Council housing estates}built on the
 edge of Ahoghill e.g. Brookfield      
 Gardens,and Laurel Park.These are two 
 storied terraced houses built in      
 blocks of 20-30,amounting to about 400
 houses, with 50 single storied blocks 
 for the aged or handicapped.          
 Although mostly rented a few are being
 bought and improved by the tennants.  
{3.Private developments.}These are the 
 most recent buildings in the two      
 villages,with small estates of        
 detached and semi-det.houses.         
  These are in contrast to the stone   
 built,two storied{traditional houses  
 in central Ahoghill and Gracehill.    </content>
