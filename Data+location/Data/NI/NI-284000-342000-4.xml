		<content> The average acerage is {one hundred   
{acres}. The land is not entirely flat 
 . There are many hillocks . This is   
 probably one of the reasons for dairy 
 farming as opposed to crop growing .  
 It would be very hard to get some farm
 machinery up some of these hillocks   
 easily .The fields tend to be quite   
 small although there are some large   
 fields . In the larger flatter fields 
 some barley is grown . The soil in    
 the area is not very fertile and since
 the land tends to be damp, dairying   
 suits the conditions better than      
 arable farming.                       
 Most of the farms in our area are not 
 very modern and up to date .We stopped
 at some and noticed that the buildings
 and machinery are quite old . They    
 did not all seem to have milking      
 parlours and all the modern equipment 
 which goes with them.                 </content>
