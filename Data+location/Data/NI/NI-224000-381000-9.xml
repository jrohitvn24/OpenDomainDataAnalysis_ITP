		<content>       Some local people say that if   
 you stood on the mound in the field   
 before it was levelled you could see  
 both ways up and down the river in    
 front of you, and behind, you could   
 see right up to the hills, so it is   
 likely that this was the remains of   
 possibly a 5th century {EARTH FORT}or 
 even the site of a whole settlement.  
   Whenever they were trying to        
 investigate the {souterrain}the       
 entrance (a large boulder) was removed
 by a large bulldozer, it was then that
 the whole complex caved in, making a  
 large rumble.It was very sad to see   
 part of our heritage, which had lasted
 1500 years disappear in a split second
 with the use of modern machinery.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
