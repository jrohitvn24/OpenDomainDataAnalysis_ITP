		<title>02PORTORA CASTLE</title>
		<content>{Sir William Cole}acquired the land in 
 1612.He had to build a castle to      
 protect the{Planters.}In 1619 it was  
 described as follows:"...Upon this    
 proportion is a bawn of lime and stone
 68ft.square and 13 ft.high with four  
 flankers and a stone house as castle  
 three stories high."                  
     Although it is called a castle it 
 is really a{fortified manor.}In 1621  
 it  was let or sold to{Dr.James       
{Spottiswood,}who later moved to       
{Clogher,}although his son remained.   
     In 1688 it was used as an outpost 
 by{Governor Gustavus Hamilton}during  
 the wars to guard the ford nearby.    
     In 1858 a large block of the wall 
 was blow up by schoolboys.More fell in
 the great gale of 1893.               
     The ruins are now protected and   
 some restoration has been carried out.
