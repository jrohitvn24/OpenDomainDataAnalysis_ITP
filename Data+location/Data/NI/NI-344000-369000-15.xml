{ }Comber Senior Citizens meet on      
 Thursdays in the Unitarian Church     
 Hall.  In the hall they get their     
 dinner for 45p.  They also do         
 handcrafts and play games but most of 
 all they adore the company.  The      
 dinners are soon stopping _ it is a   
 pity as some of the old people can't  
 make dinners themselves.              
   Some senior citizens get "meals on  
 wheels"; others live in beautiful     
 little bungalows but the others have  
 unsuitable old houses.  I think they  
 badly need sheltered dwelling with    
 their own hall and more facilities for
 the handicapped, and the government   
 should spend more money on the        
 elderly. The old people would like    
 more music, facilities for playing    
 bowls and holidays _ I think they     
 should get them.                      </content>
