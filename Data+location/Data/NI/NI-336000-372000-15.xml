		<title>15House Life / Housing</title>
		<content> In November 1984, we moved to a bigger
 house. The last house was in          
 Orangefield Gardens &amp; had 3 bedrooms. 
 The house we live in now is in Cyprus 
 Park and has 5 bedrooms. There was a  
 lot of hassle in moving. We looked at 
 one house and then another but found  
 the house in Cyprus Park the nicest.  
 There was another family who put in an
 offer and nearly got the house. Our   
 new house is much bigger with a       
 kitchen, a lounge, a breakfast room, a
 dining room and a cloakroom as well as
 a separate bathroom and toilet and the
 bedrooms.Outside there is another     
 toilet, a garage, a boilerhouse and a 
 large garden where we have a          
 greenhouse and also enough room to    
 keep our dogs. I like our new house   
 much better. I also like living in the
 eighties- it's a great time to live   
 in.                                   </content>
