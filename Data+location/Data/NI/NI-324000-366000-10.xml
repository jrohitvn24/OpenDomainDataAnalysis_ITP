		<content> The provision of{recreational         
{amenities}in this area has improved   
 slowly in recent years.               
 Apart from a{BMX track,}no new amenity
 has been provided since the 1960's.   
 The amenities which do exist,are      
 mostly concentrated in the south-east 
 where the greatest density of housing 
 is to be found.The Milltown housing   
 estate has a children's playground in 
 a poor state of repair and some open  
 ground.The Lambeg playground is in    
 only slightly better condition.       
  On Harmony Heights,there is a council
 playing field but this area is without
 any other much needed children's      
 playground or proper youth club       
 facility.   {SEE **NOTE*              
  For other{recreational activities,}  
 the area is well served by facilities 
 in{Belfast}and{Lisburn. }
