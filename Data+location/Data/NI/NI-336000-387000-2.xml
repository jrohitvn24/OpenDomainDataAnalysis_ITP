		<title>02SALT MINES OF CARRICKFERGUS.</title>
		<content> In 1852 the Marquis of Downshire made 
 trial bores in search of coal near    
 Carrickfergus.  At Duncrue (fortress  
 of blood) rock salt, not coal was     
 struck at about 600 feet from the     
 surface, the stratum of salt was up to
 100 feet thick.                       
                                       
      In 1856 a tramway was made from  
 Duncrue to the Northern Counties      
 Railway.  Works were erected at       
 Jennymount for the conversion of rock 
 salt to white salt but this was       
 abandoned in 1878.                    
                                       
      In 1887 new works were erected to
 dissolve the rock salt into brine,    
 which  was piped to Clipperstown,     
 where it was boiled and the salt      
 distributed by rail all over          
 Ireland.The saltmines were the only   
 ones in Ireland.                      </content>
