		<title>07LEGENDS OF LOUGH NEAGH</title>
		<content> LOUGH NEAGH IS THE LARGEST LAKE IN THE
 BRITISH ISLES. ACCORDING TO LEGEND A  
 FAMOUS GIANT FINN MC COOL HAD A ROW   
 WITH ANOTHER GIANT LIVING IN SCOTLAND.
 ONE DAY IN A RAGE HE SCOOPED UP A     
 HANDFUL OF EARTH AND FLUNG IT ACROSS  
 THE SEA AT HIS ENEMY BUT IT FELL SHORT
 AND LANDED IN THE SEA AND FORMED AN   
 ISLAND WHICH TODAY IS KNOWN AS THE    
 ISLE OF MAN. THE HOLE LEFT IN THE     
 GROUND FILLED UP WITH WATER AND BECAME
 LOUGH NEAGH.                          
                                       
 MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT A PIECE OF   
 WOOD LEFT IN THE WATERS OF THE        
 LOUGH FOR A LONG TIME WILL TURN TO    
 STONE AND THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF  
 THIS PETRIFIED WOOD.                  
                                       
 THE FISHERMEN HAVE MANY STORIES TO    
 TELL AND MANY SUPERSTITIONS HAVE GROWN
 UP AROUND THE LOUGH.                  </content>
