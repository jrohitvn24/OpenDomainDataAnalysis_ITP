		<content> Antrim is an historical area and      
 around our school is no exception.    
 Within the grounds is an old fairy    
 thorn bush which has never been cut   
 down because of evil superstitious    
{traditions.}The grounds are bounded by
 an old stone wall which was built by  
 poor labourers during the{Irish Famine
 and hence is called a Famine wall or a
 Penny-a-day wall.                     
{Ancient remains:}the local Rathenraw  
 housing estate takes its name from a  
 Celtic Irish rath,the mound of which  
 has survived.Also in the area there   
 are a motte and bailie mound,a        
 chambered grave and a souterrain.     
 The farmland was formerly divided into
 several large estates and some of the 
 great{estate houses}remain            
 e.g.Campbell Hall and Hungry Hall.
