		<title>05FISHING AND SHOOTING</title>
		<content> There are ample opportunities for     
 those who are keen on fishing and     
 shooting to pursue their sporting     
 activities.Perch are plentiful in     
 Carrick, Monawilkin and Tonagh lakes  
 while the Sillies river,and it's      
 tributaries,produce perch, bream, pike
 and indeed, the occasional trout.     
 Spinning and worming are the usual    
 methods employed by the fishermen.As a
 matter of fact the Sillies, which is  
 very adjacent to the village of       
 Derrygonnelly, provides many hours of 
 fishing pleasure to the young people  
 of the area.                          
             Shooting enthusiasts      
 derive much pleasure from the pursuit 
 of pheasants, wild duck and snipe     
 which are usually fairly plentiful.   
 Indeed wild geese are often seen on   
 the lakes and rivers.
