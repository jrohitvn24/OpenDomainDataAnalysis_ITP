		<title>05NEW HOUSES IN CREGGAN</title>
		<content> FOR MANY YEARS PEOPLE WERE NOT ALLOWED
 TO BUILD NEW HOUSES IN THIS AREA. WHEN
 THEY GOT MARRIED THEY HAD TO MOVE TO  
 RANDALSTOWN OR ANTRIM TO GET A HOUSE. 
 ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THINGS CHANGED AND
 A LOT OF NEW HOUSES HAVE BEEN BUILT   
 SINCE AND ARE STILL BEING BUILT.      
                                       
 MOST OF THE HOUSES ARE BUNGALOWS AND  
 ALL OF THEM ARE BUILT ON LARGE SITES  
 SO ALL THESE HOUSES HAVE LARGE GARDENS
 WITH PLENTY OF SPACE BETWEEN HOUSES.  
 ALL OF THESE HOUSES ARE PRIVATELY     
 OWNED AND EACH HOUSE IS DIFFERENT FROM
 ALL THE OTHERS.                       
                                       
 MANY OF THE NEW HOUSES ARE BUILT ON   
 ROADS RUNNING DOWN TO THE LOUGH AND   
 HAVE LOVELY VIEWS OF THE LOUGH SHORE. 
                                       
 THERE ARE STILL MANY OLD HOUSES IN THE
 AREA.                                 </content>
