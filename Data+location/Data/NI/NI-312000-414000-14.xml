		<title>14THE ROSARY AT HOME</title>
		<content> Every night Daddy asks me to get the  
 rosary beads and leave them on the    
 mantle piece.  Everybody has Rosary   
 beads even{Julie Ann.}I kneel down at 
 the sofa. Usually daddy starts off.   
 Every time we answer Julie ann says   
{"deaf Amen". }She keeps moving from   
 one place to another. I think she     
 likes distracting everybody from their
 Rosary. Sometimes she puts her Rosary 
 beads round her neck. Eileen always   
 says to Daddy can I say it now.  As   
 there is only five mysteries I don't  
 always get saying one. I like saying  
 the Joyful Mysteries the best because 
 I know all the stories in it well and 
 its easy to meditate on them.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
