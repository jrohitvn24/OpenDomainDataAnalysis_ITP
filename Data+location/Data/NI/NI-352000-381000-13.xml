		<title>13HOUSING IN GROOMSPORT</title>
		<content>   As Groomsport was a fishing village 
 most of the old houses are close to   
 the sea.This was handy for the        
 fishermen.                            
   The new houses are built on a hilly 
 area to give the residents a good view
 of the harbour and Belfast Lough.     
   There are very few hotels in the    
 area.Groomsport House is probably the 
 largest.However there are two caravan 
 parks on the East or Donaghadee side  
 of the village.                       
   The most recent houses built are in 
 the grounds of Groomsport House.These 
 were completed in January 1985.
