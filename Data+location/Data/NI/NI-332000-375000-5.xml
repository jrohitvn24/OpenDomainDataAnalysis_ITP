		<content> Mrs.Gault, who was Grove P.S's.       
 caretaker for 3 years, was born in    
 1925, and if she were still alive     
 today she would be 60.   When Mrs     
 Gault was small her chores            
 were different from ours.  Scrubbing  
 bare stairs and cleaning the fire took
 three hours.  Sometimes she might have
 helped her Mum to make bread because  
 it was cheaper than buying it.  In    
 those days they didn't have any       
 washing machines and that meant that  
 they had to boil lots of buckets of   
 water, and wash their                 
 clothes by hand. When she was at      
 school there was a boy who had no     
 shoes. The boy's family were so poor  
 that they couldn't afford any.        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
