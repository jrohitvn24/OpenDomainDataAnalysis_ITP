		<content> (the first)cut of silage is taken for 
 winter fodder. We make some hay as    
 well in July.                         
    As well as cows we have 29 small   
 lambs, 10 ewes and one ram. Some of   
 these we sheared last week, mid-June. 
 The fleeces are tied in bundles and   
 taken to Antrim to the Ulster Wool    
 Growers Association. We also have a   
 dozen hens - the eggs are for family  
 use.                                  
    Daddy grows vegetables too, spring 
 onions, potatoes and brussel sprouts. 
 He sells these in Belfast Market. In  
 summer we sell strawberries and in    
 Autumn, plums and Bramley apples.     
    Farming is a continuous job.       
 Because of the milking the family     
 seldom get a holiday all together: if 
 we go away for a day trip we must     
 hurry home.
