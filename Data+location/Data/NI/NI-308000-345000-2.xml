 Dwellings are approached by long      
 laneways.                             
      As far as agricultural uses are  
 concerned drumlins have two           
 disadvantages.  While most drumlins   
 have gentle slopes (5 to 7 degrees)   
 and provide few dangers to working    
 machinery, others have much steeper   
 slopes (14 to 20 degrees) and portions
 of such slopes are rarely cultivated  
 since such steep slopes would         
 constitute severe dangers for modern  
 machinery.  These slopes are left as  
 permanent grazing.                    
      The second disadvantage is the   
 lack of drainage that may occur on    
 lower slopes where a number of        
 drumlins meet in a circular fashion.  
 Lakes, marsh and bog land have evolved
 in such circumstances.  One such      
 example is{Kernan Lake}_ and          </content>
