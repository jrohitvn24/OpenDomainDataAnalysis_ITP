		<title>12MARKET GARDENING</title>
		<content>   Since our survey block lies on the  
 doorstep of an urban population of    
 20,000+,it is not surprising that {   
{market-gardening}is important. Several
 householders are involved in a small  
 way,for this is a very labour-        
 intensive occupation.                 
   Potatoes are grown,but while the    
 ploughing,planting,spraying and       
 digging are usually done by machinery,
 the gathering of the potatoes is often
 done by hand. Lettuce,scallions,leeks,
 cabbage,cauliflower,carrots,turnips   
 and parsnips are grown and all demand 
 manual work. Mushrooms,too,are        
 important. These must be grown in a   
 constantly warm temperature; one      
 producer grows them under polythene,  
 while another grows them in houses.   
   Soft-fruit growing is popular _     
 strawberries,raspberries,blackcurrants
 and gooseberries are all produced here</content>
