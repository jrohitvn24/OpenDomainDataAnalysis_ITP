		<title>03School System in Dundonald</title>
		<content> In Dundonald education starts at the  
 age of three when you start nursery   
 school.At four and a half or five you 
 start Primary school and you stay     
 there until  you are eleven.Then there
 is a selection procedure which        
 consists of two verbal reasoning      
 tests.Depending on the results this   
 means that you either go to Grammar   
 school or High School.                
 There are no Grammar Schools in       
 Dundonald, just the Boys High and the 
 Girls High, so to go to Grammar school
 you have to go into Belfast.          
 At sixteen you can leave school to    
 start work or you can stay on until   
 you are eighteen to do A levels.      
 Depending on your results you can go  
 on for further education to college or
 university.
