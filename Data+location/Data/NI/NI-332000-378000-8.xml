		<title>08BELLEVUE ZOO</title>
		<content>   Bellevue or Befast zoo started in   
 the                                   
 1920's but has always been living in  
 the past.                             
 Up to about a year ago the zoo has    
 been quite small.                     
 Also the enclosures were of poor      
 quality .The zoo which was built on   
 the Cave Hill last year recieved a big
 change, everything was made modren.   
 In a dip in the hill a lake was       
 created, ducks of all kinds and swans 
 were put in.Further up there is a     
 large enclosure for polar bears it has
 an artifical rocks and a deep pool it 
 gives the polar bear more room to     
 swim.Further up still there is also   
 a new place for the penguins.Then     
 comes my favourite bit of the zoo,a   
 big place for the seals there is a    
 pool with rocks and an unwater window.
 this new zoo is better than ever.     </content>
