		<title>15JAMES HOPE AND THE PRESENT</title>
		<content> Jemmy Hope's grave is in the Mallusk  
 graveyard.Roughfort is still the same 
 today  as it was in Jemmy Hope's day. 
 Old weapons are sometimes found in old
 thatched cottages when they are being 
 demolished.The most beautiful monument
 of the rebellion is an old oak tree,  
 which is said to have been planted on 
 the first year of the rising.It stands
 opposite the "Ou'l Fort" with its head
 held high in defiance.                
  The 19th and 20th centuarys saw the  
 area provide employment in the local  
 linen mills,enjoy the relative        
 prosperity that this thriving Ulster  
 business brought and suffer as the    
 linen trade declined.                 
  In 1958,Newtownabbey Urban District  
 Council was set up and in 1973 the    
 status was changed.It became          
 Newtownabbey District Council without 
 any alterations to our assigned area. </content>
