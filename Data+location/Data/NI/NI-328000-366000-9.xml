 One of the sad things about living in 
 Northern Ireland today is the division
 between Protestants and Roman         
 Catholics. You can see this in        
 Dunmurry. Here the children are taught
 in different schools so that they     
 don't get to know each other. The     
 Catholics go to St Anne's school while
 the Protestants go to Dunmurry Primary
 School. They never meet in school or  
 Church or in youth organisations      
 except for occasional football and    
 badminton matches. When they pass one 
 another they feel bitter and sometimes
 start fights. It is sad to see this   
 and we hope that it will be better in 
 the future.
