		<title>20EDUCATION IN BELFAST</title>
		<content> Because of the decline in the school  
 population in recent years, the       
 Belfast Education and Library Board   
 have been attempting to close or merge
 a number of schools and this year,    
 1985, three N.Belfast secondary       
 schools are being closed and one new  
 school created to cater for the       
 children, despite strong and vocal    
 opposition to the scheme.  Objections 
 have included the loss of the only    
 single-sex schools in the area, and   
 the distance that pupils may have to  
 travel.  This can be especially       
 important in Belfast if the route to  
 school lies through or near areas     
 where trouble can arise because of the
 so-called religious divide.  In recent
 months a new group has announced the  
 opening of independent Primary and    
 Secondary schools called Hazelwood,   
 which will be religiously integrated. </content>
