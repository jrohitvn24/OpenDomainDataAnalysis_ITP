		<content>   Next season (1985-1986) Linfield    
 Football Club celebrates its          
 centenary. The first Linfield team    
 were workers at Linfield Linen Mill in
 Belfast's famous Sandy Row. It is now 
 the most powerful football team in the
 Irish League having won all the major 
 trophies many, many times. The team   
 has also played in many of the        
 European Competitions. Their home     
 ground is Windsor Park, just off the  
 main Lisburn Road in South Belfast. As
 it is the largest football stadium    
 available it is also used by the Irish
 Football Association for home         
 internationals. One of the highlights 
 of the year for all their football    
 fans is the open day when everyone can
 go and meet the players and see all   
 the trophies.
