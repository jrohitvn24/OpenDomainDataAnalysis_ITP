 planted earlier in the year. We       
 returned to Geography to complete the 
 work begun in period 3.               
  When the bell ended the class it was 
 lunchtime. I ate my packed lunch with 
 my friends and then went out to play  
 tennis (in which I was beaten!).      
 Lunchtime over we went to History to  
 learn about life in the Middle Ages.  
 From History we went to French and on 
 to finish the day in R.E. When the    
 bell rang at 3.30p.m. it was down to  
 the cloakrooms, grabbed our coats and 
 bags and headed out to get the bus    
 home.                                 
  At home I played with my Spectrum ZX 
 micro-computer before tea. After tea I
 did my homeworks, watched some        
 television and then went to bed.
