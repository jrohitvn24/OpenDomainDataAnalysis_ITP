		<title>11BROUGHSHANE PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content>    Broughshane Primary School is      
 situated in Houston Park and was      
 opened in September, 1964. Originally 
 there were 5 classrooms, an assembly  
 hall and a meals kitchen.This         
 accommodation soon became quite       
 inadequate and 5 mobile classrooms had
 to be utilized.                       
   At the moment plans have been       
 drawn-up to add permanent classrooms  
 but no firm decision has been reached 
 due to the financial restrictions.    
   All primary school subjects are     
 taught and there is a very strong     
 music department under the guidance of
 Mrs.Stirling,who also conducts the    
 wind band.Many sports are also played.
   The staff include Mr. Crooks(Prin.),
 Mr.Coulter(V.Prin.),Miss Gray, Mrs.   
 Graham, Mrs.Stirling, Mrs.Thompson,   
 Miss Anderson, Mrs.E.Jamieson, Miss   
 Mitchell and Mrs. S.Jamieson.         </content>
