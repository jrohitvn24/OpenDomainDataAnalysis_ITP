		<title>17THE LEISURE SURVEY 1-16</title>
		<content>    The Leisure Survey which was       
  carried out in Holywood acquired     
 information relating to the activities
 which are at present available and    
 also the activities which the four    
 different age groups would like to see
 provided in the near future.          
 1-16 AGE GROUP                        
    Some of the clubs in Holywood for  
 young people are Shell Club which has 
 twelve to fourteen members and meets  
 every Friday night and Bangor Road    
 Club which meets every Saturday night.
 Some other clubs which meet are the   
 Badminton club, Girls'and Boys'       
 Brigades which meet regularly on      
 Tuesday nights.                       
    Most children go to either Bangor  
 or Avoniel Leisure Centres but only go
 sometimes as the travelling costs are 
 high.
