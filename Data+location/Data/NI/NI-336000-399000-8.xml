		<title>08A FAMOUS PERSON</title>
		<content> The most famous person in this block  
 is Mr Roy Beggs. He is Ulster Unionist
 Member of Parliament for East Antrim  
 at Westminster. He is a Member of the 
 Northern Ireland Assembly; Larne      
 Borough Council and former Alderman   
 and Mayor, and is on many boards and  
 committees. He was Vice-Principal of  
 Larne High School. He is a member of  
 committee of the local Presbyterian   
 Church. His opinions reflect those of 
 practically all the residents of this 
 block. He stands firmly for Ulster    
 remaining within the United Kingdom.  
 He worries about the future of the    
 small farmer. He would like to see    
 more employment locally. He has fears 
 of the influence of the E.E.C. on     
 Northern Ireland. He would dearly love
 all the province to have the peace    
 which he finds in this area where he, 
 his wife Wilma and family live.       </content>
