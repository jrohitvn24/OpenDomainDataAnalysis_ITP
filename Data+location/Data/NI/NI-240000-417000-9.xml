		<content> Every year just before the summer     
 holidays we always go on a school     
 trip. This year we asked our teacher  
 if,instead of going away on a bus when
 it might be raining,we could go for   
 our outing to the {Templemore Sports  
{Complex.}Unfortunately,because of the 
 Council having to make cuts in        
 spending the Sports Complex does not  
 open in the mornings so our trip was  
 only a half-day.We had the choice of  
 swimming,or indoor games,or outdoor   
 games.Some of us went outdoors first  
 but we only played on the swings and  
 slides and climbing frames.then it    
 started to rain.We went into the      
 sports hall and we played football or 
 table-tennis or badminton or netball  
 for quite a while and then it was time
 for our swim.There were other people  
 there but we all enjoyed our swim even
 those who had begun to swim this year.</content>
