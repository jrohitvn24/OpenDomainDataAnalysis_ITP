		<title>09Shopping Facilities</title>
		<content> About 10 years ago when we first came 
 to live here there was a local shop   
 at the Six Roads Ends.A few groceries 
 and sweets and lemonade etc.Since it  
 closed down a few years ago we dont   
 have a local shop. However we still   
 have the{POST OFFICE,}which is very   
 useful for pensions, family allowances
 and general postal services. The Post 
 Office has newspapers and other       
 things. It would be good to have a    
 grocery and general store shop.This   
 kind of a shop would be useful for old
 people and young people instead of    
 travelling miles when you want to get 
 something. Bangor is our nearest place
 to shop but there is no bus route     
 there. The farmers could also do with 
 a shop that sells seed. Usually people
 with no cars have to get the bus away 
 into Newtownards or Donaghadee.
