		<title>18Life on a farm.</title>
		<content> I live on a small farm in Co.         
 Fermanagh. We have 20 cows, 12 sheep, 
 1 goat and 4 cats. We are very busy   
 all year round.                       
     In Summer we spend a few days     
 winning hay. We also spend 2 months   
 getting the turf ready for Winter.    
 Our Summer season is very busy.       
    The Autumn season is not as busy.  
 We just do the normal work - milking  
 cows and feeding the animals.         
    In Winter it is difficult to keep  
 them fed, warm and clean. Sometimes it
 can be so cold that the cows must be  
 kept in sheds.                        
    In Spring we usually buy cows but  
 sometimes we don't have to because    
 when our cows calve we keep them and  
 rear them for replacement stock.
