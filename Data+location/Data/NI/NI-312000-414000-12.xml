		<content>{Family life in Glenravel}appears to   
 be keeping up with{modern living.}The 
 majority of people have a car in fact 
 some families have two cars. A car in 
 Glenravel is really a necessity for   
 people travelling to work due to the  
 poor bus service. Every household     
 would have eletricity, washing        
 machines running water and all modern 
 amenities.This has happened in the    
 last ten years when people have       
 modernized their homes.               
    Every family has certain times for 
 getting up in the morning and for     
 going to bed at night.  They also     
 usually have rules like,{You're not   
{allowed to walk on the good carpet    
{with dirty boots on}Or {Don't throw   
{papers on the floor. }Most families   
 have their do's and dont's.
