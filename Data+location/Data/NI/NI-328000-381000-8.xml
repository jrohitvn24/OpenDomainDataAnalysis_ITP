		<content>   There is one new shopping complex in
 the centre of Glengormley with 12     
 units.  This is the Farmley Shopping  
 Centre behind which is located the    
 main car park for the Village Centre. 
   Further expansion of commercial and 
 shopping facilities are restricted by 
 close housing development and lack of 
 available space.                      
   Several larger warehouse type       
 furniture and D.I.Y. stores are       
 located close to the centre in        
 Glenwell Road.                        
   Shops surveyed in the area show that
 Thursday, Friday, Saturday are their  
 busiest days and that the majority of 
 shops stay open 6 days a week.
