		<content> Mary-Brook house is a working         
 mill.There is a corn and flax mill.The
 original mill was built in the 17th   
 century.There are two races that feed 
 water from the mill pond to the two   
 waterwheels.Farmers would bring corn  
 to the mill and they would weigh it   
 and haul it up and put it in a kiln to
 dry.Then it was shovelled down a chute
 into bags to be ground down into flour
 and taken away.They have an eel trap. 
 They sell their eels to London.The    
 flax mill is powered by the 2nd       
 Waterwheel.When the wheel turns it    
 makes the scutching machine grind     
 down the flax into pulp.Then it is    
 taken upstairs and paddles would make 
 it into fine threads.These mills are  
 owned by Mr and Mrs Lewis-Crosby.     
 Renavations started on the mill in    
{1973}.
