		<title>14Home Life_How I spent Sunday</title>
		<content>   On Sunday morning I went to Sunday  
 School and we were told about what    
 happened when the disciples met Jesus 
 after the Crucifixion.  When I came   
 home I helped make lunch.  Then I     
 watched "The Wizard of Oz" on         
 videotape.  At 2 o'clock I changed    
 into my jodhpurs and boots for horse  
 riding. I had to go 30 minutes earlier
 than usual. When I got there I went to
 see the Shetland pony.  It is called  
 "Tootsie" and is the smallest pony in 
 the whole riding school.  Soon, it was
 time for my lesson and I got a lovely 
 grey pony called "Ozzy".  Straight    
 after my lesson I was asked to lead in
 the beginners' ride.  Dinner was ready
 when I arrived home and afterwards I  
 sat down and watched television which 
 got boring so I wnet upstairs and did 
 puzzles.  As soon as "Bleak House"    
 came on I went to bed.                </content>
