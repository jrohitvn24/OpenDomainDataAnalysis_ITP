     Dumea Fashions is sited in Kilroot
 Park just off the Larne Road half a   
 mile to the North from Carrickfergus. 
     The Place was first opened on the 
 1st of January 1985, and they only    
 sell their dresses to saloons in      
 Northern Ireland.                     
    {They make beautiful wedding       
{dresses, flower girls' dresses and    
{brides_maids' dresses.                
     In the shop there are four people 
 and two trainees working there.       
     Most of the materials come from   
 Japan and at the minute they are      
 trying to get the materials to come   
 to them{direct}from Japan instead of  
 having to buy through London, because 
 if it came from in London it is harder
 to get it than it would if it came    
 direct to Northern Ireland.           </content>
