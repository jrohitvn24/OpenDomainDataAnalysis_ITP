		<content>   Comber is a small town but has quite
 good sports facilities.  At the minute
 there is a new{Leisure Centre}being   
 built which will have badminton and   
 squash courts, as well as a           
 multi_purpose hall.  There are tennis 
 courts nearby and there are also      
 hockey, cricket and football pitches. 
 Many people enjoy swimming but in the 
 meantime we must go to the Newtownards
 pool.                                 
   There is a snooker hall in Comber   
 along with facilities for fishing and 
 boating.  A few miles out of Comber   
 there is a riding school.  In Comber  
 there are also Youth Clubs and all the
 Church Organisations: Scouts, Guides  
 and Girls' and Boys' Brigades.  There 
 are also "Ulster Ways" for walking and
 cycling.  The best improvement, in my 
 view, would be a swimming pool, as it 
 would save bus fares.                 </content>
