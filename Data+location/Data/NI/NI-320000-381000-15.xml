 feeding out of buckets.There were 3   
 calves in the house_2 were 1 week old 
 and the other one was 1 month old.The 
 hay shed was nearly empty.There were  
 some bales of hay and straw on either 
 side.The milking parlour can take 8   
 cows at a time.A cow would give an    
 average of 5 litres a day.A very poor 
 milker would give 3 litres per day.A  
 very good milker would give 8-9 litres
 per day.After that we went to the     
 silage pit.It was empty,ready for next
 week's silage. Mr.Wallace had been    
 cleaning out a calfhouse for the young
 calves.It held about 20 calves.His    
 future plans are to keep on increasing
 his herd.
