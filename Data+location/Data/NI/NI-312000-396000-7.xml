 resident was how many years had he    
 lived in Kells and his answer was 40  
 years.I asked him what his earliest   
 memories of Kells were .He said that  
 when he first came to Kells Condiere  
 Avenue or Glenaan Park wasn't built   
 it was all green fields around there. 
 The next question I put to him was did
 he remember what he was doing from    
 1914 to 1918.His answer was he didn't 
 live in Kells then he lived in        
 Belfast.I asked him what his memories 
 of Kells were during the second world 
 war.He said he was in Germany         
 fighting.The question I asked him was 
 how had houses changed since he was   
 young.His answer was that houses were 
 small and had thatched roofs.The fire 
 was just a hole in the ground and     
 people used peat on the fire instead  
 of coal.                              </content>
