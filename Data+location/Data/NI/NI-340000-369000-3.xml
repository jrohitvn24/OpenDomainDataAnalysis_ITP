		<content> The school is involved in{Riding for  
{the Disabled}and has set aside Monday,
 Tuesday and Thursday of each week     
 especially for groups of mentally     
 handicapped children and disabled     
 people to enable them to partake in   
 this recreation.                      
                                       
 The school has built up a considerable
 reputation throughout the area for its
 work in this field, and many of the   
 handicapped who have been taught to   
 ride at{Millbridge}have gone on to    
 participate in competitions with      
 considerable success.                 
                                       
 The children especially enjoy this    
 form of leisure and it is a very      
 popular outdoor pursuit in the area.
