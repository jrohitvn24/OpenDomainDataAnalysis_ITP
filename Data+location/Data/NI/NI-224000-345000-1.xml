		<content> The character of the area we have     
 studied is largely determined by its  
 proximity to the town of Enniskillen. 
 The area immediately adjoining the    
 town contains a relatively high       
 proportion of private and public      
 housing and contains several          
 factories.The rural area is quite     
 sparsely populated and is bisected by 
 several third class roads.The land is 
 reasonably good grass land and is used
 mainly for grazing cattle.The area is 
 somewhat lacking in amenities but     
 this is to some extent compensated for
 by the the ample provision of sporting
 and cultural facilities in nearly     
 Enniskillen.Cradian R.C.Church        
 situated near the rural boundary of   
 the area provides a focal point for   
 the Catholic population of the parish.
 The rural area has changed relatively 
 little over the years.                </content>
