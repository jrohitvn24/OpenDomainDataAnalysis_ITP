		<title>01Area North East of Garvagh</title>
		<content>  This area is made up of flat, well   
 drained terrain. The land is used by  
 farmers in the area for both highly   
 cultivated grassland for grazing and  
 fodder crops and also for crop        
 cultivation.  The farms in this area  
 are prosperous and well managed and   
 crop rotation is evident, giving high 
 yields and quality produce.  The      
 farmsteads are mainly large modern    
 buildings with numerous out-buildings 
 providing storage facilities and      
 winter shelter for livestock.  The A29
 runs north/south through this area    
 serviced by minor roads.  The only    
 public amenities in the are are a post
 office/shop, gospel hall, orange hall 
 and telephone box.  The Agivey River -
 triutary of the Bann - flows through  
 the area in a north esterly direction.
 Private dwellings in this area are    
 mainly modern bungalows               </content>
