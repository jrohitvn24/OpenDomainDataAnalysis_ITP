		<title>11SCHOOL LIFE AT SCARVA</title>
		<content> We go to school at five or ten past   
 nine as school begins at 9.15 am.     
 First we all go to Assembly where the 
 Headmaster,Mr. Potts talks to us and  
 then we sing a hymn, say prayers and  
 return to our classroom.              
  We start with spellings followed by  
 mathematics. By then it is 10.30.,time
 for our Break.                        
  During our Break we eat crisps and go
 outside to play rounders or football. 
 The bell rings at 10.50. when we come 
 in and usually finish our mathematics.
 Later we take note of our homework    
 after which we read ,write or discuss 
 work we plan to do. Our lunch time    
 lasts from 12.30. to 1.20.            
  Most afternoons are spent doing such 
 things as music,environmental         
 projects,needlework and craft. School 
 ends at 3.10.pm..
