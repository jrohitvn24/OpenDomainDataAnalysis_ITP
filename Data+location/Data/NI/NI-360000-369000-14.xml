 l846. The present Lord succeeded his  
 father in l956. He was educated at    
 Eton and Cambridge.

 farm labourer, a petrol pump attendant
 and as an assistant to an organ       
 builder.

 and vintage cars but is not too keen  
 on blood sports.                      
    He has travelled to numerous       
 countries and participates regularly  
 in the House of Lords. He is also a   
 member of the Northern Ireland        
 Assembly and is keen to help people.  
 He is patron of the Holy Trinity      
 Church, Ballywalter.                  
    On his estate of l,200 acres
