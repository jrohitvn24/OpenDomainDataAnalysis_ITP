		<title>01DUNGANNON AND HINTERLAND</title>
		<content> This block, though predominently rural
 in character, is dominated by the     
 small market town of Dungannon. The   
 town situated in the north eastern    
 corner of the block is the main       
 comercial centre. It provides         
 marketing outlets for the livestock   
 reared in the surrounding agricultural
 area. The modern town dates from the  
 eighteenth century. However the whole 
 area formed the heartland of the      
 gaelic irish O'Neill family, who      
 dominated Ulster prior to the         
 plantation at the beginning of the    
 seventeenth century. Hugh O'Neill, the
 last Earl of Tyrone, built a house on 
 the hill which overlooks the present  
 town. The present population is       
 approximately 10,000 with very little 
 increase in the last ten years.       
 Changing patterns of industry and     
 employment may account for this.      </content>
