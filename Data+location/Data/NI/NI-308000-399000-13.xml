		<title>13Housing in our area</title>
		<content>      In our area we have both private 
 and public housing estates.  The      
 style, design and shape of the houses 
 vary a great deal.  Adjacent to our   
 school we have a small private estate 
 which consists entirely of bungalows. 
 These houses are well maintained and  
 all have neat, well-kept gardens.     
 Each has a garage and most people own 
 a motor car.  A network of good roads 
 links the entire area.  Near by is    
 a large area of public housing.  This 
 too has been well designed and the lay
 out of the houses has been carefully  
 thought out to give an air of         
 spaciousness. The houses have been    
 grouped together to form an           
 interesting skyline of geometric      
 shapes. Shrubs and trees have been    
 planted to give a most pleasing       
 effect.
