		<content> The land outside Carrowdore is mainly 
 arable land with farms everywhere and 
 maybe a few houses on their own.  The 
 farmers use the land for wheat, barley
 silage and grazing land.              
 The village itself consists of private
 housing and Council owned properties. 
 Every house has a garden and there are
 no flats in Carrowdore.               
 The village has a very wide Main      
 Street, a supermarket, a Post Office, 
 a garage, two small shops a playing   
 area and a Primary School.            
 Just outside the village is the Castle
 which is completely surrounded by a   
 forest.                               
 In September the village hosts a      
 Motorbike Race called the Carrowdore  
 100.
