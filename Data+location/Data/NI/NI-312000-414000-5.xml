		<title>05THE LAMBING</title>
		<content>{It is April and it is lambing time.}We
 have{180 Ewes}and by the time lambing 
 is over we will have{twice as many    
{lambs}as Ewes. This year our lambing  
 started off badly.Many died but after 
 that we had a lot of twins to make up 
 for it .This year we have two         
 different{kinds}of lambs{,Crossbreads 
{and Blackfaces}.Crossbreds are a cross
 between Blackface ewes and Leicester  
 tips. We have three Leicester tips and
 one lamb{.Sometimes}the ewe can not   
 lamb herself so we have to pull it out
 gently.If a lambs mother dies or if   
 she can not feed the lamb it becomes a
 pet.We have four pet lambs.We heat up 
 milk and feed them in a pen .They are 
 very tame and a great nuisance .
