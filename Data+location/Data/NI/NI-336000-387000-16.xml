		<content> Within the Courtaulds Industrial      
 Complex is a unit of the University of
 Ulster which is carrying out research 
 into improving road construction. They
 are testing various types of stones   
 and surfaces for durability and skid  
 resistance. They have found that salt 
 spread on roads can cause skidding    
 whereas urea is more skid resistant   
 and does not have the corrosive       
 effects of salt. At present there is a
 work force of eight men.              
      William M. Bamford and Sons of   
 154 Woodburn Road was established in  
 1962 with a work force of two, it has 
 expanded to employ thirty two workers 
 who deal with all type of steel       
 fabrication including fabrication of  
 sheet metal, stainless steel and      
 aluminium.They were one of the main   
 contractors for the Marina            
 construction completed in 1985.       </content>
