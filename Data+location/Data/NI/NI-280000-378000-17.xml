		<title>17TRADE:COOKSTOWN STREET MARTS</title>
		<content>   Market day in Cookstown is          
 Saturday.This originated from a       
 charter granted in the reigh of       
 Charles I confering the right to hold 
 a market.                             
   Every Saturday traders come from all
 over the province and set up their    
 stalls along both sides of the main   
 street.They sell a great variety of   
 items.While clothing and fabrics      
 dominate there are also hardware,fruit
 and vegetables,jewellery including    
 watches,electrical goods,eggs,footwear
 and carpets.                          
   This market attracks a great many   
 people into the town and as Saturday  
 is also an important livestock sales  
 day families will come in from a wide 
 radius.The main problem arising from  
 this is car parking,the official car  
 parks being quiet inadequate and quiet
 serious conjestion arises.            </content>
