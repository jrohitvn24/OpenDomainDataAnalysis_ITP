{BON-NA-MARGY FRIARY IN THE PARISH OF  
{CULFEIGHTRIN,BARONY OF CAREY AND THE  
{GLENS OF ANTRIM.                      
  THE SITE OF BON-NA-MARGY MONESTRY IS 
 IN ITSELF VERY BEAUTIFUL AND MUST HAVE
 GIVEN CONSTANT DELIGHT AND            
 SATISFACTION TO THE OCCUPIERS WHEN THE
 FRIARY WAS IN ITS EARLY GLORY.        
  IN A MANUSCRIPT LIST IN THE BRITISH  
 MUSEUM IT IS SAID THAT  THIS          
 FRANCISCAN MONESTRY WAS FORMED BY     
{ROY MACQUILLAN IN THE YEAR 1500.      
 IT SEEMS FROM THE PLACING OF THIS     
 FRIARY THAT THE FRANCISCAN MONKS      
 WANTED TO HAVE AS HARD A LIFE AS      
 POSSIBLE TO SERVE GOD.                
  BON-NA-MARGY'S SITUATION IS FACING   
 AGAINST SOME OF THE COLDEST AND       
 FIERCEST WINDS                        
                                       </content>
