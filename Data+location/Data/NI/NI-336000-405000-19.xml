		<title>19FAMILY AT TOBERGELL</title>
		<content>{Peter and Rita O'Rourke,}who live at  
{Tobergell Lane, 6km N of Larne,}have 1
{son and 3 daughters.}Peter works as a 
{journalist}with a Belfast newspaper so
 he has to{travel about 60km}to and    
 from his work each day.               
 The family spent 15years in England , 
 before moving back to Ireland in 1974.
 They are thinking of moving again due 
 to the{remoteness of the area.}The    
 nearest shops are at least 3km away at
 Ballygally. The O'Rourkes have{2 cars 
 but Mrs O'Rourke cannot drive now     
 because of ill_health. The{bus service
 is irregular so she feels cut off.    
 She depends on{mobile shops,}which    
 visit the lane several times a week.A 
 Larne shopkeeper calls on Monday to   
 take orders. Tues.&amp; Thur. a bread and 
 grocery van calls,and on Fri.the green
 grocer comes. Goods bought from these 
 mobile vans are dearer than in Larne. </content>
