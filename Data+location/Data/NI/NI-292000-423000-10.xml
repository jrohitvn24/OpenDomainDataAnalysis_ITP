		<title>10A TEENAGER'S LIFE--1</title>
		<content> I live with my family in a two-storey,
 three bedroomed house just outside    
 Ballymoney. I wake each weekday       
 morning at 7.00am. and once I have    
 tidied my bedroom I wash and dress    
 before breakfast. Then I collect my   
 bags and leave home at 8.35am. to walk
 to{the bus stop}50 yards away. The bus
 arrives at 8.45am. and makes a few    
 stops before arriving in Ballymoney at
 9am..                                 
                                       
 In{school}it is essential to attend{  
{assembly}unless you have a late pass  
 if your bus is usually too late for   
 you to do this.{Assembly, in Dalriada 
{school}is a short non-sectarian       
 service,followed by announcements,    
 relating to the school about perhaps  
 how our teams have fared in matches   
 played against other schools.
