		<content> In our area of study there are three  
 Raths. Today 20th June 1985 we visited
 two of them and we talked to the      
 grandfather of one of the pupils who  
 told us a lot about them.             
      The Raths we visited are found   
 at Grid Reference  263596 and 271584. 
 The other one in our area is at       
 264580.                               
     Raths are circular banks of earth 
 inside which people in the days of the
 Celts used to live. The two examples  
 we visited were both on top of hills. 
 From there is a great view of the     
 surrounding countryside. They lived   
 inside these for security and defence 
 purposes. At this time the state was  
 very unstable and there was a lot of  
 fighting between different lords and  
 tribes. To defend themselves and their
 animals people lived in huts like     
 houses inside these earthen banks.    </content>
