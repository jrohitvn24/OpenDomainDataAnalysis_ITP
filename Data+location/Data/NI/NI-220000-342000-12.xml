		<content>   The Housing Executive have built six
 housing estates since 1947,and private
 developers the same.There is little   
 intermixing of these,each having their
 own area.Private house prices vary    
 from about 22000-55000 pounds.The     
 recent government legislation allowing
 tenants to buy public rented houses   
 has led to many doing so.The price    
 ranging from 5500-10000 pounds.{      
   Many people bemoan the loss of      
 housing from the island.Their{attitude
 is that people were there before      
 business and some houses should be    
 built on the island-{houses are more  
{important}than libraries,tax offices, 
 and in particular car parks!In 1983   
 some house and flats were built in    
 Market Street but there are no plans  
 to build more houses on the island but
 commercial expansion and road building
 is continuing.                        </content>
