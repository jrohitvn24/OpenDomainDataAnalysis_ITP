		<title>16DUNGANNON POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> The cost of sending a parcel varies   
 according to its weight. The heavier  
 the parcel is the dearer the cost of  
 sending it by post.                   
   The post office in Dungannon is     
 split into two different sections. At 
 the back there is a section  where the
 mail is sorted and sent for delivery. 
 There are forty two men employed in   
 the sorting office. The job of sorting
 is carried out by hand, as only the   
 large offices in the cities use       
 machines. All of the men help to sort 
 the letters and parcels. On average   
 7,500 letters and 85 parcels pass     
 through the Dungannon post office     
 every day. Of this 40% is for local   
 delivery while 60% goes abroad.       
 Letters, being sent to mainland       
 Britain are first sorted into bags    
 marked with the regions of            
 destination.                          </content>
