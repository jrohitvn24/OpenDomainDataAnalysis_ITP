		<title>19    THE GREEN ISLAND</title>
		<content>{ Greenisland}takes its name from a    
 small island situated about 50m from  
 the Antrim shore of{Belfast Lough.}A  
 causeway leads out to it so that it   
 looks more like a peninsula than an   
 island except during very high tides. 
  It is a{basalt}formation surrounded  
 by{triassic marl}and is distinguished 
 by the lush grassy covering that      
 gives it and the district their names.
{ (GREENISLAND)}                       
  About 50 years ago it covered an area
 of about 200sq.m.and was surrounded by
 a wall.This wall has now disappeared  
 and the size has been somewhat reduced
 by erosion.                           
  The island affords a splendid        
 position for naturalists who can      
 observe the varieties of sea_birds    
 over Belfast Lough and the seals which
 bask in the adjoining bay.
