		<content> Perhaps the most valuable resource (as
 in the whole of the Mournes) is the   
 scenic beauty of the mountains and    
 their potential for recreation. The   
 Mournes are readily accessible and two
 of the main access routes are through 
 this block. One of the best known     
 routes is along the Trassey track up  
 to the Hare's Gap. This route runs    
 NW-SE through square 4. It is an easy 
 walk and gives access to many climbing
 areas such as the crags on Spellack   
 (313296) and the Bearnagh Slabs       
 (311283).It also gives access to the  
 Northern end of the Brandy Pad (see   
 Slieve Commedagh block 03320327). The 
 Trassey track is of vehicular width   
 but very rough. Only farm vehicles and
 Land Rovers use it.                   
 The other main route into the         
 mountains in this block is the Ott    
 track which runs across square 9.     </content>
