		<title>15FARMING IN EAST BANGOR</title>
		<content>   Much of the land near the coast is  
 made up of rough grazing but East of  
 Groomsport there are two large caravan
 parks between the sea and the main    
 road.                                 
     Tne majority of fields in this    
 region are sown in grass for          
 animals,chiefly cattle.However one or 
 two fields had potatoes or cabbages   
 growing in them.                      
     The relief of the land is low,    
 generally below 40 feet and soils are 
 clay mixed with sand near the coast.  
     Farther East there is a large     
 reservoir where fly-fishing is        
 allowed.Some plantations of deciduous 
 trees and coniferous trees appear to  
 shelter some farms from the wind.     
 Fields are generally small in size and
 vary between 5 and 10 hectares.       
     Population density in these rural 
 areas is low.                         </content>
