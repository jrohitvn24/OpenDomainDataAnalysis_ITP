   St. Mary's High School was opened in
1960 and was one of the first secondary
schools to be opened in Co. Derry.     
   There are now 997 pupils and 63     
teachers at the school. The original   
school was extended in 1974 and is due 
further extension in the next few      
years.                                 
   Although the original school catered
for the 11-15 age range the raising of 
the school leaving age to 16 and the   
introduction of "A" level courses now  
means that children can attend from    
11-18.                                 
   Children come from the primary      
schools in Limavady and the            
neighbouring parishes of Faughanvale   
and Magilligan.
