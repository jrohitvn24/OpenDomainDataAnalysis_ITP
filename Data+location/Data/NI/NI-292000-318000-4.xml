		<content>  The boys in our school play football.
 For this, they wear navy jumpers      
 trimmed with white and shorts.The     
 girls play netball and they are       
 supplied with matching blouses and    
 wrap-a-round skirts.Both teams compete
 against other schools in the area,and 
 league matches are also held within   
 the school.This year, our school took 
 part in the newly formed Inter Primary
 Schools' Drama Festival.Our play,     
 "Spreading the News,"by Lady Gregory, 
 won the Adjudicator's Special Award   
 for Production. Following the success 
 of this, we staged an "End of Term"   
 fund raising concert in the nearby    
 Newtownhamilton hall.For this, each   
 class in the school participated. We  
 also entered for essay and poetry     
 writing competitions and won many     
 prizes. We won the Beattie Cup for    
 spoken Irish for 2 successive years.  </content>
