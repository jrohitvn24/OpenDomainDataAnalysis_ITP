		<content>  The boredom of country life in the   
 18th and 19th centuries was broken by 
 the fairs,which where held at stated  
 intervals in the various villages.The 
 best known fairs around CARNMONEY,were
 held at PARKGATE near Doagh and at    
{ ROUGHFORT},which was the scene of the
{"FOUR TOWNS FAIR OF CARNGRANEY" }.    
  Fairs usually continued for 3 days.  
 The 1st day was for the sale of yarns,
 linens and home bleached cloths.This  
 gradually  disappeared after a while. 
 The 2nd day was given to the sale of  
 cattle and sheep,and the 3rd day was  
 given to{AMUSEMENT}.Much good second- 
 hand clothing was aquired through     
 fairs.The fairs were also used as     
 hiring markets were girls and young   
 men of the working classes sold their 
 services to farmers.The date of the   
 ROUGHFORT fairs were:- 3rd Tuesday    
 after 12th MAY and 12th NOVEMBER.     </content>
