		<title>06HISTORY OF CULMORE AREA</title>
		<content>      This area,due to its maritime    
 position on the banks of the River    
 Foyle,is steeped on history from the  
 time of Colmcille,who sailed from     
 Derry 563.AD, along this part of the  
 River Foyle,on his journey to Scotland
 to the arrival of the English Lords in
 the 16th century during the Ulster    
 plantation.The old fort at Culmore    
 played an important part in Ulster    
 history and was a place of strategic  
 value in bringing about the overthrow 
 of Hugh O'Neill and so making possible
 the Ulster plantation.It is not known 
 when a fort was first built at this   
 place,but from 1559 a fort there was  
 held by the Crown,but it was later    
 lost.The Fort is believed to have been
 part of a bigger fort,built to guard  
 the entrance of L.Foyle.The fort is   
 now used as headquarters for the      
 L.Foyle yachting,sailing club.        </content>
