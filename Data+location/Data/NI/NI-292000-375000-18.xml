		<title>18ARDBOE--THE FUTURE</title>
		<content> In common with most other communities,
 The people of Ardboe have both{hopes  
{and fears}for the future.Their hopes  
 are those of any small community,good 
 housing,secure employment and so on.  
       Their fears,however,are not     
 those of most small communities.The   
 reason for this is the deposits of    
{LIGNITE}which have been discovered    
 throughout the area.                  
      If this Lignite exists in        
 sufficient quantities,then commercial 
{mining}would be most likely.The type  
 of open-cast mining,which would       
 follow,would undoubtably be the death 
 knell of this community.              
     This concern is shown by a        
 committee which has been formed by    
 residents of the area to combat such  
 an eventuality.Other residents have   
 expressed their fears in other ways   
 as the following verses show.         </content>
