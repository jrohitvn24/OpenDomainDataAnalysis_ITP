		<title>02TOWNLANDS OUTSIDE NEWRY</title>
		<content> Townlands were the means used to      
 identify small areas in rural Ireland.
 Postcodes have now been introduced and
 individual houses have been given     
 numbers to speed up mail distribution.
 This modern system of identifying     
 households has now become so          
 widespread that the townland names    
 have virtually become obsolete.  With 
 the disappearance of the townlands    
 part of our heritage is being lost.   
 The many small country roads have been
 given names for administrative        
 purposes but locals are holding       
 tenaciously to the townlands and some 
 are even refusing to use postcodes as 
 they feel the new system too          
 impersonal.  The local townlands are: 
 Cloghogue, Killeen, Upper Fathom,     
 Lower Fathom, Fathom Line, Mullavat,  
 Aughnamoira, Carrogs and Greenan.
