		<content> MY DADDY GOES TO OUR LOCAL MARKET IN  
 KILREA ON WEDNESDAY OF EVERY WEEK.IT  
 IS 5 MILES AWAY. SOMETIMES HE TAKES   
 CATTLE AND PIGS TO SELL AND SOMETIMES 
 HE JUST GOES TO BUY SMALL CALVES TO   
 REER UP INTO BEEF CATTLE.THE          
 AUCTIONEER                            
  TALKS VERY QUICKLY WHEN HE           
 IS SELLING ANIMALS. IT TAKES A WHILE  
 TO UNDER STAND WHAT HE IS SAYING.     
 WHEN MY DADDY SEES A CALF IF HE LIKES 
 IT HE WILL PUT UP HIS FINGER OR WINKS 
 AT THE AUCTIONEER. THEN THE AUCTIONEER
 KNOWS THAT HE IS INTERESTED IN BUYING 
 THE ANIMAL. THE PERSON WHO IS SELLING 
 THE ANIMAL WAITS UNTIL HE IS GETTING  
 ENOUGH MONEY THEN HE PUTS THE ANIMALS 
 ON THE MARKET. THE AUCTIONEER LOOKS   
 AROUND TO SEE WHO IS HOLDING UP HIS   
 FINGER THEN HE SAYS "SOLD!"           
                                       
                                       </content>
