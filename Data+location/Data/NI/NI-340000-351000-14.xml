		<content> In our area there is a stately home   
 owned by Mr King.His family bought    
{Rademon house}in 1951 and he still    
 owns it.There are gardens around the  
 house which Mr. and Mrs. King look    
 after.There is one sunken garden.In   
 the winter it fills with 1.5 feet of  
 water.After we had gone right round   
 the place we went up to see the       
 monument erected to William Sharmon   
 Crawford.He was an MP.We went to the  
 entrance of the monument.Inside it was
 hollow and there were stalactites     
 hanging from the roof.In the yard     
 there are four houses,the Red house,  
 the White house,the Corner house and  
 the Gardener's house.Mr King does not 
 keep any animals.Instead he lets the  
 land,the houses and the stables to    
 other people.He also owns a sawmill   
 and uses most of the wood for fences  
 and posts.                            </content>
