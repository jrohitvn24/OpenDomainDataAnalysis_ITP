		<title>12WHAT JOBS PEOPLE DO</title>
		<content> There are many different jobs that    
 people do around our area.There is    
 fishing, farming, building, factories 
 and engineering.                      
 More men work than women in our area.A
 third of the people working are women.
 Most of these work in the fish        
 factory, offices and shops.           
 Most of the men are employed on farms,
 fishing and granite works, or work    
 connected to those.                   
 Those people who are in business      
 usually travel to the city of         
 Belfast, Kilkeel and Newry, as there  
 are no business premises in the       
 area.The only professional work in the
 area is teaching,but none of these    
 teachers live in Annalong.            
 Approximately 29% of the people in our
 area are unemployed.Of these 80% are  
 men.
