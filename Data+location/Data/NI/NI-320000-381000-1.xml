 We've thoroughly researched our block.
 Our first thoughts?-"What a bore!"    
 For it seemed to us that all we had   
 Were green fields,fresh air-no more!  
                                       
 But as we walked and talked and wrote 
 It soon became quite clear,           
 There were many points of interest    
 Which some might like to hear.        
                                       
 And so,while not a masterpiece,       
 Our thoughts we want to share.        
 About our school,our farms,our lives. 
 Things old,things new,things rare.    
                                       
 Welcome to Loanends and round about.  
 Take time to find out more.           
 You'll find perhaps some little gem   
 Hidden within this store.
