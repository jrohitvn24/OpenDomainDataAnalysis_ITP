		<content> Killyleagh Harbour, a central feature 
 of the town, is owned by the company  
 of James Morrow who are local coal    
 importers.  Until August 1984 a boat  
 arrived monthly from England to unload
 coal at the quay.  It has now proved  
 more economical for the company to    
 bring the coal by road from other     
 ports such as Newry in Co.Down.       
 However the harbour is well serviced  
 and this facility is still available  
 should it prove necessary for the     
 original system of coal importation to
 re-commence.  Since there is adequate 
 pilotage in Strangford lough, and with
 the use of modern shallow draught     
 boats, the company is exploring the   
 possibility of exporting quarry stones
 from local quarries such as Ballygowan
 to London and the United Kingdom in   
 general from The Harbour at           
 Killyleagh.                           </content>
