		<content>{What it is like to live in Camphill}  
 Camphill is a very peaceful place in  
 which to live. It is quiet and        
 safe.Children can play safely as there
 is a play area of grass close to the  
 houses.  The neighbours are very      
 friendly and would always do you a    
 good turn.  We have a reliable milk   
 man,two men who deliver lemonade each 
 week,a bread man and also a mobile    
 shop. Camphill is a very good area for
 families to live as it is well served 
 by three schools. Camphill Primary    
 School,  Ballee Primary School and    
 Ballee High School are all            
 conveniently placed to our houses.    
 There is a small shop where we can buy
 sweets and groceries; things we like  
 to eat.Evening activities are well    
 catered for with classes at Ballee    
 High School, and Girls' and Boys'     
 Brigades at Ballee Presbyterian Church</content>
