		<content> DURING THE EARLY 1960'S THE LOCAL     
 CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ORGANISED A PRAWN 
 FESTIVAL.  IT CENTRED AT THE HARBOUR  
 AND WAS LINKED WITH THE FISHING       
 INDUSTRY.  IN 1976 IT WAS RENAMED THE 
 KINGDOM OF MOURNE FESTIVAL.  THIS     
 FESTIVAL WHICH WAS ORGANISED BY THE   
 RECENTLY FORMED NEWRY AND MOURNE      
 DISTRICT COUNCIL WAS TO BE A MUCH     
 BIGGER EVENT THAN ITS PREDECESSOR.    
 TO DATE, IT IS ONE OF FOUR SUMMER     
 FESTIVALS RUN BY THE COUNCIL, THE     
 OTHERS BEING THE CANAL FESTIVAL IN    
 NEWRY, GALA WEEK IN WARRENPOINT AND   
 THE SOUTH ARMAGH FESTIVAL.            
                                       
                                       
 THE AIM OF THE FESTIVAL IS TO PROMOTE 
 THE LOCAL AREA AS A TOURIST RESORT AND
 ENCOURAGE BOTH THE RESIDENTS AND      
 VISITORS TO TAKE PART IN THE ORGANISED
 EVENTS.                               </content>
