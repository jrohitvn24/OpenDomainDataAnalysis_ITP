		<content> IN  MY SPARE TIME I LIKE TO PLAY HIDE 
 AND SEEK.THIS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE    
 MANY GOOD HIDING PLACES WITH LIVING ON
 FARM.I ALWAYS PLAY WITH MY YOUNGER    
 SISTER                                
 SUZANNE AND FRIENDS WHO ARE VISITING. 
 TOGETHER WE ALSO USUALLY PLAY TIG OR  
 HOPSCOTCH AND SOMETIMES CARD GAMES    
 LIKE                                  
 SNAP OR JACK DRAWES. IF IT IS WET DAY 
 THEN I PREFER TO STAY INDOORS SUZANNE 
 AND I MIGHT PLAY HUNGARY HIPPOS OR    
 CONNECT FOUR.I LIKE CONNECT FOUR BEST 
 AS YOU HAVE TO OUT WHIT YOUR OPPONENT 
 INTO MAKING A LINE WITH YOUR COUNTER  
 EITHER VERTICALLY OR                  
 HORIZONTALY.HUNGARY HIPPOS IS A GAME  
 WHICH EITHER TWO TO FOUR PEOPLE CAN   
 PLAY. THE IDEA OF THIS GAME IS TO SEE 
 WHICH HIPPO CAN EAT THE MOST SMALL    
 WHITE BALLS BY PRESSING ON ITS BACK SO
 THAT ITS MOUTH OPENS.                 </content>
