		<title>09Tourism in Killyleagh.</title>
		<content> Killyleagh has several tourist        
 attractions as well as the Yachting.  
 The town, rises up from the harbour to
 a hill on which is built a magnificent
 castle which dates back to Norman     
 times. Architecturally,it is perhaps  
 the most important feature in the town
 and is usually the building most      
 people remember when they speak of    
 Killyleagh.It is privately owned by   
 the Rowan-Hamilton family and is only 
 open to the public by arrangement with
 Colonel Rowan-Hamilton since it is his
 private residence and he also farms   
 some 240 acres in the area.           
  Just outside the castle grounds is   
 the commemorative stone for{Hans      
{Sloane}whose library, collection of   
 botanical specimens and manuscripts   
 formed the basis of the National      
 Museum.                               
                                       </content>
