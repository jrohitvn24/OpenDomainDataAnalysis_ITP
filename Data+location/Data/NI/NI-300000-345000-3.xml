		<title>03   Tandragee's Name</title>
		<content>  Tandragee comes from the Irish Toin  
 re gaoith and means{'back to the      
{wind'.}This seeems a favourite name   
 for small hills in Ireland and there  
 are ten townlands named Tanderagee    
 (all in the Ulster counties apart from
 one in Meath and one in Kildare).     
  On old documents Tandragee was spelt 
 as Tawntaglee, Ton_le_aglee,          
 Tontlegee, Tamplacclaid and Tonerigie.
 There has  been quite a debate as to  
 how exactly it should be spelt even   
 today.                                
  The difference in spelling tells us a
 little about the people who lived in  
 Tandragee, the local people said {    
{'Tan_der_a_gee'}but in the 1800's the 
 English people at the castle spoke    
 with a different accent and pronounced
 it as {'Tandragee'}.
