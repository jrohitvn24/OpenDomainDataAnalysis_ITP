		<content> Each year we have a civic week.It     
 begins on the 27th July and ends on   
 the 4th August.On the first night     
 there is a fancy dress.This year I    
 dressed up as a groom and went with my
 friend Laura as bride and groom.The   
 childrens competition was won by my   
 friend Nancy who went covered in wool 
 and called double knitting.There are  
 floats by different associations.The  
 best float this year was of a hospital
 they had patients and nurses.We have  
 discos to pick 1 Civic Queen and 4    
 Princesses a young Miss and Master    
 Crumlin plus a Mini Queen.We also have
 a competition for the best kept garden
 and another for the best shop window.A
 very popular item is the childrens    
 sports day although 2 races are for   
 the mums and dads.In 1984{MICKY       
{MARLEY'S ROUNDABOUT}came to the       
 community centre for our party.       </content>
