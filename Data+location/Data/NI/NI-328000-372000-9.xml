		<title>09  Black Mountain Quarry</title>
		<content>   On the Black Mountain is situated a 
{quarry}which is owned by Lagan's White
 Mountain Quarries.From here the       
{Department of the Environment}and     
 building contractors get the rocks and
 stones of various sizes which are     
 needed for the construction of roads, 
 houses and other buildings.The        
 travelling people also go to this     
 quarry to buy bitmac for surfacing    
 paths or driveways.                   
  {Blasting}for{basalt}first began here
 in 1953. At that time 6 quarry-men and
 4 lorry- drivers were employed.Now in 
 1985 there are 40-45 quarry-men and 25
 lorry-drivers.The working at the rock 
 face has made a great impact on the   
{environment}so the D.O.E.has requested
 that the quarry should be{landscaped  
 and a start has been made already on  
 this.
