		<title>06Shopping  in  Dundonald</title>
		<content> We asked 130 children in our school   
 about their families' shopping habits.
 Most people shop in a supermarket,    
 going once a week, by car,normally on 
 Friday although Saturday and Thursday 
 are also popular.The majority of      
 people want convenience and value from
 a shop and they tend to shop          
 locally and often remain loyal to the 
 one shop.Usually mother does the      
 shopping and she tends to buy fresh   
 foods but be tempted by bargains.We   
 discovered that most shoppers pay by  
 cash and prefer selfservice to counter
 service.Overall the                   
 bigest stores were thought to sell the
 freshest food probably because of     
 their quick turnover.Recently a new   
 supermarket Wellworth, has opened.60% 
 of the people in Dundonald shop there 
 and it employs 70 full and            
 80 part time  staff.                  </content>
