		<content>    In Ballywalter there was once a    
 cinema but the T.V. and videos have   
 become more popular. Now there are    
 hardly any cinemas anywhere. There is 
 none in Newtownards and Bangor. The   
 nearest is Belfast.                   
    There are sometimes discos for     
 children in the halls and music in the
 pubs for adults. There is sometimes   
 dancing for men and women in the      
 church hall.                          
    We are lucky in Ballywalter because
 we are very close to the sea. If it is
 a good day you could go down to the   
 seaside and play about in the sand or 
 you could go into the sea and play in 
 a rowing boat or dinghy or just swim. 
 You can also lie down and relax and   
 sunbathe. Some people from the caravan
 sites water-ski.
