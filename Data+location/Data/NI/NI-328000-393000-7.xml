		<title>07POPULATION AND HOUSING</title>
		<content>    There is not a large  population in
 this area  because most of the land is
 used for {agriculture}. Therefore  the
 majority  of the  population  live  in
 farmhouses.The rest of the  population
 live in and around the small  villages
 of{Ballynure and Ballyeaston.         
   {Ballynure  is  the  larger  village
 with two small housing developments on
 the Lismenary Road. One is the {Downey
{Bungalows }which was  built during the
 1950's  and the  other is {Toberdowney
 which is a recent development of semi-
 detached private bungalows.           
   {Ballyeaston}has changed very little
 over the years, only a small number of
 houses having  been  built  around the
 village. The  first  small development
 on the Lower  Ballyboley Rd. is called
{Dickeystown}and has  16 houses. On the
 Trenchhill Rd., at the top of the Main
 St., 10 new bungalows have been built.</content>
