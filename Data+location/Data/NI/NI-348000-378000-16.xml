		<title>16THE RESERVOIR AT CONLIG</title>
		<content> Conlig old treatment works has a      
 catchment of 397 acres. There are 2   
 sections of water. The low level one  
 is man_made,holding 17 million gallons
 and being 15 feet high when full. The 
 high level reservoir holds 28 million 
 gallons. The water is received from   
 the Mourne Conduit at Carryduff to a  
 small reservoir at Shelter Farm,from  
 where it runs by gravity to Conlig.   
 The water is cleaned by sand          
 filtering. 350000 gallons are passed  
 through layers of gravel and fine     
 sand. The water is put through a      
 micro_strainer,injected with lime,    
 after being chlorinated and           
 de_chlorinated. The water is measured 
 in megalitres. 1 million gallons of   
 clean water can be stored at one time.
 We should try to conserve water by    
 using it in a sensible way and not    
 wasting it.           LOUISE WINKWORTH</content>
