		<content>    The 19th and early 20th centuries  
 saw attempts at establishing the      
 weaving of linen in the area with     
 several local mills being built. These
 were shortlived and agriculture and   
 fishing remained the way of life.     
    In 1856 a National School was      
 opened in Ballymacrickett and was in  
 use till 1937 when a new school was   
 built. This was improved and extended 
 in 1969, and no longer did children   
 come to school with a few lumps of    
 turf to provide heat!                 
    The original church in             
 Ballymacrickett dates from 1760, a new
 building being erected in 1802: the   
 present day church (St,Joseph's) dates
 from 1868.
