		<title>01GENERAL SUMMARY.</title>
		<content>   Our area of Glengormley and Mallusk 
 on the outskirts of Belfast is quite  
 varied in character.  Approximately   
 25% of the area is heavily populated, 
 whereas about 50% of the area is taken
 up by farmland.  The last 25% of the  
 area is taken up by industrial estates
 and commercial propeties.  There are  
 also several large playing fields.    
   At the centre of the Glengormley    
 area the meeting of the Antrim Road,  
 Ballyclare Road and Hightown Road form
 the shopping and commercial centre of 
 the area, with many various facilities
 serving the residential area.         
   The M2 running between Belfast and  
 the West cuts our area with a large   
 intersection just to the North of     
 Glengormley.  This has helped the     
 development of the residential and    
 industrial area.  The area is         
 relatively wealthy and prosperous.{   </content>
