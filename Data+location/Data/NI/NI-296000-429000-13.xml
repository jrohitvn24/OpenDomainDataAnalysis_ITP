		<content> Local rivers are good for fishing, and
 many people fish as their hobby. As   
 well as adults, many boys and quite a 
 few girls enjoy the sport.{Worm,      
{maggot, spinner}and{fly}are the most  
 popular baits. The{River Bush,}and its
 tributary, the{Stracam,}are fished by 
 people from all over the province and 
 abroad; mainly for salmon, trout and  
 eels. A local boy recently caught 14  
 trout in 1 hour.                      
                                       
 The{Bush}is especially famous         
 for its salmon and is stocked and     
 controlled by the{Department of       
{Agriculture.}The local club is the    
{Bushmills and District Angling Club_  
 with game and coarse fishing sections.
 They have 34 fishing competions each  
 year. The club goes to fish in the    
 sea at{Portrush}or{Portstewart.}The   
 coarse fishing is at the{River Bann.  </content>
