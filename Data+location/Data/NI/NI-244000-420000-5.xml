		<title>05FISHING IN CULMORE AREA</title>
		<content>     Fishing on the River Foyle is     
 prominent during the summer months but
 goes on all year round.At each tide   
 the hauls of salmon are taken to Ice  
 House Castle at Culmore Point where   
 they are stored in freezers. On       
 average,the salmon weigh between      
 5_15lbs.There was concern last year at
 the decreasing numbers of salmon in   
 the river.At the moment there are 23  
 licensed fishing boats at Culmore     
 Point and that number is  increasing. 
 Fishing is allowed from Ture          
 Lighthouse to the River Roe,although  
 not actually on the rivers.Until      
 recently,the Foyle Area Driftnet      
 Fishermens Association boats,could    
 fish from 7am to 5pm,but they are now 
 restricted to fishing from 7pm to     
 midnight.However neighbouring         
 fisheries can fish 24 hours a day.
