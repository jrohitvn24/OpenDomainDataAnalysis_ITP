		<content> There are three main roads which are  
 apparent,the rest of the area being   
 supplied by numerous small roadways   
 and lanes. The main roads(Class B) are
 well sign posted,but after travelling 
 throughout the area it is plain to see
 that most others are in poor          
 condition, some are dangerous.        
   In the area several new houses have 
 reciently been built.Namely small     
 stretches of 6 to 10 detatched houses 
 or bungalows along the Portglenone    
 Road,Ahoghill Road and Coolsythe Road.
   Apart from these few areas the rest 
 of the region is a typical scattered  
 farming community, with little or no  
 amenities and no "focal point" either 
 physical or social towards which the  
 local population might be drawn.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
