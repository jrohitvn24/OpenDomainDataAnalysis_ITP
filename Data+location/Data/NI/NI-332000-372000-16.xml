		<title>16THE GRAND OPERA HOUSE</title>
		<content> Recently I had the privilege of acting
 with a Travelling Company from Cardiff
 in one of the most beautiful theatres 
 in Britain,The Grand Opera House,     
 Belfast.It was restored in 1980 to its
 former glory at a cost of over one    
 million pounds.Before The Opera House 
 was damaged by a terrorist explosion  
 it was used chiefly as a cinema,but   
 since its restoration it has been used
 exclusively as a theatre.In the past  
 few years it has played host to many  
 different kinds of entertainments,such
 as ballet,operas,drama,orchestras and 
 solo entertainers.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
