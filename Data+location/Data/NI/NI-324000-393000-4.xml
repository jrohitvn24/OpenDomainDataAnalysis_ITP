		<content>    Most  farms  are fairly small(30-60
 hectares) and run by the family. A few
 employ an additional farm worker.     
    Most land is under  grass with some
 winter and spring  cereals being grown
 chiefly {BARLEY}.   Several   hectares
 of {POTATOES}are also grown anually . 
    1985  will  be  remembered  as  the
 wettest summer on record . Very little
 hay was saved and great difficulty was
 experienced in  obtaining  the  second
 cut of silage . Some  of the fields of
 cereals were  so  wet that they  could
 not be harvested{FARMING}is difficult!
  { LIVESTOCK}prices have also suffered
 and many farmers had  to  house  their
 livestock much  earlier  than  usual .
 Beef cattle would  comprise  the major
 enterprise with a little dairying  and
 some sheep and pigs . One poultry unit
 supplying hatching eggs is  found   in
 the area.                             </content>
