		<title>08Larne Harbour</title>
		<content> The harbour which is the second       
 busiest in Northern Ireland, is owned 
 privately by European Ferries.        
 It can be entered at any state of the 
 tide.                                 
 Most of the traffic is roll on/roll   
 off, a service that was developed     
 after the 1939-45 war,using ships that
 had formerly transported military     
 equipment.                            
 There are three services from Larne   
 Harbour. SEALINK connects to          
 Stranraer ,TOWNSEND THORESEN to       
 Cairnryan, and P&amp;O FERRIES go to      
 Fleetwood.                            
 During the peak travelling periods    
 there are six sailings to Cairnryan,  
 eight to Stranraer and one to         
 Fleetwood daily. The Fleetwood sailing
 is dependent on the state of the tide 
 on the other side of the channel.
