		<content> School in those days started at nine  
 and ended at three.One had to bring a 
 lunch because there were no dinners.  
 You also had to bring some turf for   
 the fire and if you did not bring any 
 you would have to sit at the back of  
 the classroom away from the heat.One  
 would learn to read and write.The     
 children had quill pens to write with 
 and counting_frames to add with.The   
 rules were very strict until all the  
 work was done by hand.One had to walk 
 to school.Most of the schools were in 
 the country.                          
 Now schools are becoming computerised 
 and children from this area attend    
 grammar and secondary schools in      
 Enniskillen.There are up to 700 pupils
 attending some of these schools.      
 Food during those years was indeed    
 very plain.Diet consisted mainly of   
 potatoes,buttermilk,salt and raw onion</content>
