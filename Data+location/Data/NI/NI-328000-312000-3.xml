		<content> PELAGIC MEANS IT FISHES WITH ITS NET  
 CLEAR OF THE SEA BED AND CAN RAISE OR 
 LOWER THE NET WHERE NECESSARY. THEY   
 CATCH MAINLY HAKE AND COD AND ALL     
 TYPES OF WHITE FISH.                  
                                       
 PRAWN BOATS ARE BETWEEN 50 AND 70 FEET
 LONG AND HAVE A SMALLER ENGINE THAN   
 PELAGIC BOATS.  AS INDICATED BY THEIR 
 NAME THEY FISH MAINLY FOR PRAWNS AND  
 HAVE A CREW OF FIVE INCLUDING THE     
 SKIPPER.  A FULLY RIGGED PRAWN NET    
 COSTS ABOUT Â£1,000, WHICH IS CHEAP    
 WHEN COMPARED TO THE Â£25,000 COST OF A
 MID WATER TRAWL NET USED IN A PELAGIC 
 TRAWLER.  BOTH THE PELAGIC TRAWLER AND
 THE PRAWN BOATS FISH MAINLY IN THE    
 IRISH SEA AND RETURN HOME AFTER EACH  
 DAY'S FISHING.                        
 THE TWO LARGEST BOATS IN THE FLEET ARE
 CALLED THE SPES MAGNA AND THE         
 STEPHENS.                             </content>
