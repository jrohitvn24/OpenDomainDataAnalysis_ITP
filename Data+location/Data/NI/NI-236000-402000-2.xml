		<content> FIFTY YEARS AGO THE FOYLE, WITH THE   
 STRABANE CANAL,WAS A VERY IMPORTANT   
 MEANS OF TRANSPORTING HEAVY GOODS TO  
 AND FROM THE PORT OF DERRY. IN THE    
 NINETEENTH CENTURY THE CHANNEL WAS    
 KEPT CLEAR BY THE REMOVAL OF SAND     
 WHICH WAS USED AS BALLAST ON THE      
 EMIGRANT SHIPS FROM DERRY TO AMERICA, 
 THEN USED ON BUILDING SITES ON LONG   
 ISLAND,NEW YORK.SADLY,TODAY, THE RIVER
 IS SILTING UP AND MANY SMALL ISLANDS  
 ARE FORMING IN THE MAIN CHANNEL.THE   
 DENNETT AND GLENMORNAN BURN,          
 TRIBUTARIES OF THE FOYLE SUPPLIED     
 WATER POWER FOR QUITE A FEW SMALL     
 INDUSTRIES IN THE AREA,_CORN MILLS, A 
 MAIL BAG FACTORY AND FURTHER SOUTH A  
 PAPER MILL.TODAY THE FOYLE AND IT'S   
 TRIBUTARIES ARE IMPORTANT ONLY FOR    
 FISHING AND WATER SUPPLY,THEIR BEAUTY 
 SPOILED BY INDISCRIMINATE DUMPING OF  
 LITTER.                               </content>
