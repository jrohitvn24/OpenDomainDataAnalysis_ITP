		<content> When I arrive home from school during 
 the week at about 3.45pm. I change    
 into casual clothes and,when I have   
 done some light chores for my mother,I
 begin my {homework}which was set in   
 school.                               
                                       
 We have our{evening meal}at 6.00pm.   
 and afterwards I pack my bags with the
 books I will need for school the next 
 day. Later in the evening I practice  
 my piano music and then join my       
 friends in a local{Recreation}Area.   
                                       
 Home life and social life foe me is   
 very pleasant. Lastly,after watching {
{television}for a short time Igo to    
 bed.                                  
                                       
 Weekends are more relaxing,with more  
 time for my friends and family. We go 
 to Church on Sunday.                  </content>
