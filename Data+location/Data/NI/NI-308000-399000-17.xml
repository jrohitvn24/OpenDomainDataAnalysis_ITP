		<title>17A Day In My Life</title>
		<content>   I normally get up at half past      
 seven and get dressed.About eight     
 o'clock I get my breakfast of Frosties
 and milk.then I pack my schoolbag and 
 get my bus money ready.At half past   
 eight my friend Sheran and I walk up  
 to the bus stop.The bus comes around  
 ten to nine.School starts at 9.15a.m. 
 and continues until 3.l0 p.m. In the  
 morning we do spellings,Religious     
 Education, mental arithmetic and      
 mathematics. We have a ten minute     
 break during the morning. After break 
 we do English, Geography, Natural     
 Science or History. As a member of the
 school choir we meet every            
 Wednesday afternoon. About two        
 o'clock, as a school prefect, I help  
 escort the primary children to the    
 school bus. The school day ends at ten
 past three.
