		<title>11 CLUB (Clay pigeon shoot)</title>
		<content>    The "Chestnut" Clay Pigeon Club was
 founded in 1975 and at present has 50 
 members at an annual fee of Â£5.00.    
    Meetings of the Committee are held 
 every 3 weeks to organise events. A   
 shoot is held at the Chestnut Inn     
 every fortnight on Saturday p.m. and  
 usually about 40 guns comp@ete for    
 trophies and cash prizes. Annual      
 shoots as part of Glenavy Civic Week  
 in June, and Crumlin Civic Week in    
 July are also held. Charity shoots are
 also held for agreed charities.       
    The only lady involved, Mrs.       
 M.Mulholland, does invaluable work at 
 the shoots, collecting fees and       
 keeping detailed accounts of scores.  
    An Annual Dinner is held in        
 February to show that wives and girl  
 friends are not forgotten in this     
 predominantly male sport.
