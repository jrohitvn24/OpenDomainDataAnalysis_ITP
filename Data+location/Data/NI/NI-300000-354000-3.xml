		<content> Most of the firms are small,local     
 companies which can grow and adapt to 
 the changing market.Efforts have also 
 been made to attract National and     
 International concerns.               
     There is quite a high             
 diversification of industry including{
{electrical;food engineering,storage   
{and freezing;bottling                 
{plants;and plastics works.}           
      Also in the area there is an     
 office for Health Service             
 administration,a depot for Northern   
 Ireland Carriers,a Vehicle Inspection 
 and Driving Test Centre and an area   
 office for the Northern Ireland       
 Electricity Service.

 services and also gives an outlet for 
 many of the products manufactured and 
 distributed.
