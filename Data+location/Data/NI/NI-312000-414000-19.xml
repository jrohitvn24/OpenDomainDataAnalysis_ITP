		<content>{"Its your turn McIlhatton, when you   
{have knocked the door, hide behind    
{that old wooden stub."}I knocked the  
 door, scampered up the steps to my    
 hiding place. Out came the owner of   
 the house. When he found nobody       
 there he soon realised some body was  
 playing the{joker.}He walked up the   
 steps at a slow pace crouching his    
 head over the hedge and staring. His  
{eyes burned with anger}and lit up the 
{expression on his face.}Mean-while I  
 was hidden and sitting as still as    
 stillness wondering what would happen.
 The old man got over the hedge and    
 began to nose around. He was getting  
 closer,{I could   feel the shadow of  
{him behind me,}I wasn't waiting any   
 longer, up I got, over the hedge, home
 was my destination.{"Get out of here  
{before I fell you"}I didn't wait to be
 told a second time.                   </content>
