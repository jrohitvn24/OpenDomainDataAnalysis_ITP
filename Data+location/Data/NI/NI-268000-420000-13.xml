		<title>13THE AMBULENCE DRIVER</title>
		<content> My daddy is the Leading Ambulance     
 Driver at the Roe Valley Hospital.  He
 seems to have two different jobs.     
 When he is "On Clinics" his job is to 
 drive round to different people's     
 houses and collect them to attend the 
 out-patients clinic at Altnagelvin    
 Hospital in Derry, which is about 16  
 miles away.  Sometimes he is "On Call"
 which means if there is an accident   
 during the night he has to rush first 
 into the town to collect his          
 ambulance.  That's because we live in 
 the country and that slows him down a 
 lot.  On Thursdays he always gets off 
 work early because the ambulances in  
 Limavady do not go out that day. So   
 don't get knocked down in Limavady on 
 a Thursday because if you do the      
 ambulance will have to come from Derry
 which is a long way to come.
