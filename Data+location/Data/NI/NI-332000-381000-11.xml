		<content>       {Milibern House}is a "sheltered 
 dwelling " complex comprising 16 flats
 which house 24 elderly people mostly  
 ex-servicemen and/or their wives.     
        There are both single and      
 double flats. The rent for a single is
 Â£16.18 per fortnight and a double     
 Â£20.48. These flats are almost fully  
 furnished for the residents.          
        A warden lives on the site in a
 house of her own. Her main role is to 
 oversee the well-being of the         
 residents. Each flat is linked to her 
 home by an alarm system.              
        Included in the complex is a   
 communal lounge and a sports room.    
        Milibern House is a place where
 old-age pensioners can retain their   
 independence and yet live with the    
 comfort and assurance that help is    
 close at hand if it is needed. We     
 really enjoyed our visit there.       </content>
