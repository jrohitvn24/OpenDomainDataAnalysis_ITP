		<title>17SPORT IN COAGH VILLAGE</title>
		<content> Sporting activities play their part in
 village life. The Presbyterian Church 
 and the Church of Ireland have very   
 active{indoor bowling clubs}and the   
 River Ballinderry provides excellent{ 
{coarse}and{trout fishing}for the local
 and visiting anglers.                 
   Over the years{soccer}has been an   
 abiding passion and it would seem that
 the village has always had a team and 
 has produced some outstanding players 
 who have gone on to play for Irish    
 League Teams. Twenty five years ago   
 Sam Creighton, a local man, was capped
 as goalkeeper for the{Irish Amateur   
{International Team. }                 
   The{village team,Coagh United,}which
 has been playing on a pitch kindly    
 lent by the Duff family has realized  
 the ambition of owning its own pitch: 
 the cost met by a grant, subscriptions
 and fund raising activities.          </content>
