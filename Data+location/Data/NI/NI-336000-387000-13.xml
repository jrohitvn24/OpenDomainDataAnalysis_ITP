		<title>13RUGBY IN CARRICKFERGUS.</title>
		<content> It is assumed that the Rugby Club was 
 formed in 1865 by military personnel  
 attached to the castle. In the period 
 1910 - 1912 they were one of the      
 strongest Junior clubs in Ulster. In  
 the l950's they had three teams but by
 l960 they were fielding 6 teams       
 regularly and won the Towns'Cup twice.
 In l976 they started "Mini-Rugby"     
 which involves boys under eleven      
 making up a team of seven and using   
 simple rugby rules.  The Club's       
 greatest success was in reaching the  
 final of the Ulster Senior Cup in     
 1983.  Changing facilities in the     
 earlier days was one small hut with   
 one shower, up to the present they    
 have six changing areas with showers. 
      A new club house was opened in   
 1971 and squash courts were added in  
 1977.  The l985 valuation of their    
 facilities is Â£250,000.               </content>
