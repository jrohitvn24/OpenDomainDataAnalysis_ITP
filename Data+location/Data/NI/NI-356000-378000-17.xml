		<title>17TRANSPORT DONAGHADEE</title>
		<content> Transport is very important to        
 Donaghadee because so many of its     
 residents must travel to work,        
 schools, shopping and leisure centres.
                                       
 There is a regular{bus service}to     
 Belfast, passing through Newtownards, 
 approximately every hour and a similar
 service to Bangor which connects with 
 the N.I. Railway Service.             
                                       
 Many residents find the public        
 transport provision inadequate for    
 their needs and resort to using       
{private cars.}This leaves the         
 bus services predominantly the domain 
 of the young and the old.             
                                       
 Although there is a harbour, there is 
 no longer any passenger or cargo      
 transport to or from the town.
