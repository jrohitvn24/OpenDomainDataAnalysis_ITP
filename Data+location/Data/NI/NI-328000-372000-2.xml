		<title>02    New Hypermarket</title>
		<content> At the end of April a new{Hypermarket 
 known as the Park Centre was opened on
 the site of what was once one of      
 Belfast's most famous football        
 grounds, and until recently its most  
 famous{greyhound}track, Celtic Park.  
   In recent years a number of         
 hypermarkets have opened in the       
 suburbs of Belfast but this is the    
 first to serve this area of the city  
 and is the closest yet to the         
 'downtown' shopping area. It is       
 strategically situated close to the   
 most important road junction in the   
 city where the West Link links the M1 
{motorway}running south and the M2     
 running north out of the city.        
   As well as offering increased       
 shopping opportunities it is providing
 several hundred jobs in an area of    
 high{unemployment.}
