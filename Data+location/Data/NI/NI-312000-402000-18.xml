		<content>{LOCAL HISTORY  }The earliest records  
 of the area came in 480 when early    
 Christian communities were founded at 
 Connor(5 miles S.E. of B'mena) &amp; at   
 nearby Kirkinriola.                   
        There is evidence to indicate a
 Danish and Norman presence in the     
 area.During their campaign, the       
 Normans built great mounds of earth   
 topped by wooden towers,_the remains  
 of one of these moats and baileys is  
 found close to M.2. motorway on Larne 
 Rd.3 raths are also found in the area.
        This area was in the hands of  
 the O'Neill's of Clandeboye by 1264.  
 James 1 granted this land to Rory Oge 
 McQuillan in 1607. It passed through  
 the hands of several owners before    
 coming into the possession of William 
 Adair in 1626. The area, and          
 particularly the town, prospered under
 this wealthy family.                  </content>
