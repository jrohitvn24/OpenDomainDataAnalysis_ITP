		<content> Pellipar House,on the outskirts of    
 Dungiven,dates back to the Plantation 
 of Ulster when the O'Cahan clan were  
 dispossessed of their lands and these 
 were given to the London Companies to 
 administer.Pellipar House was a sort  
 of fortified farmhouse built by the   
 London Company of Skinners and leased 
 to the Plantation family of Ogilby who
 became the predominant landlords in   
 the Dungiven area.The house is a fine 
 example of an Ulster Plantation estate
 and although renovations to the House 
 have not been in keeping with the     
 original design,it still represents a 
 fairly complete picture of an Ulster  
 "bawn".The house is now occupied by   
 local farmer Mr.Roland Henry who farms
 about 400 acres of the estate beside  
 the River Roe.
