		<title>02170 ACRE FARM.</title>
		<content>   On one 170 acre farm we visited the 
 farmer keeps 200 dairy cows, 120 beef 
 cattle and 80 young stock. He has four
 full time helpers and he takes on a   
 temporary worker each summer.         
  Milking starts each morning at 6 a.m.
 and ends at 8.30 a.m. In the afternoon
 milking starts at 3.30 p.m. and       
 finishes at 6 p.m. The milking parlour
 has 24 stalls. Twelve cows are milked 
 at one time, while the other twelve   
 cows are being washed and prepared.   
  Each cow gives an average of 5,000   
 litres of milk a year. The tanker from
 the local creamery calls each morning.
  The outer fields are used for growing
 silage. Cutting started on the twelth 
 of May. It will be cut every 6 weeks. 
 The farmer is aiming for three cuts   
 for his winter fodder.
