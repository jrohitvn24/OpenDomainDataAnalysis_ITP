		<content> It is a mixed farming area with       
 emphasis on cattle rearing, dairy     
 farming and crops such as barley,     
 wheat and a few acres in potatoes.    
 There are a few large dairy farms.    
 Glen Mills Dairy on the Banbridge Road
 put the milk in cartons and sell it   
 around to householders, local shops   
 and large chain stores. Most of the   
 farms are very large, some exceeding  
 100 acres. A lot of silage is cut     
 during late May and early June. Little
 hay is now made in the summer. Milk is
 collected by tankers from the various 
 farms and brought to Creamline Dairy, 
 Lurgan. Cattle are mostly sold at     
 livestock markets in Markethill and   
 Lurgan.
