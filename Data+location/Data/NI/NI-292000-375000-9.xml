		<title>09ARDBOE FISHING COMMUNITY</title>
		<content> Our ways of fishing haven't changed   
 very much over the years but we today 
 find it much easier to make a good    
 living than in times gone by. We live 
 in{modern houses}and in some cases the
 members of our family are raising     
 their own families in new houses close
 to their parents' home. It is nice to 
 be able{to live close together}like   
 this because the produce of the lough 
 can support all these families in     
 comfort.                              
     As well as this open water fishing
 our men, being members of the CO-OP   
 take part in the{fixed trap fishing   
 where the Lower Bann river leaves the 
 Lough at Toome.Here the{silver eels   
 (mature fish with silver undersides)  
 migrating back to the Sargasso are    
 captured in tons,during the autumn    
 floods,when the moon is dark.These    
 fish have an even higher market value.</content>
