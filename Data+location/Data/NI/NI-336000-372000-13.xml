		<title>13Renovation</title>
		<content> Our terrace house is fifty years old  
 being a pre-war house. Before being   
 renovated it had two bedrooms,a living
 room and a kitchen. When we moved in  
 the house was cold, smelly and damp.  
 The people before us did not have a   
 bathroom. They just had a tin bath    
 which they had left behind when we    
 moved in. I used to get bathed in it. 
 The renovation made a lot of changes. 
 The yard was made smaller because we  
 got a bathroom extension as did about 
 21 houses out of 95 being renovated.  
 Some people got a bedroom on top of   
 their bathroom. One woman had her     
 attic opened up and a window put in.  
 Now it is a games room. Now most of   
 the houses have new Parkray fires     
 which heat the water and central      
 heating. I like my house as it is warm
 and cosy and it is near the park, the 
 play centre and leisure centre.       </content>
