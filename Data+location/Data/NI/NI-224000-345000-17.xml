		<content> The landscape in this area is a       
 mixture of urban and rural sights.In  
 the urban part there is mainly housing
 and some social services and          
 factories. In the rural area farming  
 is the main form of employment and    
 there are lots of open fields which   
 make_up the landscape.                
 If you stand on top of Garvary and    
 look at the landscape you will see    
 that it is mainly covered in          
 grass(except at the bottom of the     
 drumlins where rushes grow),and the   
 fields are very small and are bordered
 by high hedges.                       
 The rural landscape is mostly made_up 
 of drumlins.Drumlins are small hills  
 made of boulder clay.They were formed 
 thousands of years ago when the whole 
 area was covered with ice;as the ice  
 moved it picked_up clay and rocks     
 (anything in its path)                </content>
