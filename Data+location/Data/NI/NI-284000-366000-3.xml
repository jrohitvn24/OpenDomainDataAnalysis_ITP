 The first family celebration in our   
 lives was our{Christening or Baptism. 
 This is a religious ceremony where the
 newborn baby is admitted to the       
{Catholic Church.}The ceremony usually 
 takes place two to three weeks after  
 birth. The baby is dressed in a long  
 white robe and wrapped in a shawl.    
 He is brought to the church by his    
 parents, godparents and other members 
 of the family.Godparents are the      
 people who make the promises that the 
 baby will lead a good Christian life  
 since he is too young to make them for
 himself. The priest baptises the      
 baby with Holy Water and gives him    
 his name. After the ceremony the      
 family usually celebrate with a meal  
 either in the baby's house or in an   
 hotel.
