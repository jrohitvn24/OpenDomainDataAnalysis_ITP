		<title>08BALMORAL-KING'S HALL COMPLEX</title>
		<content> The dominating feature of this area is
 the King's Hall which provides a wide 
 variety of entertainment for the city 
 and country. The area contains many   
 low density dwellings but is gradually
 being integrated into middle to inner 
 city developments with new housing    
 schemes and a flyover on the main     
 Lisburn Road. The age of the occupants
 of the houses is reflected in the     
 closure of Malone Primary School which
 has now become a private primary      
 school serving south Belfast. In spite
 of building development in the area   
 there is still a large proportion of  
 green areas including an 18 hole Golf 
 Course. The Balmoral Complex is used  
 for Agricultural Shows and Pop        
 Concerts.
