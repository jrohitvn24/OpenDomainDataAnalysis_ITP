		<content> The {Campbells}had a small farm in the
 area. The farm house had stone walls  
 and a thatched roof.A byre, with a    
 loft, a cart_shed,a pig_sty and a hen 
 house were included in the farmyard.  
               Livestock included a    
 sturdy pony to pull the plough and the
 cart, two milking cows, a pig, some   
 sheep and poultry. These reqired      
 feeding all the year round. The pig   
 was being fattened for slaughter. Eggs
 provided an important source of       
 income.The cows were milked twice a   
 day and butter made once a week in a  
 wooden churn.                         
             Some land was cultivated  
 each year growing mainly oats and     
 potatoes but also cutting hay and     
 growing some vegetables. Potatoes     
 formed the basic diet and oats could  
 be made into bread or fed to the      
 animals.They were self-sufficient.    </content>
