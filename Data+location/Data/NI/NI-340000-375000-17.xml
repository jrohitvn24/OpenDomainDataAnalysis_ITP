		<content> Also the grass grows early in this    
 area so the cows can be put out to    
 grass early.                          
 We looked around the milking parlour, 
 went to see the calves in the barn    
 and then Mr Crawford told us how      
 silage is made from grass cut on the  
 farm. We didnt like the smell of the  
 silage but he said that the cows like 
 it very much.                         
 We went back to the farmhouse,we where
 given delicious milkshakes and were   
 allowed to play in the garden.        
 Then we drove to the top of           
 Carrowreagh hill to look at some cows 
 and a bull in the fields we had a run 
 across the fields to the Dunlady      
 Road,were the minibus met us and we   
 drove to the second unit.The milk     
 tanker arrived just after us and we   
 saw the milk being taken from the     
 big cooler.                           </content>
