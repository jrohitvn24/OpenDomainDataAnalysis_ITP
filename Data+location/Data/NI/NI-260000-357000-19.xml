		<content> Ballygawley then,is an small village  
 well serviced with good roads,good    
 shops,a beautiful new church,and      
 modern schools with St.Ciaran's High  
 School especially,being an important  
 focal point for the Catholic community
 of a wide area around the village.The 
 stardard of housing and of living     
 generally,has improved a lot during   
 the last twenty years.New bungalows   
 and houses are to be seen throughout  
 the entire area.It is a centre for the
 people of a wide area,who come for    
 shopping and entertainment.Despite its
 ideal position Ballygawley has not    
 attracted the industry that might     
 have been expected and consequently   
 unemployment and poor prospects for   
 the young are a source of concern.    
 It is in an area of excellent farmland
 with beautiful scenery especially from
 the north of the area.                </content>
