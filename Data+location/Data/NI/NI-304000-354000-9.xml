 I get up at ten to seven and          
 when we get up we have a bath and get 
 dressed. I have my breakfast. I get my
 wee brother dressed. I have to leave  
 my brother to the{Nursery.}I have     
 about five minutes to get into the    
 playground. We get into rows when     
 the bell rings. All schools have      
 books, pens, pencils, stages, and     
 rubbers. If you do a mistake you will 
 have to rub it out without making a   
 mark. But do not lean on it hard      
 because it will break.                
{SUBJECTS}                             
 Maths, Comprehension, Spelling,       
 Religion, Georaphy, Science, S.R.A,   
 handwriting. In school there are a lot
 of lessons and lots of homework. There
 are ten lessons and two for homework  
 and sometimes even no homework at all.
 In maths we get Primary Mathematics.  </content>
