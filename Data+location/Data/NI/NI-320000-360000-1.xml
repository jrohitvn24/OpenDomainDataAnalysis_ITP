		<content>  This area ,on the outskirts of {     
{Lisburn},is generally typical of most 
 rural areas but has the added         
 peculiarities of a Racecourse and a   
 prison complex.                       
 The {Maze Racecourse},covering an area
 of approximately 1 square kilometre   
 has race meetings on fourteen         
 occasions during the year,the biggest 
 of which are held during the summer   
 months.The {Maze Prison},sited on an  
 old airfield,and covering over 1      
 square kilometre, was built in the    
 late 1960's but all detailed          
 information is classified.            
 Farming is the main industry of the   
 area and is centred on crops,cattle,  
 pigs and market gardening.Within this 
 area fall the districts of Moira and  
 Maze.The {River Lagan}flows diagonally
 through the area and remnants of the  
 old Lagan Canal can still be found.   </content>
