		<content> Farms in the area are from 60 to 120  
 acres in size.Average farms would be  
 90 acres.There are only 3 or 4{dairy  
{farms}in our block.{Mixed farming}is  
 the main occupation with hay,silage,  
 kale and barley being produced to feed
 bullocks and heifers for beef.Since   
 1980 pig numbers have decreased due to
 falling prices.Sheep are widespread.  
 To produce efficient crops{fertilizers
 are liberally used.Artificial as well 
 as well as farmyard manure is applied.
{Machinery}like muck spreaders and     
 combine harvesters prevails.{Tractors}
 are more powerful every year.New cow- 
 sheds are well designed with slotted  
 floors for easier cleaning.A new grain
 drying facility exists at Clough, out-
 side our block but serving our area.In
 the north around{Drumaroad}there is a 
 shallow heavy loam while southern loam
 (medium)holds mainly Protestant farms.</content>
