		<title>07FARMING AROUND LIMAVADY</title>
		<content> There are many different kinds of     
 farms surrounding the town.  While    
 some farmers keep sheep on the local  
 mountain, the land around Limavady is 
 mainly flat and is very good for all  
 types of farming.  There are farmers  
 who keep dairy herds of cattle on the 
 green pasture land.  Vegetables, wheat
 and barley are also grown.  Nowadays  
 the farmers have lots of machinery to 
 help them with their work.  They have 
 ploughs to til and plant the seed, all
 at the one time, and they have combine
 harvesters to reap and bail the barley
 and wheat.  There are also large      
 milking parlours with electric milking
 machines.  Because the farmers have   
 all this machinery to help with their 
 work, they do not need so many people 
 to work on the farm.
