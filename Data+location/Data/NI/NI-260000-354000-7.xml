		<title>07A DAY IN A FARMERS LIFE</title>
		<content> The farmer gets up at about six-thirty
 in the morning and the first thing he 
 does is get meal for the cows. The    
 next thing he does is set up the      
 milkers and then he goes to fetch the 
 cows and starts milking.              
    While the cows are being milked he 
 feeds the calves. When all the milking
 is finished he washes the utensils and
 cools the milk. After this he would go
 for his breakfast at about eight-     
 thirty. At nine o' clock, the milk    
 tanker arrives to collect the milk to 
 be taken to the creameries. The farmer
 then has to sterilise the milk tank   
 and wash out the byre and clean up.   
    For the remainder of the day, he   
 will work in the fields perhaps       
 cutting hay or silage.                
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
