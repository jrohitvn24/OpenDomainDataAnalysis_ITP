		<title>16FARM STUDIES EAST BANGOR</title>
		<content>                                       
   The two farms we examined were      
 called Glenganagh Farm and Islet Hill 
 Farm.These were beside each other     
 about 1km to the East of Bangor.      
     The farmhouses were made up of    
 different buildings and have dogs to  
 guard them.As the fields reach right  
 to the coast the land changes to rough
 grazing there.This part is owned by   
 the National Trust.Lots of paths run  
 through it.                           
     The two farms between them have   
 about 10-12 fields.These are mostly   
 under grass for hay or grazing.Only   
 one field was planted in crops.       
     At the coast there are lots of    
 islands that seem to have been part of
 the mainland once.Some of these are   
 covered at high tide.
