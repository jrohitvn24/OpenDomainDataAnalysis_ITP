 Most old people liked living in this  
 mainly quiet area.All seemed to have  
 three main complaints about the       
 locality;                             
 1) The poor bus service into Lisburn. 
 2) The lack of a local public park of 
 any quality.                          
 3) The amount of untidiness and litter
    in the area.                       
 Most said that they were unhappy to go
 out at nights on their own, but all   
 felt that the area was pleasant enough
 to walk through during the day.       
 Lack of suitable recreational         
 facilities for older people was also  
 mentioned by many.
