		<content> This area is administered by          
 Branbridge District Council. At the   
 local elections in May 1985, Mr       
 Laurence McCartan was the only local  
 person to be elected to represent the 
 area of Knockiveagh. A local committee
 meets in Gilford to act as a pressure 
 group and to present their views to   
 the local councillors. Derelict       
 buildings in the town of Gilford and  
 district have been a problem for a    
 long time. After years of agitation   
 the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
 has begun to demolish those that are a
 danger to the population. Due to cut  
 backs in public spending, there is    
 only a part time street cleaner. An   
 Action for Community Employment scheme
 is in operation. This ACE has three   
 men doing work around the housing     
 sites to tidy up gardens and parkland.
