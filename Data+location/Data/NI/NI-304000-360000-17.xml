		<title>17The Brownies</title>
		<content>  The Brownies are part of the Girl    
 Guides Movement.Girls stay members of 
 the Brownies until they are about 12, 
 when they can become members of the   
 Guides.In order to become a Guide,the 
 girls must make three promises,to do  
 their best,to serve their country and 
 to keep the Guide Law.                
  There is a meeting for us every      
 Tuesday night from 7 to 9.There are   
 three different age groups,7-8,9-10   
 and 10-11,with about 40 members in    
 each group.                           
  St.Brigid is the patron saint of the 
 Brownies,and so we wear her cross on  
 our uniform.                          
  A holiday is arranged each year and  
 we also go camping some weekends.     
  The Brownies full name is the St.    
 Oliver Plunket Brigins of Ireland.
