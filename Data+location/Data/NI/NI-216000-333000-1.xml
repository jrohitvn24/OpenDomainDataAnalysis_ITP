 there is {Florencecourt House,}the    
 former home of the Cole family.Most of

 and on the estate.But since{1955}the  
 house has been owned by the{National  
{Trust}and is open to the public.      
  Surrounding the house there are      
{picturesque gardens}containg flowers  
 and trees such as rhodedendrons,oak,  
 sycamore,chesnut and scots pine.      
  The rest of the estate is a Forest

{Irish Yew}tree,discovered in{1767.

 farms,usually have another occupation 
 and use their land for grazing cattle 
 and sheep.The larger farms have dairy 
 herds and make hay and silage.        </content>
