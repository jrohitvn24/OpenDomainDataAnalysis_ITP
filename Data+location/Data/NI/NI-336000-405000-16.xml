		<title>16DISUSED KILNS _ BALLYGALLY</title>
		<content> 100 years ago{most farms}in this area 
 had a{small kiln for burning lime.}Few
 traces of them are left,though some   
 are still recognisable.Built on a     
{slope of local stone,2 or 3 m high,   
{they looked like a ramp on top.       
 A horse and cart filled with limestone
 rocks was backed onto the top. The    
{rocks were put into a large hole}in   
 the top. Down below a{great fire      
{burned the lime}and turned it into    
 powder. When the fire was cleaned out,
 the{lime fell to the bottom.}Down at  
 the front the farmer shovelled the    
 lime out onto the cart. Then it was   
{mixed with manure and spread over the 
{fields.}They stopped using kilns about
 the end of the 19th century as it was 
{easier and cheaper to buy it}from the 
 big{limeworks at Glenarm and Larne.}On
 O.S maps they appear as kiln (disused)
 today often{only a pile of rocks.     </content>
