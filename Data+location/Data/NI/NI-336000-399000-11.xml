		<content>{TURNIP LANTERNS.}A good sized and     
 shaped turnip is hollowed out, eyes,  
 nose and mouth cut out; a candle stuck
 inside and lit. The children carry    
 this from house to house of           
 neighbours, doing "Hallowe'en Knock". 
 They may be given a few pence.        
{Children's parties}are held, where    
 these games are played.{DUCKING.}A    
 bowl or basin is filled with water.   
 Apples, nuts and some coins are put   
 in, and the children duck for these.  
 The most skilled can take the coins   
 from the bottom, with their lips.     
{APPLES}are tied from the ceiling on a 
 long string, and each child tries to  
 bite the apple without using hands.   
{BONEFIRES,}as they are correctly      
 pronounced, are sometimes burnt.{APPLE
{TARTS}containing small coins or       
 favours are baked and eaten. This is  
 also the season for {TOFFEE APPLES.   </content>
