{Ballymoney Drama Festival} is one of  
 the oldest and most respected in      
 Ireland,lasting two weeks each year.  
 The winners in the various classes    
 qualify for the{Northern Ireland      
{Finals.} Clubs from all over the      
 province enter, not only because of   
 the high standard of performance but  
 because of the highly qualified       
 adjudicators who are invited.         
                                       
 The{Town Hall} has always been the    
 venue and the limited number of seats 
 means there is competition for        
 available tickets once the season     
 tickets have been sold. The festival  
 is a social occasion for those who    
 only meet once a year here in the     
 refreshment room during the interval  
 or after the performance.
