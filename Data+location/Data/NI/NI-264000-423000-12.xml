		<content> A comparison of the degree of         
 participation in{sporting activities  
 shows that working class play and     
 watch more sport than middle class    
 families.  The most common sports     
 watched and played by both classes are
{football, cricket, snooker, rugby,    
{swimming, darts, bowls, tennis and    
{golf. }Sports can bring people        
 together socially but can also divide 
 communities.  A local example is      
{Gaelic games}which are played almost  
 exclusively by the Roman Catholic     
 population.                           
 Middle class families tend to be more 
 involved in recreational societies and
 organisations such as{bowling clubs,  
{Boys Brigade}and{British Legion.      
 In both middle class and working class
 communities there is a great deal of  
 contentment with social life. Over 90%
 of people enjoy a happy social life.  </content>
