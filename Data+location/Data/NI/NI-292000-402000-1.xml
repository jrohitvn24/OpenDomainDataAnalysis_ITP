		<content> This is an area of low undulating     
 ground, sloping gently downward to the
 east, traversed in a west, east       
 direction by the Clady River. It is   
 predominantly cultivate pasture with  
 some arble. Bogland provides peat for 
 domestic fuel.                        
 There are two villages, Clady and     
 Inishrush, the majority of whose      
 inhabitants rent houses built in      
 recent years.                         
 Most of the inhabitants live rurally. 
 Their houses are mostly modern and    
 owner occupied.                       
 The farms are almost all owner        
 occupied, and between 30 - 60 acres in
 size.                                 
 Many of the villagers and farmers sons
 are tradesmen who travel out of the   
 area to work. Some men combine farming
 with other employment.
