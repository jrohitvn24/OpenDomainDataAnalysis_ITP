		<title>04Turf Cutting</title>
		<content>     Many people in the Trillick       
 district use turf as fuel.Turf is     
 dried peat.Around Trillick,turf is    
 found on Brougher Mountain and in some
 lowland bogs.                         
     Until a few years ago turf was dug
 out with a special two_sided          
 spade.Nowadays turf is cut with a     
 machine.                              
     This machine is pulled by a       
 powerful tractor.The machine has a    
 large wheel with a diameter of one and
 a half metres.Around the circumference
 of the wheel are small spikes.When the
 wheel is lowered into the ground it   
 revolves and the spikes dig up the    
 soft wet peat.This is put into the    
 machine where it is compressed and    
 then pushed through pipes.When it     
 comes out it looks like black tubes   
 lying on the ground.
