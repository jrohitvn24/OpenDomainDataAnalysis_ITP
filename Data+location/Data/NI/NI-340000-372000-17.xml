 Constabulary came to talk to us about 
 policing in Dundonald Area.A constable
 has to abide by 4 rules they are:-    
 (1)Preservation of Life,2,Preservation
 of Property 3,Preservation of Peace   
 4,Enforcement of Law.The uniform is   
 dark green with a peaked cap.The part 
 of the uniform that has               
 revolutionized policing is the 2-way  
 computer linked radio.There are two   
 main types of crime-crimes of violence
 and crimes of dishonesty.In 1984 in   
 Dundonald there were 279 thefts       
 including 42  car thefts.There were 32
 cases of criminal damage and 7

 can be used against a criminal.They   
 range from fines up to prison         
 sentences.A Dundonald man was finedÂ£50
 for stealing a can of oil.Another was 
 imprisoned 5 years for robbery.       </content>
