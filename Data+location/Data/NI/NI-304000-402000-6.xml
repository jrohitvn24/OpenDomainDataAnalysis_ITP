		<title>06ON THE CATTLE FARM</title>
		<content>  On Friday 14th June we went to visit 
 a cattle farm outside Ahoghill, owned 
 by Mr Austin Perry. The farm is 186   
 acres with between 50 and 55 fields.  
  156 acres are in permanent           
 intensively managed grassland which is
 cut for silage in May, July and       
 September and used as summer grazing. 
 Barley is grown on the other 30 acres.
 The silage and barley are used with   
 concentrates for winter fodder.       
  The farmer has 210 cattle, 50 of     
 these are pedigree Freisian dairy cows
 20 are pedigree Simmental a German    
 breed of beef cattle, the rest are    
 young stock.                          
  Mr Perry's dairy herd produces 1200  
 litres of milk per day which is       
 collected in tankers by the Milk      
 Marketing Board.
