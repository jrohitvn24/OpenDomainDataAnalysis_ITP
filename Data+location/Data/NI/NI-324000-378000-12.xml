		<title>12LIVING IN BALLYUTOAG</title>
		<content>  Jacqueline Windrum lives on a farm in
 Ballyutoag. She is 14 years old. With 
 her parents both involved in running  
 the farm, she has to help around the  
 house but she still has plenty of time
 for recreation. She watches           
 television for 2-3 hours per day on   
 average. Her favourite programmes are 
 Coronation Street and Dallas. She also
 enjoys quiz programmes such as        
 Connections, Blockbusters and Busman's
 Holiday.                              
  Jacqueline is a member of a number of
 organisations. One is Lylehill Young  
 Farmers Club which meets once a       
 fortnight from September to April. Its
 varied programme includes             
 demonstrations such as pottery,       
 hairdressing, keep-fit and            
 glassblowing.
