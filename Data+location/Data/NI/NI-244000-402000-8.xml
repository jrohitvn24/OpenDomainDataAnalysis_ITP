		<content> November 2nd, 1650.All on board       
 perished within 10 miles of Dover.    
 Sir John spent most of the rest of his
 life  in London and never completed   
 the work on the    castle which was to
 be his home.                          
 Sir John's tenure was given to Sir    
 William Hamilton, a friend of the Earl
 of Abercon, who later divided the     
 estate between his two sons in        
 1662,giving Gortin and Beltrim to     
 Claude, his youngest son,and Earls    
 Gift to James his elder son.          
 Thirty men of British descent were    
 taken on as tenants on the estate.    
 The Hamiltons never finished Earls    
 Gift and stands today,but for the     
 passing of time,as it did three       
 centuries ago.
