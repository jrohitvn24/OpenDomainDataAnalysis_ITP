		<content> Kernohan's Joinery Works of 22        
 Woodburn Road was formed in 1959 with 
 a labour force of four. As the range  
 of joinery products increased they    
 extended their premises to deal with a
 fibre-glass division to manufacture   
 and sell boats and equipment. In 1973 
 they withdrew from the fibre-glass    
 products to go into the production of 
 P.V.C.window frames. They were the    
 first in Northern Ireland to make any 
 type of P.V.C.window and hold the     
 franchise for "Trocal".  In l985 their
 work force  is 72, with 70% of their  
 work involved with "Trocal" window    
 frames and 30% involved with woodwork,
 which involves frames, doors, seating 
 arrangements and general joinery work.
 Weston Engineering of Woodburn Road,  
 moved to their Carrickfergus site in  
 1982. Their present work force of 50  
 manufacture agricultural equipment.   </content>
