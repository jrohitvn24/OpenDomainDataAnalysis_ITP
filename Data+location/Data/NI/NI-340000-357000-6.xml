		<title>06SAINTFIELD  SHOW (2)</title>
		<content> Many schools now compete with art,    
 woodwork,needlework,models and flower 
 pressing.Our school has won the       
 special Cup for several years in      
 succession.Stalls are organised by    
 charities and business men,and the    
 hire of these stalls helps to raise   
 some money for the Show expenses.The  
 success of the Show depends heavily on
 the weather.If it is poor weather     
 there is a substantial loss.The date  
 of the Show never alters;it is always 
 held on the third Saturday in June to 
 prevent interference with other shows.
  For many years the grounds of the    
 Price family have been used which     
 enabled expansion.
