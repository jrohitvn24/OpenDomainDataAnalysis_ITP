		<content>{The Past:-                            
 The house originally belonged to the  
{Cassidy's}who were the local gentry.  
 This family donated the house and its 
 grounds to an order of missioners     
 called the{Passionist Congregation.   
 They took possession of the house in  
{1908.}They then built the monastry and
 the church.                           
{ The Present:-                        
     The house is now used for a       
 training ground for young people.A    
 person who is just starting into the  
 ministry is called a{Novitiate.}In    
{1975}this system was changed so that  
 each Novitiate serves one year there: 
 this is called a {Postulant Year.}    
     At present there are twelve       
 priests,two postulants,one brother and
 two cooks all in residence.
