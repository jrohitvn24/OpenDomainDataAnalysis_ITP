		<content> Next season(1985-1986) Linfield       
 Football Club celebrates its          
 centenary. The first Linfield football
 team were workers at Linfield Linen   
 Mill in Belfast's famous Sandy Row. It
 is now the most powerful football team
 in the Irish League having won all the
 major trophies many, many times. It   
 has also played in many of the        
 European competitions. Their home     
 ground, just off the main Lisburn Road
 in South Belfast, is Windsor Park, a  
 place well known to every football fan
 in Northern Ireland. As it is the     
 largest football stadium in Northern  
 Ireland, it is also used by the Irish 
 Football Association for all the Home 
 International matches. One of the     
 highlights of the year for all        
 football fans is Linfield's open day  
 when they can meet the players and see
 the trophies.                         </content>
