		<content> THE RIVER FAUGHAN FLOWS THROUGH       
 DRUMAHOE. ALONG THIS RIVER AND ON THE 
 BANKS OF THE STREAMS OR BURNS THAT    
 FLOW INTO IT THERE IS EVIDENCE OF     
 FORMER INDUSTRIES WHICH USED AND      
 NEEDED WATER POWER.THERE WAS ONCE A   
 FLOURISHING{LINEN}INDUSTRY WITH  FLAX 
 MILL,BEETLING MILL AND BLEACH         
 WORKS.LOCAL FARMERS USED TO TAKE THEIR
 CORN TO THE MANY CORN MILLS AND LOCAL 
 PEOPLE GOT WOOD AND OTHER IMPLEMENTS  
 FROM THE SAW MILLS AND SPADE          
 MILLS.WHERE THE RIVERS AND BURNS DID  
 NOT FLOW FAST ENOUGH MILL RACES WERE  
 MADE AND MILL PONDS ENSURED A CONSTANT
 SUPPLY OF WATER.TODAY DRUMAHOE DOES   
 NOT HAVE AS MANY FIRMS BUT THERE ARE  
 STILL SMALL BUISNESSES AND A MODERN   
 SHIRT FACTORY  USING COMPUTERS.MOST   
 PEOPLE WHO WORK COMMUTE  TO OTHER     
 TOWNS.                                
                                       </content>
