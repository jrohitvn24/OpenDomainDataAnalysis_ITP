		<title>02 The town I live in.</title>
		<content> Bushmills is a quaint sleepy town but 
there is always so much to do.  I      
sometimes go to the Saturday night     
discos.  The town itself is a friendly 
community.  There are lots of places to
explore.  My mother would have a fit if
she knew the dangerous places I have   
explored with my friends.  For         
instance, take the old water wheel     
mill.  The boards are rotten, the place
is damp but we explored it.            
                                       
 The town is always dead on a Sunday.  
I really like living in Bushmills      
because there is always something on   
like youthclub and going out for walks 
[and raiding the orchards!].  Bushmills
is not worth mentioning if you don't   
mention the Whiskey Distillery or the  
Giants Causeway.  Despite high         
unemployment I would not change it for 
the world.                             </content>
