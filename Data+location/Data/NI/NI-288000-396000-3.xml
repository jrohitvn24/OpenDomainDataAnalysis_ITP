		<content>{Cooking:}Electricity and bottled gas  
 were the only ones used :             
 electricity = 57%, bottled gas = 43%. 
   The derelict windmill opposite our  
 school prompted us to ask whether     
 energy was used from{other sources,  }
 other than other petroleum products,  
 those listed on page 2 and our own    
 muscles.  We suggested: wind, water,  
 steam, solar energy or a beast of     
 burden. With the exception of solar   
 powered calculators we found that{none
 of these are now used in our area. We 
 did find that, on the Moyola River    
 though not in our block, there was one
{water turbine}powered electric        
 generator of 60Kw for heating a house.
   Finally with almost every house     
 having a lawn we asked,"What powers   
 the{lawnmower?"} We found :           
 petrol = 62%, electricity = 21%,      
 push = 17%.                           </content>
