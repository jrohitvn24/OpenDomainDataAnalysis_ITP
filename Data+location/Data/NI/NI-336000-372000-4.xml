		<title>04The Orangefield Area</title>
		<content> Although there are many factories in  
 the Orangefield area you would not get
 the impression that we live in an     
 industrial part of the city. The      
 factories are tastefully hidden by    
 trees and other buildings.There are   
 also many areas of parkland which make
 the area look pleasant.There are few  
 shops in the area. Most families      
 travel to other parts of the city for 
 their weekly shopping. Most shops are 
 small, catering for the immediate     
 needs of the family. The average size 
 of a family in our area is 4.2 (we    
 carried out a survey). In our area you
 can always see the green fields on the
 Castlereagh hills. There always seems 
 to be a lot of children in our area.  
 Perhaps this is because there are so  
 many schools very close together.These
 schools are Grosvenor High School (a  
  grammar school for boys and girls)   </content>
