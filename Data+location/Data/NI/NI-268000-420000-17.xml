		<title>17THE ADVENTURERS</title>
		<content> We meet at Edenmore Orange Hall on a  
 Friday night from 7.00pm - 8.00pm and 
 are divided into groups.  There is    
 about 50 of us including those from   
 Carrick.  Our uniform is green, except
 for the leaders whose uniform is      
 maroon and grey.  Mr. Hemphill and his
 wife are the captains.  When we go in 
 we have an opening prayer.  Then we do
 drill which includes marching around  
 the hall to practice for Parade Day   
 when we march from Balteagh School to 
 the church.  We also do badge work.   
 Some of these are for bible study,    
 music, church attendance and          
 Adventurer attendance.  Finally we    
 play games.  Every two years just     
 before Christmas we are presented     
 with our badges by the bishop and his 
 wife.
