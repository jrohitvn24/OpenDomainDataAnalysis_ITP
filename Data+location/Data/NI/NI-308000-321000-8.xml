 The Dual Carriageway which links Newry
 and Warrenpoint is bordered on one    
 side by the mud flats on the Clanrye  
 River and partially on the other side 
 by private houses.  It is a 4 lane    
 carriageway with a black tarmacadam   
 surface which is separated by a grass 
 verge with 2 lanes on either side.    
 The right_hand lane, in the direction 
 of travel, is used for overtaking.    
 There is a speed limit imposed of 70  
 mph.  There are 3 distinct groups of  
 people who avail of the dual          
 carriageway _ These are daily         
 commuters travelling to and from      
 Newry; heavy duty lorries transporting
 coal and paper products and other     
 containerised goods from Warrenpoint; 
 sightseers who make use of this       
 communications link particularly at   
 weekends and during the summer months.</content>
