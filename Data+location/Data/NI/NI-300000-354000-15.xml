		<title>15SAINT GOBHAN'S CHURCH</title>
		<content> The name {Seagoe}is derived from      
 the                                   
 Irish {Teg-da-goba }meaning{House of  
{Gobha.}Gobha lived in the seventh     
 century and had his cell on the mound 
 where the ruins of the old church of  
 Seagoe are still standing.            
     The parish has records going back 
 to{1674}.Not more than six other      
 parishes in Northern Ireland have     
 records going back this far.          
    By{1816}the greatly increased      
 population demanded a new church      
 should be built.Unfortunately,as the  
 graves had been allowed to encroach on
 the walls of the church,a new site was
 chosen on the other side of the road. 
      The new building,the present     
 church,is well attended by the large  
 number of new families now living in  
 the area.
