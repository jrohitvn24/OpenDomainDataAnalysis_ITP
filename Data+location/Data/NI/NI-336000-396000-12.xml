		<content>{Dunisland Fort Motte.}                
 Diameter: 42 \ metres, Circumference: 
 68 m. It is mound of earth which      
 hundreds of years ago would have had a
 wooden castle built on top. Today     
 there are many animal holes, rabbits ,
 badgers and fox. The top of the motte 
 is very bumpy and many young trees    
 have seeded. Trees are planted in     
 circles around the motte, one circle  
 at the bottom, one half way up and one
 around the top.                       
{Gabbins Fort  }                       
 Diameter: 14m Circ: 40m. This motte is
 very flat on the top. It has trees at 
 its base on one side only. It allows  
 one to see for many miles in every    
 direction. We collected many wild     
 flowers there.
