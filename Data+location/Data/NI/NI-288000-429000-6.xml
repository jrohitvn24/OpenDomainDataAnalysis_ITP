		<title>06VISIT TO U. S. P. C. A.</title>
		<content>  I went on a visit to our local U. S. 
 P. C. A. shelter. The inspector told  
 me about an owl caught in a field in  
 a wire trap. The inspector came and   
 dazzled it with a torch. He found that
 the owl had a claw broken off. After  
 treatment at the shelter the owl was  
 later returned to the wild.           
  The first bird the inspector treated 
 at this shelter was a young peregrine 
 falcon.                               
  I was allowed to see the dogs at     
 present being kept at the shelter.    
 There were about ten dogs. Some of    
 them had been abandoned by their      
 owners. The inspector pointed out that
 many people like puppies but abandon  
 them when they grow up.               
  I enjoyed my visit but I did not like
 to see the dogs people neglected.
