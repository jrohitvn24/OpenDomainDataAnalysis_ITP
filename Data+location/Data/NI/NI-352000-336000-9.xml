		<content> IN 1890 PERMISSION WAS GIVEN TO THE   
 BELFAST AND COUNTY DOWN RAILWAY TO    
 CONSTRUCT A RAILWAY LINE FROM         
 DOWNPATRICK TO ARDGLASS.THIS CAUSED   
 ARDGLASS TO BECOME VERY POPULAR WITH  
 TOURISTS AND HOLIDAY-MAKERS.MANY      
 PEOPLE TRAVELLED FROM BELFAST TO      
 ARDGLASS AND FROM DOWNPATRICK TO      
 ARDGLASS ON THE TRAIN.IN 1925 A HALT  
 WAS OPENED AT BRIGHT AND A LINE BUILT 
 FROM ARDGLASS TO BRIGHT.SOME TIME     
 DURING 1934 A HALT WAS OPENED AT CONEY
 ISLAND.TRAINS WERE AN EASY WAY OF     
 GETTING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER.IT  
 ONLY TOOK 10 MINUTES TO GET FROM      
 ARDGLASS TO DOWNPATRICK ON THE        
 TRAIN.IT TOOK MUCH LONGER IF YOU WENT 
 BY THE ROAD WHICH WAS REALLY A MUDDY  
 TRACK.ALSO PEOPLE HAD NO CARS,THEY    
 JUST USED A HORSE AND CART.SADLY IN   
 1950 THE ARDGLASS RAILWAY WAS CLOSED.
