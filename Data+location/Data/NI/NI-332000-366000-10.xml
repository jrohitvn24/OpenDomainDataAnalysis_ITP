		<content> ....cereal crop, but wheat is being   
 grown more and more in the area. A    
 third of acerage in the area is being 
 grown for cereals. Barley is more     
 common because it ripens quicker and  
 the straw is used by farmers in the   
 area for bedding. Wheat is not so     
 popular as it does not ripen until    
 late august to the early weeks of     
 september. The straw is very rough and
 course and is used for bedding for    
 horses.                               
 Crop silage  is being grown in small  
 amounts but there are proposals for   
 this to be grown over more acerage.   
 This is a mixture of grass, barley,   
 peas, beans. This is fed to the cattle
 as a substitute of silage. The farmers
 around this area rely on extensive    
 mechanization. And there is not one   
 farmer around this area that is not   
 fully mechanized.                     </content>
