		<title>16School at Carrowdore</title>
		<content> 60 years ago the Schol in Carrowdore  
 had two classrooms heated by coal     
 fires.  The school was very strict and
 the cane was used often.  The pupils  
 were taught a number of subjects -    
 Mathematics including Algebra,        
 English, and Poetry which had to be   
 learnt off by heart.  The girls did   
 cockery and laundering.  The boys     
 played football and did Nature Study. 
 If the boys met the teachers in the   
 street after school they had to salute
 to them by raising their caps.        
 The houses in Carrowdore in those days
 were mainly samll rows of cottages and
 also some whitewashed houses.  There  
 was no electricity or gas only oil    
 lamps and there were no street lights.
 Carrowdore was a very grassy place and
 the children had lots of open space to
 play on but nowadays more houses have 
 been built on the grassy spaces.      </content>
