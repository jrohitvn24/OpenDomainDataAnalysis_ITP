		<content>    The most common type of farming in 
 the area is{beef production,}followed 
 closely by dairy farming. In the      
 winter the{beef cattle}stay indoors in
 the silo, eating silage and meal. When
 they are fat enough they are sent to  
 the factory at Moy for slaughter; or  
 they are sold in the beef market in a 
 local town. It takes a calf about two 
 and a half years to become a beef     
 bullock.{Farmers}are busy people;     
 there is ploughing and making hay and 
 silage. They need machinery to assist 
 them on the farm. Most farmers here   
 have at least one tractor,a silage    
 mower, baler and perhaps other items  
 also.                                 
   {Sheep farming}is increasing in     
 popularity.Sheep need intensive care  
 at lambing season,if lambs are not to 
 be lost.In summer they have their wool
 sheared.                              </content>
