		<title>02NEW ESTATES IN CRUMLIN</title>
		<content> Crumlin is expanding very rapidly.The 
 new housing estates in Crumlin have   
 increased the populaion dramatically. 
           {TROMERY PARK               
 Campbell Cordiner Construction Ltd.   
 are the people carrying out the work  
 on Tromery Park.It is going to have 88
 houses.The development comprises of   
 semi-detached houses and semi-detached
 bungalows.There are some larger ones  
 with roofspace comversions.All houses 
 have got central heating and the      
 roofspaces are insulated.             
           {LAKE VEIW                  
 Lake Veiw is a housing estate behind  
 Orchard Hill.There are thirteen houses
 and six old age pensioners bungalows. 
 It was finished about Christmas 1984. 
 I think Lake Veiw has spoiled the     
 wildlife in the field.                
 There are two new housing estates on  
 the Cidercourt Rd. and the Glenavy Rd.</content>
