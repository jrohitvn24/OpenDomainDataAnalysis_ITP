		<content> Contained in the D.Block is the       
 historic city of{Armagh}and the       
 ancient pre-christian site of{Navan   
{Fort.}The remainder of the area is    
 made up mainly of farmland which is   
 mostly given over to grazing and the  
 production of silage for winter       
 feeding. Only a small percentage of   
 the land is taken up with cereal      
 production. Armagh being famous for   
 its{Bramley apples,}there are some    
 small orchards within the D.Block but 
 the main apple growing region lies to 
 the North of the Block.               
   The city of Armagh itself was the   
 site chosen by{St.Patrick}to build his
 first Christian church in Ireland and 
 during the 1500 years since then it   
 has remained the Ecclesiastical       
 capital.For several centuries prior to
 this the Navan Fort had been the chief
 centre for Pagan worship.             </content>
