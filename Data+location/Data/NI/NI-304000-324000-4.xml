		<content> Ballymacdermot mountain,the other is a
 cairn at the top of Camlough          
 mountain.The one at the top of        
 Camlough mountain is a typical        
 mountain Cairn, that is, stones heaped
 up in a pile.The Cairn at             
 Ballymacdermot is different,it is     
 known as a court Cairn.The stones at  
 the front of this Cairn are in the    
 shape of a circle with an             
 entrance.This circle is known as the  
 Court and the chamber is at the back  
 of the Court.The remains of Stoneage  
 man were usually cremated and his     
 ashes put into an urn.                
 Sometimes his bones and ashes were    
 placed on a basin and all then placed 
 in the chamber.                       
             Our school works with the 
 Department of the Environment and we  
 help to keep this Court Cairn in      
 order.                                </content>
