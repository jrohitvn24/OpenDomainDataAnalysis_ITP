		<title>17UPPER KNOCKBREDA ROAD</title>
		<content>     When our school was opened in 1958
 there was a{narrow, hilly, winding    
{road,}known as the{Hillfoot Road,     
{running}alongside. In 1962 a new{dual 
{carriageway}was constructed with two  
 lanes going in each direction. To make
 it safer for pedestrians an overhead  
 footbridge was erected near the       
 school. Our class, P7G, carried out a 
 traffic survey, and as we expected the
{greatest volume}of traffic was during 
 the{morning}and{evening rush Hour.    
 In the morning the number of vehicles 
 averaged{1342 per hour}eastwards and  
{1548}westwards. In the evening the    
 figures were{1360}and{1564.}For the   
 rest of the morning and afternoon     
 surveyed the average rates were{778   
 and{810}per hour. Thus traffic pattern
 has changed much over 20 years.
