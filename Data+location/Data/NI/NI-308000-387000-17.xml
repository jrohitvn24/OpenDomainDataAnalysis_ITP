		<title>17SHANES CASTLE</title>
		<content> The O'Neill family and Shanes Castle  
 have played an important part in the  
 history of the province of Ulster.    
   There was a ruined castle here in   
 1596,then known as 'Edendow Carreck'. 
 In 1607,during the Plantation of      
 Ulster King James 1 settled the estate
 upon Shane McBrian O'Neill.The name   
 Shanes Castle is probably derived from
 this man.                             
    The castle increased in size until 
 by the 18th century it had become a   
 fine castellated structure.           
     The village of Edenduffcarrick    
 which stood beside the castle was     
 removed to another site by            
 John,Viscount O'Neill around 1780 as  
 it spoilt his view.                   
     In 1816 the castle was destroyed  
 by fire.The terrace and Conservatory  
 designed by John Nash escaped the     
 fire.                                 </content>
