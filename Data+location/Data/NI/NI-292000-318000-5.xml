		<title>05Confirmation in Cullyhanna.</title>
		<content> Confirmation takes place in our parish
 church every year.Through Confirmation
 we become full members of the church  
 and acquire responsibility in the     
 church.Confirmation is the Sacrament  
 which makes us strong and perfect     
 christians and co-workers of Jesus    
 Christ.This year there were 49        
 children to be confirmed.31 from      
 Cullyhanna,6from Carrickrovaddy and 12
 from Newtownhamilton.The chapel is    
 decorated with flowers and the choir  
 who practise in advance for this big  
 occasion sing many hymns to the Holy  
 Spirit.The children to be confirmed   
 dress very specially on this day.After
 the Mass, the Bishop comes to meet the
 children and their parents informally 
 outside the chapel where they can chat
 freely and have a photograph taken.The
 whole family goes out to lunch and the
 parish priest entertains the Bishop.  </content>
