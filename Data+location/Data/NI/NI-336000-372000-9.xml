		<title>09The Connswater River</title>
		<content> The Connswater got its name from a man
 called Con Brian McFertagh O'Neill. He
 lived three hundred years ago and was 
 a famous man in those days. The river 
 rises in the Castlereagh hills to the 
 south of Belfast and runs northwards  
 through east Belfast until it reaches 
 the sea at Belfast Lough. As the      
 Connswater approaches the sea it gets 
 much wider. This is because in the    
 past the sea used to reach further    
 inland. There is a man called Jim     
 Patton who writes in a local newspaper
 the "East Belfast Post" (a free       
 newspaper). He said that years ago the
 river was tidal and often the river   
 came right over the banks and flooded 
 the streets on the other side. In     
 those days the river was clean and    
 pleasant and people used to have      
 pic-nics on the banks. Jim Patton can 
 also remember watching a pair (Pg.10) </content>
