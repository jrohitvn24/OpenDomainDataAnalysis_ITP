		<content> THE METAL BOX COMPANY OCCUPIES A LARGE
 SITE ON THE BROWNSTOWN  ROAD AND      
 EMPLOYS 215 FULL TIME AND 16 TEMPORARY
 WORKERS. IT PRODUCES TIN CANS FOR THE 
 PACKAGING OF PROCESSED MEATS AND      
 VEGETABLES. FIVE MILLION CANS AND TEN 
 MILLION ENDS ARE PRODUCED EACH WEEK.  
 THE FACTORY CURRENTLY USES A TOTAL OF 
 SEVENTY TWO MACHINES ARRANGED IN EIGHT
 LINES ON THE FACTORY FLOOR.           
 UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT    
 DECADE IT HAD BEEN THE PRACTICE TO    
 SOLDER THE CANS BUT DUE TO NEWLY      
 INTRODUCED E.E.C. REGULATIONS THE     
 FACTORY IS AT PRESENT CHANGING OVER   
 COMPLETELY TO WELDING CANS. THIS      
 CHANGE WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE   
 HIGH LEAD CONTENT IN THE SOLDER WHICH 
 HAS BEEN POSITIVELY EXPOSED AS A      
 HEALTH RISK TO THE CONSUMER.          
 CANS ARE MANUFACTURED IN A RANGE OF   
 SIZES FROM 5 OZS. TO 6 LBS.           </content>
