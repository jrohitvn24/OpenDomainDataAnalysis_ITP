		<content>       Our area is in{Newtownabbey.}   
 This is the third largest town in     
 Northern Ireland,although it is not   
 really like a town as it is a large   
 sprawling place. The part that we live
 in is like a suburb of{Belfast}and it 
 is mostly{residential.}               
{     }Much of our map is covered by a 
 large housing estate called{Rathcoole}
 which is one of the biggest in Europe.
 It is managed by the Northern Ireland 
 Housing Executive.                    
       As well as the large areas of   
 housing there is a large area of      
 uncultivated highland called{Carnmoney
{Hill.}                                
       There are several factories,    
 notably{S.T.C.}and{Camco.}There is a  
 good road system and buses and trains 
 serve the area. Schools,shops and     
 churches are numerous. We have a      
 hospital and a good leisure centre.   </content>
