		<title>13THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> To the left of the pulpit there is a  
 stained glass window, with a picture  
 of Jesus and a King standing by the   
 water.Opposite the pulpit there is a  
 stained glass patterned window. There 
 are many plaques in the church and one
 is in the memory of James Clow, whose 
 headstone is outside the church.The   
 Clow family were once  important in   
 this area but now there is none       
 bearing that name living there.There  
 are 2 U.D.R. memorials; one in the    
 memory of Dennis Wilson, 24           
 Platoon,who was killed in 1971 and    
 John Reid 8th battalion, who was      
 killed by terrorists in 1977. Thereis 
 a very ornate marble plaque in the    
 memory of{Rev. Daniel                 
 Manderson,who preached for 21 years.He
 was highly commended for his faithful 
 ministry.
