		<content> Grandfather and his friends made their
 games from the chestnuts on the trees 
 and the sticks in the hedge. They     
 played marbles which we still play    
 today but their 'toys' were hand-made.
{Stilts}were made from two tins        
 (usually syrup) and string attached   
 -they walked on these. They made      
{catapults}from a Y-shaped piece of    
 wood and used pieces of rubber from   
 old bicycle tyres for the stretchy    
 part. I can still make a catapult.    
  The older folk {ceilied}in each      
 other's houses at night, telling yarns
 and ghost stories. There were no T.V.s
 or videos to spoil their conversations
 and when the candles burned low or the
{paraffin}was done in the{tilly-lamps} 
 they sat in the glow of the fire. My  
 grandfather says times were hard but  
 there was less violence, vandalism or 
 dissatisfaction  which exists today.  </content>
