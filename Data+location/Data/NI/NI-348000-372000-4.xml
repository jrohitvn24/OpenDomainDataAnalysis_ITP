		<title>04ENTERTAINMENT IN NEWTOWNARDS</title>
		<content> Entertainment started in the Inns and 
 Public Houses and it is there to-day  
 that people can enjoy live            
 entertainment. Newtownards has no     
 theatre or cinema. The Council own the
 Queens Hall which is used for         
 entertainment sponsored by the Arts   
 Committee. These programmes cover     
 ballet, orchestral concerts, opera,   
 plays and classical music groups. The 
 Ards Choral Society and local bands   
 often perform in the Queen'S Hall.    
 Open air concerts are arranged in the 
 summer months. A Festival week is held
 in June when there is a very varied   
 programme of events to suit all       
 tastes. The Town Hall is devoted to   
 the Arts - exhibitions of interest,   
 paintings and photographs. Exhibition 
 matches are arranged for different    
 sports and local celebrities are      
 encouraged to participate.            </content>
