		<title>07 MOBILE SHOP.</title>
		<content>  A mobile shop visits our area near   
 DAMHEAD SCHOOL every Tuesday          
 morning.The run the driver follows was
 started in 1916 using a horse and     
 cart. It now takes in the Limavady,   
 Castlerock, Coleraine and Ballymoney  
 areas.                                
  The owner has a permanent shop which 
 he uses as his base. He is on the road
 6 days a week. He sells general       
 groceries, some feeding stuffs and    
 heating oils. He calls at the doors of
 houses in the countryside or drives   
 right into the farmyard.              
  The best years for mobile shops were 
 the 1960's. Now there are only 4 or 5 
 left in Co. Londonderry.              
  This man is stopping his run at the  
 end of June 1985 as it is not paying. 
 People now have their own cars and he 
 can't compete with prices in the large
 supermarkets.                         </content>
