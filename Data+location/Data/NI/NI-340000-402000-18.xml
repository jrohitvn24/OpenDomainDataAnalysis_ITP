		<title>18Amateur Theatre Costs</title>
		<content> Cost and committment in the amateur   
 theatre are high. Teams travelling to 
 a Drama Festival like that in Larne   
 will have their expenses paid. This   
 includes royalties, set transport     
 costs, and travel for cast and stage  
 team.                                 
 The current admission price is Â£1.50, 
 but it is impossible to meet all the  
 expenses of running a Festival from   
 box office receipts alone. Fund       
 raising events such as jumble sales,  
 coffee evenings, garden parties and   
 cake sales are organised by the local 
 committee, and sponsorship from local 
 firms and individuals is sought. The  
 local Arts Advisory Committee makes an
 annual grant (this year Â£300).
