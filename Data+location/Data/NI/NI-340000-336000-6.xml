		<content> This village is principally a         
 dormitory town for those working in   
 Newcastle, Downpatrick and even       
 Belfast. It is also the service centre
 for many of the farms around. The     
 shops and the pharmacy sell baler     
 twine, barbed wire and poultry food,  
 worm drench and cures for hooze as    
 well as fish fingers, bread and       
 aspirins! In the many pubs, the talk  
 is as likely to be of lambing and     
 feed prices as of football scores. The
 pubs also have a thriving pub quiz    
 league. A hot food take-away has      
 recently opened in the village and    
 unfortunately contributes greatly to  
 the litter. The old potato and coal   
 warehouses have been taken over by a  
 furniture shop and a very busy        
 upholstery business. A knitwear and   
 woolshop thrives in one of the streets
 behind the main road.                 </content>
