		<content>   If you live in South or West Belfast
 and want to swim, play indoor or      
 outdoor games, join a craft class,or  
 take your child to a playgroup then   
 the place to go is the Olympia Leisure
 Centre. It is in the Boucher Road,    
 built on part of the Bog Meadows and  
 was opened in 1983. About 4000 people 
 use it every week. Indoors there is a 
 main hall for sport, concerts etc., a 
 large swimming pool, a social area and
 snack bar, a craft room, an exercise  
 room as well as the playcentre for    
 young children. Outdoors there is a   
 floodlit all-weather sports pitch and 
 a running track. Many local schools   
 and youth organisations use the centre
 and many school children spend much of
 their summer holiday taking part in   
 the special summer scheme activities.
