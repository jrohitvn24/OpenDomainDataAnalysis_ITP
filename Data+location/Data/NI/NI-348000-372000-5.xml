		<title>05NEWTOWNARDS FESTIVAL EVENTS</title>
		<content> Every year in June the town of        
 Newtownards holds festival week during
 which a great variety of events take  
 place. These are usually organised by 
 local clubs, societies and            
 organisations and are sponsored by the
 local council who provide             
 accommodation and prizes for each of  
 the events. Sports of different kinds 
 take place. There are tennis and      
 soccer competitions, go-kart racing   
 round the streets of the town, a ten  
 kilometres road race, a half marathon 
 and cycle races. Other events include 
 exhibitions and displays. The         
 Historical Society organise an        
 exhibition of historical interest,    
 there is a vintage car display,       
 photographic exhibitions and an air   
 show at the local airport. All these  
 events are well supported by the local
 population and people from elsewhere. </content>
