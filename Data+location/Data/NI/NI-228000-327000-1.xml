 This a a rural area with a small      
 linear village The landscape consists 
 of small Drumlin Hills with areas of  
 flat land especially around the shore 
 of UpperLhough Erne.                  
 The main occupation is farming based  
 on beef and dairy cattle. Arable      
 farming is now existent but sheep are 
 becoming increasingly popular on the  
 recently drained and reseeded areas.  
 Much improvement has taken place on   
 the land in recent years in terms of  
 buildings,concrete lanes, drainage,   
 hedge removal and reseeding.          
 Settlement is concentrated in three   
 small estates in the village and      
 around                                
 the village itself while the farming  
 population is dispersed throughout the
 area alongwith numerous non famring   
 people.                               </content>
