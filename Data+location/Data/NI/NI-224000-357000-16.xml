		<content> The animals were always brought inside
 the banks at nights because neighbours
 might steal them.                     
       At one of the Raths or "forts"  
 as the locals call them there was also
 a moat on the outside of the bank.This
 would have been an extra security     
 measure.                              
       These Raths are sometimes called
 "Fairy Forts" and there are a lot of  
 superstitions about them. Some old    
 people claim they would not cut trees 
 or damage the area in any way in case 
 it would bring them bad luck.
