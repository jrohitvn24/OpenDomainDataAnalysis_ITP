		<title>14LOCAL MEDIA IN NEWTOWNARDS</title>
		<content> Newtownards has two main examples of  
 media. There is a newspaper and a     
 local radio station. The newspaper is 
 called the Chronicle and is ll2 years 
 old. The founder of the Chronicle was 
 William Hery, but now Ian Alexander is
 the owner. The circulation of the     
 Chronicle is l3,000 and it generally  
 consists of 28-32 pages each week.    
 Thirty-two people are employed at the 
 Chronicle office, including 4         
 reporters, 3 photographers and 6      
 office staff as well as the remaining 
 printers who operate computers and    
 printing machines. The area the       
 Chronicle covers is North and Mid     
 Down, Ards Peninsula, Comber and its  
 surrounding area as well as           
 Newtownards. Our local radio station  
 called Downtown Radio is situated just
 outside Newtownards and provides news 
 and entertainment for old and young.  </content>
