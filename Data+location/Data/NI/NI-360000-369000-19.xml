		<content>    There is only one football pitch in
 Ballywalter. It is used by boys,      
 girls,ladies and men. The dressing    
 room is in two sections, one for the  
 visiting team and one for the home    
 team.                                 
    There are three football teams for 
 men and three for boys. Every year the
 ladies play a charity match.          
    There used to be a lawn tennis club
 but it closed. Now there are          
 hardcourts which are used by the      
 summer visitors.                      
    Many of the men have small boats   
 and during the summer they have       
 angling competitions.                 
    There are yoga and keep-fit classes
 for ladies.                           
    Some of the men go out early and   
 late to shoot ducks and pigeons and a 
 few go jogging.
