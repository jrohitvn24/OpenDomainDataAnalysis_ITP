 The area, being rural is fairly       
 sparcely populated except for a centre
 of population in the village of       
 Annalong where there about 1600       
 people.                               
 51% of the population are males.      
 However it is interesting that in the 
 over 60 age group there is a          
 predominance of females. In the 40-50 
 years old age group there is a        
 predominance of males but in the other
 age groups the ratio is about 50-50.  
 The vast majority of people are       
 working class. In a survey we did we  
 found that only about 10% were        
 professional people.This is probably  
 why there are so many council houses. </content>
