		<title>05FARMING _ HEDGES &amp; WILDLIFE</title>
		<content>      Hedges are used to separate      
 different fields.  They are better    
 than the usual wooden fences because  
 they also help wildlife.              
                                       
     The{Hawthorne}bush or white thorn 
 is good because it has spikes and it  
 grows thick which gives shelter to    
 wildlife.  Birds will also nest in it 
 e.g.{blackbird}                       
                                       
      The hawthorne is usually found on
 top of a bank.  When it is overgrown  
 it will have to be cut down.  To cut  
 we use a tractor-mounted saw.         
                                       
      Some of the twigs may be burnt or
 used as slips, although to use as     
 slips the bush will have to be cut at 
 a certain time of year.  The very     
 large pieces of wood will be sold for 
 firewood.                             </content>
