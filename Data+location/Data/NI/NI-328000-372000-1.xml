		<content> Our 4 x 3 grid covers most of the area
 generally known as West Belfast. It is
 an area of contrasts - from           
 traditional inner city housing to new 
 suburban housing estates; from        
 derelict land to large areas of rough 
 mountain side pasture; from high      
 density{population}areas to           
 sparely populated mountain side;      
 from army forts to{rural}tranquility. 
 Ours is the area most associated with 
 the popular image of{violence}        
 and civil unrest that most outsiders  
 have of Belfast.It is, therefore, an  
 area with all the attendant problems  
 of a typical industrial city but with 
 its own unique problems. Life here    
 exists against a unique background -  
 but amazingly people have adapted to a
 lifestyle constantly corrupted by     
{para-military}and{military}activity.
