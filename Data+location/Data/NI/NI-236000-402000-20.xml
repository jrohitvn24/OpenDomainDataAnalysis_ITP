		<title>20OUR DOMESDAY PROJECT 1985</title>
		<content>{1}THE P7's OF CLOUGHCOR SCHOOL        
   ARE TRYING TO MAKE A BRAND NEW BOOK 
   THE DOMESDAY PROJECT IT IS CALLED   
   SO AROUND THE AREA WE TOOK A LOOK.  
{2}ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS A BIT UNUSUAL     
   TO SEE CHILDREN OUT OF CLASS        
   WE ENJOY SEEING WHAT'S HISTORICAL   
   AND LOVE TO WALK AROUND THE GRASS   
{3}IF THE SUN IS SHINING               
   IT'S GREAT CRACK TO GO OUT          
   BUT IF IT'S RAINING                 
   WE HAVE TO WRITE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
{4}WE LIKE EXPLORING CHURCHYARDS       
   AND SEEING HOW THE RIVERS FLOW      
   WE WALK ALONG THE OLD CANAL         
   AND WATCH THE GRASS AND BARLEY GROW.
{5}SO WHEN WE LEAVE CLOUGHCOR          
   WE ALWAYS WILL REMEMBER             
   THE TIMES WE WENT EXPLORING         
   FOR OUR DOMESDAY ENDEAVOUR.
