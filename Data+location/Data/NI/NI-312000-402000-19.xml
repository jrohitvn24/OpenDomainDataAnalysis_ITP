		<content>{CHURCH}  The new St. Patrick's Church 
 was opened in 1961 to replace the old 
 building which had stood since 1810   
 in the centre of the graveyard.The    
 stonework of the 4 corners remain     
 today, marking the perimeter.At the   
 demolition of the old church, an      
 interesting find was that of a board  
 in the heavily timbered roof on which 
 had been pencilled the following:     
 "J. Cosbie, Builder; Take notice that 
 I, Hugh Wasson, of No.556 Ballykeel   
 Loyal Orange Lodge, sheeted the roof  
 of this chapel with the help of John  
 and James Mulvenna and John Getty."   
   Catholicism in this area can be     
 traced back many centuries. There is  
 strong evidence to suggest that the   
 Penal Laws were rigourously enforced, 
 the Catholics being dispossessed of   
 their Churches and the Mass was       
 outlawed.                             </content>
