		<title>01Observations on Portstewart</title>
		<content> Portstewart is a small but growing    
 seaside town on the north coast of    
 Northern Ireland. It was originally a 
 fishing village but with the growth of
 the tourist trade over the last       
 century it has become a small but     
 popular holiday resort.               
  Much of the housing now caters for   
 people who are either retired or who  
 work in the larger towns which        
 surround it,such as Coleraine,        
 Ballymoney,Ballymena and Limavady.    
  The area surrounding the town is     
 farming land mostly catering for the  
 raising of dairy cattle although some 
 crops are also grown.                 
   There is virtually no manufacturing 
 industry in the town.
