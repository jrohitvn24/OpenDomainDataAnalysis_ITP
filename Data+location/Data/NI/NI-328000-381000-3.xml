		<content>   The major playing fields are the    
 City of Belfast Playing Fields        
 covering a large area.  The site has a
 pavilion with full changing rooms,    
 many all weather and grass pitches for
 hockey, rugby and football. In 1985 a 
 new 9 hole golf course was opened     
 adjacent to the playing fields on the 
 Glengormley side. These playing fields
 are bookable by clubs, groups etc for 
 competitions and the busiest day is   
 Saturday, although the fields are open
 during the week.                      
   The O'Neill Park on the Ballyclare  
 Road is the most used park in the     
 area. This has several all weather    
 pitches, children's play, walking and 
 sitting areas, tennis courts and      
 bowling green and is looked after by  
 the Council. Many local competitions  
 are held here. Other fields belong to 
 Schools or Clubs, for private use only</content>
