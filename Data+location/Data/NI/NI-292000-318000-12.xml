		<title>12Farming in Cullyhanna,contd.</title>
		<content> He has a full time worker on the      
 farm and members of the family help   
 with some chores,e.g sweeping yard,   
 feeding pigs,driving cows home to be  
 milked,helping in the dairy.Water     
 and electricity are laid on and the   
 buildings and machinery are modern.   
 The silos have slatted floors with    
 cubicles and stalls for the cattle    
 and the piggery is divided into pens  
 with slatted floors also.Animals are  
 bought or sold at the local Marts in  
 Newtownhamilton and Camlough.         
 There are 2 tractors on the farm,a    
 Ford 4600 and a Universal which are   
 in use every day.Minor repairs are    
 carried out by members of the family  
 and there is a forge locally.Farming  
 involves much written work,and like   
 many farmers of the area,Sean is      
 dissatisfied with the Grants'System   
 and penalised by the E.E.C.Milk Levy. </content>
