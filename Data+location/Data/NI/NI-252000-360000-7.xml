		<title>07HOUSING A BUNGALOW</title>
		<content> The{houses}in this district are mostly
{bungalows,}one storey high.However    
 most of the farm houses in the country
 are two storey high.Nearly all houses 
 are modern and comfortable.All the    
 older houses have been renovated in   
 the last twenty five years.Our house  
 is a bungalow type.It was built about 
 50 years ago but was renovated nine   
 years ago.It consists of three        
 bedrooms,a small hall,a sitting room,a
 living room,a bathroom,a kitchen and a
 porch at the front.Like most houses   
 today the{kitchen}has a lot of modern 
 conveniences like a washing machine,a 
 fridge,a cooker and hot and cold      
 water.Nearly all the houses today have
 a bathroom and flush toilet.There are 
 special grants paid by the{government 
 to help people to renovate old houses 
 and make them modern.
