		<content> Peat is not cut in this block, but    
 several of the farmers in the South   
 West corner of the block own the right
 to cut peat on Butter Mountain and in 
 the Spaltha area.                     
 The cottage at 311313 was the first to
 produce its own electricity from      
 running water. Until it was sold this 
 year, a small turbine in a shed       
 produced power from a conduited stream
 which ran in a channel from 312300.   
 This channel was variously cut into   
 turf and lined with stones, cut into  
 bedrock, and conducted in timber built
 channelling. Recent vandalism made it 
 difficult to maintain but it sufficed 
 to produce enough power for lighting, 
 etc.
