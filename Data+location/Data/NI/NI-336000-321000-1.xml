		<content> This is a beautiful part of the       
 Mourne Mountains.   Squares 4-8-12 are
 totally sea.   Squares 3-7-11 are     
 almost totally sea with coastline     
 which is half flat rock and other half
 shingle mud or sand.   The main road  
 from Newcastle to Kilkeel runs        
 directly NS through squares 2-6-10 on 
 either side of the road there are     
 quite a number of houses and the small
 hamlet of Glassdriemman in the centre 
 with a Catholic Church and primary    
 school, squares 1,5,9  are taken up   
 with undulating low land rising gently
 to the foothill of the Mournes-highest
 point in top left hand corner is Long 
 Seefin with a river turning from it o 
 the sea.   The land is largely rough  
 arable land with fields surrounded by 
 lovely Landbuilt walls typical of the 
 area, main feature in these squares is
 part of the new water line being built</content>
