		<title>19Our Sunday in Aughnacloy</title>
		<content> Yesterday morning I didn't go to      
{Sunday School}or{Church}as I normally 
 do because our family went to{Portrush
 our nearest{holiday resort},more than 
{70 miles}away.Instead of watching T.V.
 or visiting we decided on a day out,as
 it was a lovely morning.We arrived in 
{Portrush}about noon and had a meal    
 which was stew.If we had been at home 
 we would have had{potatoes,meat}and{2 
{vegetables}followed by{ice-cream      
 with{jelly}and{fruit}.After eating our
 stew we went to the{amusement arcade  
 where we stayed for a while.About 3   
 p.m. we went to{Portstewart beach,    
 about{4 miles}away,and swam in the    
 sea.When we changed out of our        
 swimming clothes we went back to      
{Portrush}for a last look through the  
 shops before heading home to          
{Aughnacloy.
