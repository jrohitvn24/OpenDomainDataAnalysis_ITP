		<content>{Kennedy Mc Arthur}was born in{DERVOCK 
 in 1881, where he went to school. When
 he left, he worked as a postman and   
 often ran on his delivery round. At   
 the age of 24 he emigrated to{SOUTH   
{AFRICA,}where he joined the police    
 force and his interest in athletics   
 was encouraged. He won his first      
 marathon race in 1908 and was chosen  
 for the{SOUTH AFRICAN}team to go to   
 the{STOCKHOLM OLYMPIC GAMES}in 1912.  
 On a very hot July 14th, 68 runners   
 started the{25 MILE}race but it       
 turned out to be a cruel event_only 35
 finished. McARTHUR won the{GOLD }     
{MEDAL}in{2hr,36min,54.8 sec.}He came  
 home to{DERVOCK,}and after a great    
 reception returned to{SOUTH AFRICA}   
 and settled in{POTCHEFSTROOM,}where   
 the local museum has a special display
 of his trophies. He died in 1960 and  
 is buried in Potchefstroom Cemetery.  </content>
