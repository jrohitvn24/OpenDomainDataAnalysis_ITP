		<content>{MARKETING}is conducted as follows:_   
 1.Large quantities are sold fresh to  
 shops and supermarkets all over the   
 Province and in the Republic of       
 Ireland                               
 2.The less attractive apples are sent 
 to factories for canning or for juice 
 extraction,both of which facilities   
 exist locally (but not within our     
 area)                                 
 3.Many are sent for preserving by a   
 new method recently developed in      
 County Armagh. This technique gives a 
 pure (no preservatives added) Bramley 
 product sterilised to give an 18-month
 shelf-life,yet retaining all the      
 characteristics of the apple. The     
 product is packed in aluminium foil   
 "pouches" and is very successful.     
 4.A large proportion of the top       
 quality apples is stored. This is done
 in numerous{GAS STORES}               </content>
