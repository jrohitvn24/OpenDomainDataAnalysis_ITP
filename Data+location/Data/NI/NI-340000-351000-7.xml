		<content> When sheep are lambing it is possible 
 to be up all night getting a single   
 one lambed.When sheep are due they    
 need looked at about three times each 
 night.Then in the morning if the      
 lamb is weak and the ewe has no milk  
 the lamb will need some powdered milk 
 with boiling water and this makes lamb
 milk.Sometimes you will need colostrum
 to give the lamb strength.If the ewe  
 continues not to have milk it will    
 have to be bottle fed.This is called  
 a pet lamb.If a lamb is born in a     
 field when it is raining it may need  
 warmed and dried.When the sheep are   
 in the lambing season they are let out
 of the house at dawn and brought in at
 dusk.
