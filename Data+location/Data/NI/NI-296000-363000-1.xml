		<title>01Southern Shore:Lough Neagh</title>
		<content> Over half of this block is occupied by
 Lough Neagh the largest fresh water   
 lake in the islands. The remaining    
 area is both low lying and flat and is
 corssed by natural and artificial     
 drainage channels.  The low gradient  
 conbined with a high water tablee has 
 given rise to te development of fen   
 peat. The resultant rough grazing     
 interrupted by rushes is used for     
 cattle grazing. The townlands like    
 many in the area generally begin with 
 the prefix 'derry' which is derived   
 from the Irish word meaning oak wood. 
 No trace of oak forest remains. There 
 are  few patches of scrub woodland in 
 which willow is predominant.          
 Settlement is sparce and the only     
 settlement of any size is the small   
 village of Charlestown or Bannfoot.
