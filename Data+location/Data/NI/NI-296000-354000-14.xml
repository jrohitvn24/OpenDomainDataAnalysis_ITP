		<title>14INDUSTRIES</title>
		<content>   There are few industries in this    
 rural area,but two very successful    
 examples are related to{building,}and 
 since this is extensive here and in   
 the large towns nearby,there is a     
 ready market for the products.        
   First there is a{brick-making}firm  
 established some 30 years ago.Two     
 types of brick are made here. The     
 first,the{concrete block}(various     
 sizes) is used in building private    
 houses,and outbuildings on farms-apple
 stores,cattle sheds etc. The second   
 type is a more recent product,made by 
 only a few firms in the Province. It  
 is the{"ash" or "clinker" brick}-very 
 light in weight,and made from ash or  
 clinker obtained from power           
 stations.Because of the air-pockets   
 contained within the brick,it has     
 insulating qualities and so is popular
 for building.This is marketed widely. </content>
