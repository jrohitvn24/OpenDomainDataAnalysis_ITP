		<content>  There was once a man called Fegan who
 had a rotten wife. his wife was very  
 cruel to him. One day she died.At that
 time there werw a lot of trees down   
 the Bann Lane and at each side the    
 trees were all clumped together. As   
 the men were carrying the coffin down 
 the Lane it hit an overhanging branch.
 The coffin fell to the ground and     
 burst open.Fegan's wife sat up and    
 started shouting that she would never 
 forgive  him for trying to bury her   
 alive.He took her home, made her a cup
 of tea and was kind to her, but still 
 she would not forgive him.She lived   
 for another 20 years and it was even  
 worse  than before.At last she died,  
 to Fegan's relief, and on the way down
 the Lane Fegan was heard to shout,    
 "MIND THE TREES."
