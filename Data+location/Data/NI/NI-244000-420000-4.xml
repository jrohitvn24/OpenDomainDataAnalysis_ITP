		<title>04FOYLE BRIDGE</title>
		<content>    This new bridge,opened on May 31st 
 1984,forms the southern boundary line 
 for our area.The Foyle Bridge has been
 a great asset to the people of Derry  
 in the short time it has been opened. 
 It is the largest in Ireland,being    
 865 ms. in length and 130ft in height,
 constructed of steel and costing Â£17m.
 The 6 components,using about 5,000    
 tons of steel,were constructed in the 
 Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard. Sections of 
 the bridge were brought to Derry by   
 barge. The bridge was designed        
 specially to cope with the strong     
 winds which occur in this area. The   
 bridge is built on the outskirts of   
 the city at Madam's Bank,which is the 
 widest part of the river. It is       
 situated in a quiet residential area  
 and has added to the beauty of the    
 environment with the surrounding      
 bankings being landscaped.            </content>
