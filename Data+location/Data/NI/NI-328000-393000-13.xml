		<content>    As well as the villages in the area
 having names, all other areas  can  be
 identified by the {townland}name.These
 are mostly derived from the Irish name
 although some are corruptions  of  old
 names.An example is {Ballyeaston},from
 Bally Austin - Austins  town - as  the
 church was dedicated to St. Augustine.
    In all names{Bally}is  derived from
{Baile},a town or townland, for example
{Ballynure}-town of the yew tree- which
 are still found in the old graveyard. 
   {Ballycorr }receives  its  name from
 the word{"Coire"}- pot-shaped  hollows
 worn in the nearby river bed.         
{  }This area is mainly associated with
{Ballyclare}which is 1 mile S.W. of the
 block , and  means{ town of the plain,
 made by the Sixmile Water which  flows
 through the D-block.
