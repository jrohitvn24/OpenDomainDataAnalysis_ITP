		<title>11SUPERSTITIONS:-FAIRY TREES</title>
		<content> Within this area there is a           
 superstition concerning certain trees 
 - fairy trees.                        
    Fairy trees are trees that stand   
 out by themselves and are usually oak 
 trees. Legend has it that fairies     
 dance round the trees at night and if 
 somene cuts them down, an accident    
 will befall them.                     
  Outside Ballyshannon in Co. Donegal, 
 there was a fairy tree in a field     
 which was to be cut down to make way  
 for a factory. The man who was to cut 
 it started to cut and the chainsaw    
 slipped and cut him, and as he ran to 
 the road for help, a gate fell on top 
 of him.                               
    There are many other incidents like
 this, hence in this area there are a  
 number of fairy trees.
