		<title>11Farming;Murlough</title>
		<content> The western side of the Murlough sand 
 spit has been reclaimed as farmland.  
 It is used for pasture, potatoes, and 
 occasionally barley or oats. The      
 relationship between the farmer and   
 the managers of the Nature Reserve has
 been a close one with the farmer being
 very sympathetic to the ideals of     
 nature conservation. This has meant   
 that he has avoided such activities as
 spraying fields close to the Reserve, 
 using pesticides or herbicides where  
 these might affect Reserve wildlife,  
 letting any chemicals get into the    
 water supply,etc. The change of       
 ownership of the farm this past year  
 has caused the Reserve managers       
 concern lest the new owner might be   
 less enlightened. Immediately to the  
 West of the farmland, the Cut is a    
 strip of rough uncultivated ground    
 which is also part of the Reserve.    </content>
