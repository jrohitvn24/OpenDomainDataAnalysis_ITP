		<title>05DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content>{ Dairy farmers}get up around 8:00AM   
 to bring the cows into the parlour for
 milking. The milkers are put on the   
 cows and this brings the milk into a  
 glass jar which measures the amount   
 given by each animal.It, then goes    
 through pipes into the tank to cool.  
 When it is cool a milk tanker collects
 it, and brings it to the dairy where  
 it is bottled.It is delivered to the  
 shops or collected by milkmen.        
    Most dairy cattle in this area are 
{fresian}and sixty cows would be the   
 average size of the herd.             
    With the introduction of the milk  
 quota some farmers have had to reduce 
 the amount of milk produced on their  
 farms.
