		<title>14EDUCATION,TRANSFER EXAM</title>
		<content>    The 30th of June will be my last   
 day at{Abbots Cross Primary School}.  
 It hardly seems that I have been there
 for seven years.                      
    I started the school when I was    
 five _ I went into P1 and I remember  
 being quite scared. Now I am in P7 and
 quite hesitant about having to go to a
 new school.                           
    In P7 I had to do an exam which is 
 really called the"Transfer Procedure",
 but we call it the "Eleven Plus". This
 exam is to decide what type of school 
 we all go to next. If you get an "A"  
 you go to a Grammar School, if you get
 a "G" you go to a Secondary School. If
 you get an "M" that is a borderline   
 and you may get into a Grammar School.
     I got a "G" which most people     
 think is like failing but I don't mind
 as quite a few of my class will be    
 going with me to{Hopefield High}.     </content>
