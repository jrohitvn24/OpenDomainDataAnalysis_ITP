		<title>12  Housing, West Belfast</title>
		<content>   Here we have both pre-war and post- 
 war{terraces, council estates}built   
 just after the war, and many{private  
{estates}of detached and semi-detached 
 villas. In some areas we see the      
 demolition of blocks of{flats}which   
 proved unsatisfactory to the majority 
 of residents. New Housing Executive   
 houses are being built at Westrock and
 Closnamona. Those at Westrock are     
 replacing temporary{pre-fabricated    
{houses}erected after the war.         
    The three sets of four{town houses 
 being built on the Glen Road reflect  
 current trends in the building        
 industry.The houses have insulated    
 roof spaces,cavity walls and large    
 fitted kitchens.The type of heating   
 installed depends on the buyer's      
 preference.These houses are within    
 people's financial reach and are a new
 idea in private housing in this area. </content>
