 ever before.People could vote for     
{four different parties,the Democratic 
{Unionist Party, Ulster Unionist, Sinn 
{Fein}and the{Social Democratic Labour 
{Party.}This election used the P. R.   
 system which intended the voters to   
 number their choice of candidate by   
 1,2,3, etc. However some voters       
 spoiled their votes by using an X or  
 a tick which resulted in a lost vote.

 all remain in{Unionist control.}In    
 Dungannon Council areas the Ulster

 this year. In Cookstown the Ulster
