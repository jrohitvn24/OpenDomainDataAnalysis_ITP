		<title>17ENTERPRISE HOUSE</title>
		<content> The idea of Enterprise House is to    
 help the unemployed to start their own
 business. It was opened in May 1985.  
 The size of the building is 50000 sq. 
 feet. It took 2 years to prepare. The 
 cost was Â£750000 and it has 53 units. 
 Each person who owns a unit has to pay
 rent monthly. The rent varies from Â£14
 to Â£20 depending on the size. If your 
 business is not going well you only   
 have to stay until the end of the     
 month. A few of the ideas being put   
 into action are Comic Cuts display    
 boards,Cold Cast Metal and Commercial 
 Photography.                          
                                       
 The use of telex,photocopying and     
 telephone are available centrally so  
 that everyone can use them. There are 
 also facilities for the disabled.     
 There is an exhibition area to display
 the finished products.    LESLEY BOYLE</content>
