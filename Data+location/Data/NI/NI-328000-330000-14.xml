		<content> The majority of people in the area    
 live a very traditional lifestyle,    
 much as their parents did. The 'bright
 lights' are not overwhelmingly        
 attractive, although fewer children   
 stay on the farm as they grow up,     
 preferring to become tradesmen or work
 as employees. Rural Ulster is very    
 conservative in outlook; modern       
 innovations are viewed with suspicion.
 Eating habits lean heavily on a good  
 'fill of spuds' and maybe an Ulster   
 Fry. Potatoes are an essential part of
 the diet and are eaten in large       
 quantities, especially by farmers. The
 Ulster Fry would consist of fried     
 bacon, eggs, sausage, potato bread or 
 perhaps a soda farl (scone). All would
 be washed down by large quantities of 
 tea.
