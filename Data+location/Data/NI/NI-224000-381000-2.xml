		<title>02FARMING PART 1.</title>
		<content> Farming in the Castlederg area is     
 mainly restricted to grassland.       
 Because of this the main practice is  
 dairying and beef fattening.  In our  
 area we found that rough pasture and  
 grassland were of the same            
 proportions. Stock Rearing - the area 
 has several "marts" - markets for     
 selling and buying stock - although   
 most farmers would travel up to 50    
 miles to a market if the price was    
 right. Many farms supply direct to    
 meat factorys in Omagh (20 miles) and 
 Enniskillen (35 miles) which makes    
 this job more secure.
