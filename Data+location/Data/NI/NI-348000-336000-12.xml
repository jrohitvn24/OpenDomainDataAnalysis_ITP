		<content> The majority of the population in this
 area are Roman Catholic. The other    
 main demoninations are Anglican       
 (Church of Ireland) and Presybeterian.
 The parish is called the parish of    
 'Bright' for all religions. The       
 non_catholic population of the area   
 has declined and the Church of Ireland
 now share their Minister with the     
 surrounding parishes of Ardglass and  
 Strangford.                           
 The Roman Catholic population have    
 three churches in the parish, none of 
 which are situated in the area (one in
 Killough; Legamaddy; Rossglass).      
 The church of Ireland at Bright is a  
 very interesting building as in it was
 held the first Sunday School in       
 Ireland.
