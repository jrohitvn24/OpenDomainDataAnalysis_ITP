		<content>      Change in Hillsborough took place
 suddenly and with steadily gathering  
 momentum. By and by{the outside world 
{"discovered" Hillsborough,}came to    
 know it as the{residence of the       
{Governor,}came to appreciate the      
 existence of the{lake}as a place for a
 walk on a sunny day, and with a       
 growing interest in{local history and 
{architecture}attention turned towards 
 it.                                   
   {"Conservation"}became the vogue and
 it was recognised by experts that     
 Hillsborough was a gem on the doorstep
 of Belfast. So steps were taken to    
 restore old buildings, to control     
 change and to emphasise the historical
 quality and the beautiful environment.
 The Government took into their care   
 the{Market House}and the{Fort}and     
 visitors came to see it all, including
 the greatly appreciated{parish church.</content>
