		<title>10ROAD TRANSPORT IN DUNMURRY</title>
		<content> Communications in Dunmurry are very   
 good. Dunmurry is midway between      
 Belfast, the Capital City, and        
 Lisburn, a prosperous market town.    
 Kingsway, the main road through the   
 village, is always busy with cars,    
 buses and lorries, so we have to be   
 very careful when crossing it.        
 Dunmurry is only a 25 minute car ride 
 from Belfast International Airport,   
 and it takes even less time to reach  
 the docks and the Harbour Airport. The
 M1 motorway runs through Dunmurry,    
 crossing Kingsway by bridge.The M1    
 runs from Belfast to Dungannon,       
 serving the South and West. There are 
 six bus stops in Dunmurry's main      
 street, and each weekday 97 buses pass
 each way to Belfast and Lisburn.      
 This gives a regular 15 minute service
 most of the day.
