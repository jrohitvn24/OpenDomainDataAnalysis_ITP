		<content> The area is serviced by mains water   
 supply but only in 1985 when a special
 pumping device was installed has it   
 been possible for those in higher-up  
 regions of Glencull and Shantavney to 
 avail of this. A few years previous a 
 storage resevoir was built along the  
 Glencull Road but not at a sufficient 
 altitude to reach all households.     
  Dungannon District Council operate a 
 refuse disposal service once per week 
 in their area. Bins are left at the   
 roadside and the refuse collected by  
 lorry. Omagh District Council operate 
 a similar scheme in their area.       
  The whole area is serviced by        
 Northern Ireland Electricity Service  
 and all households are connected to   
 same. Some farmers have emergency     
 generators so that they can           
 cope,especially with milking,should   
 the mains supply fail.                </content>
