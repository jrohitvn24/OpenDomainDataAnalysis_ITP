		<content> For a small village Annalong has      
 churches representing four            
 denominations,the Presbyterian,Church 
 of Ireland, Brethren and Free         
 Presbyterian. The oldest is the       
 Presbyterian which is 145 years old.  
 The Church of Ireland on the Kilkeel  
 Road is 143 years old. The Brethren   
 church at the corner of the new estate
 is 54 years old and the Free          
 Presbyterian church is                
 relatively new being 40 years         
 old.                                  
 Most people seem to go to church in   
 the morning. For instance 275 go to   
 the Presbyterian in the morning and   
 100 at night.                         
 All raise money for charities and     
 missionaries.                         
 Most ministers say there are more     
 coming to church now than 10 years    
 ago, except the Presbyterian church. .</content>
