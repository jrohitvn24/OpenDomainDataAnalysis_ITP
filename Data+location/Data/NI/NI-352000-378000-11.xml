		<title>11 Clydesdale Horses 1</title>
		<content> My uncle John Drummond who lives on   
 the Dam Road,Cottown,Bangor keeps     
 Clydesdale horses.His father my       
 grandfather Peter Drummond worked with
 horses when he was a boy and when     
 tractors became popular he kept the   
 horses as a hobby to show at shows and
 ploughing matches.He also breeds and  
 keeps a stallion.When he is going to a
 show,the preparation starts a few     
 weeks before hand.The horses are      
 groomed and brushed every day.A few   
 days before the show thier feet are   
 washed so that the hair and           
 feathers,that is the hair round the   
 hoofs,are nice and white.The harness  
 has to be cleaned and polished,the    
 ribbons washed and ironed The night   
 before,the feet are washed again and  
 the mane and tail are plaited.
