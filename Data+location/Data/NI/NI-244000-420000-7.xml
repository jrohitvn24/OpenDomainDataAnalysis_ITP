      Boomhall was built in 1770,of    
 stone cut and has a large cubical     
 central hall and a polygonal bay      
 window on the East front.The house is 
 situated 2 miles north of Derry,where 
 there is a red object which marks the 
 spot where the famous Boom was placed 
 across the R.Foyle,by the English,to  
 prevent supply ships reaching Derry   
 during the Siege of 1689.The timber   
 boom,joined by iron chains and        
 fortified by a cable 12inches thick   
 twisted around it.It was fastened at  
 one end through the arch of a bridge, 
 at the other by a piece of stonework. 
 The boom was broken on the 28th July, 
 1689,by Mountjoy to release the city  
 of Derry.Today Boomhall House,is      
 derelict,but it presents an           
 interesting feature viewed from the   
 New Foyle Bridge.                     </content>
