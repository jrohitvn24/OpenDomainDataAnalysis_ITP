		<content> The majority of people in Ballycastle 
 are{Roman Catholic}although those in  
 the surrounding areas are mainly{     
{Protestant.}There are four churches in
 our area: there is one{Presbyterian}  
 church, two{Church of Ireland}churches
 and one{Roman Catholic}church; there  
 is also a Gospel Hall near the        
 hospital.                             
 The Roman Catholic church is on Moyle 
 Road, beside the two Catholic primary 
 schools and opposite Cross and Passion
 College. Marconi used the spire of    
 this church for his early wireless    
 work.                                 
 The Presbyterian church is on Castle  
 St. fairly near to the hospital.      
 The two Church of Ireland churches are
 in the Diamond and on the Ramoan Rd.  
 The older of the two,in the Diamond is
 opposite the Antrim Arms Hotel.
