		<content> On a beautiful sunny day a wedding    
 looks really spectacular. Everyone    
 is dressed in their best clothes.     
 Everyone feels very happy . The bride 
 comes with her father. Her father is  
 going to give her away to the groom   
 who will be her future husband.       
     There are lots of cameras         
 flashing, taking pictures of the      
 bride before she enters the church.   
 The choir sing "Here comes the bride".
 Then the priest says some prayers,    
 cameras still flashing.               
     The priest comes down from the    
 altar to perform the ceremony.First he
 blesses the rings and the coin.The    
 groom places the ring on the bride's  
 finger and the bride does likewise.The
 groom then gives the bride the coin   
 saying,"I give you this gold and      
 silver,tokens of all I possess."
