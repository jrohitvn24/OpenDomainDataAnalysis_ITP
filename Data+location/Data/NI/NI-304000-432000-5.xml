		<title>05FARMING AROUND ARMOY</title>
		<content>  I live on a farm and I enjoy helping 
 my dad .We have 21 cows ,120 sheep ,  
 20 bullocks and 20 heifers. We have   
 120 acres. It is not a very big farm, 
 some people have 200 or 300 acres.    
 We grow silage hay pototoes and       
 barley. Other farmers grow oil seed   
 rape or wheat or flax winter wheat and
 winter barley. There are not any very 
 big farms. Farmers  are putting in    
 silage. In the old days it was all    
 done by horses. They had no tractors  
 or combine harvesters but they had    
 some binders drawn by horse they      
 ploughed with 1 furrow ploughs. Now   
 you get 4 and 5 furrow plough. There  
 are a lot of farmers around Armoy. We 
 need contractors to help us to do the 
 work at busy times.                   
  Some people have other jobs but keep 
 a few sheep, cattle, pigs or hens.
