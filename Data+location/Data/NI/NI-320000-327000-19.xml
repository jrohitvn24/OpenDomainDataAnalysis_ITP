		<content> People's attitudes of Hilltown are as 
 follows;some people would like to stop
 vandalism.The benches around Hilltown 
 should be fixed and anyone caught     
 should be punished if they break      
 them.People should be stopped writing 
 rude things on walls and there should 
 be people employed to lift the litter 
 on the street like glass,crisps       
 bags,sweets papers and other          
 things.Some people break the speed    
 limit when they shouldn't and some    
 people would like a doctor's surgery  
 with a clinic for babies and sick     
 people.Hilltown needs a bank because  
 people  without cars can't get to any 
 bank and old people need alarms in    
 their houses because some bad boys    
 might break in and steal their money. 
 That is another reason for a bank to  
 keep their money safe.Most people     
 would like a pedestrian crossing      </content>
