		<content>   The water which is used to clean the
{sand and gravel}is piped into the     
{Rhone River}and that part of the river
 is very dangerous because if you put  
 one foot into it you would never be   
 able to get out of it.This is because 
 the water which has washed the gravel 
 and sand and is piped into the{Rhone  
  {River}contains{mud and clay}which   
 sinks to the bottom and forms a kind  
 of sinking sand bank.Putting straps   
 round the blocks to keep them together
 is a very{back_breaking}job even      
 though there is machinery to do       
 it.It is back_breaking because the man
 who does it always has to keep bent   
 down.It takes quite a bit of time as  
 well.It is a very messy job.
