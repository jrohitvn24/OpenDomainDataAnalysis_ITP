    The main road  route number A5 runs
 through the northern part of our area 
 for approximately four kilometres.    
   Most of this road has two           
 lanes but a small section known as    
 Ballymacilroy Hill has three lanes for
 lorries and tractors to climb.The two 
 lane section of the road was opened in
 1959 and the three lane section was   
 opened in 1974 .                      
    Ballymacilroy Hill starts at       
 Glencull Primary School and stretches 
 for about one kilometre.              
     This road carries local traffic   
 going from Ballygawley to Omagh but it
 is also part of the main route from   
 Dublin to Derry and for vehicles and  
 holiday makers going west to Donegal. 
   Approximately three hundred vehicles
 per hour pass along this route.
