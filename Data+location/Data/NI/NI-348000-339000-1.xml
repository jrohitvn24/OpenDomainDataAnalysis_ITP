		<content> The area of study lies to the south of
{DOWNPATRICK,}the county town of       
 Down,in the area known as Lecale.It is
 an entirely rural area and is         
 dominated by agricultaral             
 activity.There are no major roads of  
 note passing through the area,leaving 
 the countryside extremely peaceful    
 throughout the year.Life moves at an  
 easy pace with activity at its peak   
 during the summer months as the       
 farmers save their crops.The community
 is a tightly knit one and strangers to
 the area are sasily recognised.The    
 people are friendly and helpful and   
 typical of most rural farming areas.As
 there have been no major building     
 schemes the landscape has changed very
 little over the years.The major       
 changes have been in technology and   
 equipment on the farm and in the home.
