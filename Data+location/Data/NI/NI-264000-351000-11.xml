		<title>11Aughnacloy School Games</title>
		<content> Ten popular games played at the       
 Primary School are{British Bulldogs,  
{Football,Rounders,Kick the Can,       
{Computer Games,Tennis,Kiss the Catch, 
{Cops and Robbers}and{Chain Tag.       
     Each summer boys take part in a   
{7_a_side Football Tournament}in       
 Augher.This year two teams competed.  
 Although both teams played hard we did
 not succeed in gaining any awards.We  
 feel we are at a disadvantage because 
 our playground is not suitable for    
 laying out a full football pitch so we
 cannot have proper practice.Next year 
 our teacher hopes to arrange to use   
 the{Secondary School pitch}so we may  
 do better in 1986.                    
  { }We all enjoy playing{Rounders.}The
 batting side being the most popular.  
 Cheers go up when a full round is     
 scored or when the batting team is put
 out by a catch.                       </content>
