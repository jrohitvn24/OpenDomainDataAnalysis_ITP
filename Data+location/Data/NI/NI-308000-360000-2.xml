		<content>  Grass is the main crop grown in the  
 area and it is used for feeding       
 cattle. In the springtime more grass  
 is grown than is needed and the extra 
 grass is made into hay or silage. This
 is then stored away and used for      
 feeding cattle in the winter.         
   A large percentage of the cattle    
 raised is killed for beef.            
  The farmers buy in young cattle from 
 as far away as the west of Ireland and
 from local cattle marts.              
  The farmers sell the fattened cattle 
 to local butchers or to the meat      
 factory for export.                   
  As well as beef cattle, there are    
 several dairy herds, mainly Friesian. 
 The milk is sold to the local creamery
 which supplies milk to the surrounding
 area.        Ryan McGuinness
