		<title>10Lough Neagh Fishing</title>
		<content>  The fishermen in Lough Neagh catch   
 mostly eels. The fishing season starts
 at the first of May and ends at the   
 end of October. The three-man crew    
 goes out in a fibre-glass boat(25 feet
 long) driven by a diesel engine.      
   You are only allowed to catch eels  
 of 16 inches or over. Some days you   
 might catch 5 stone weight of eels and
 other days you might catch as much as 
 10 stone weight. It is easiest to     
 catch fish with the net,but the       
 fishermen also use long lines with    
 hooks. One fish is just as hard to    
 catch as the other. When you catch    
 them they are put in a barrel. They   
 are iced when they are sent to Toome  
 for export.                           
   The fishermen also catch other fish.
 There are 7 different kinds of fish in
 Lough Neagh.
