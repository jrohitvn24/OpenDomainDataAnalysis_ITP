		<title>19ROUND THE BRIDGES</title>
		<content> "Round the Bridges" is a fun run held 
 every year around the 20th June.  The 
 course is more than 10 miles and goes 
 over all the main bridges of the Roe  
 and its tributaries.  Last year I came
 in 19th in the Under Sixteen Section  
 taking 1 hour 22 minutes and 18       
 seconds while my dad was in 80th place
 of the Open Section taking only 1 hour
 10 minutes and 30 seconds.  When you  
 are nearing the end you are very tired
 and feel like giving up but we have   
 always managed to struggle on.  One   
 year my mum also took part, taking 2  
 hours 5 minutes and 50 seconds, but   
 she has sworn never to do it again.   
 She makes up by always coming around  
 in the car to cheer us on, and to give
 us a drink or a piece of chocolate.
