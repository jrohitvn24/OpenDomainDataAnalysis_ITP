		<content> As usual in a rural community,        
 change                                
 has come slowly. Until recent times   
 most local inhabitants did not travel 
 far during their lifetime. They found 
 employment in the Peninsula, mainly as
 farmers, and were reluctant to move   
 out of their familiar environment.    
  The Church is still a formidable     
 institution; most people attend their 
 church regularly esp. the Roman       
 Catholic Church. The Church provides  
 much of the Social Life in the area,  
 esp. bowling clubs, youth activities, 
 bingo &amp; organized events such as Fetes
 &amp; Gymkhanas during the summer.
