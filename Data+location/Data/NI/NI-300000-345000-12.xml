		<title>12   Newry Canal</title>
		<content>  The Newry canal was one of the first 
 canals to be built in the British     
 Isles.                                
                                       
  Oliver Cromwell was in control of    
 Ireland when the canal was first      
 planned and the countryside surveyed  
 for its costruction.Nothing was done  
 until in the early 18th century       
 deposits of coal were discovered in   
 Tyrone                                
                                       
  In 1733 the canal project was        
 started, and the linking of Coalisland
 in Tyrone and the port of Newry,      
 through Lough Neagh became possible.  
                                       
  The canal opened to traffic on 28th  
 March 1742 and was to be the first    
 major inland waterway in the British  
 Isles.It was 18 miles long, about 45  
 feet wide and 5 feet 6 inches deep.   </content>
