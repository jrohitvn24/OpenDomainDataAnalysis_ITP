		<content> In 1935 Gault's shop at Woodburn      
 crossroads was in the front room of   
 their house.  Billy Gault took over   
 the business from his parents in 1974 
 but still can remember the old shop   
 dealing "over the counter" and        
 weighing out bags of sugar, tea and   
 flour.  The till was a drawer under   
 the counter and he remembers using    
 ration books up to the early 1950's.  
 The shop used to have dried ling fish 
 and well-salted bacon hanging from the
 ceiling on hooks.  Cheese came in     
 30lb. blocks and biscuits were weighed
 out from large tins.  He introduced   
 self-service in 1960 to deal with the 
 growth of trade from the new housing  
 estates of Sunnylands and Woodburn.   
 In 1974 he introduced fancy goods,    
 clothing, toys, gas, coal and news-   
 papers. In l985 he added hardware and 
 D.I.Y supplies to his 1.5 acre site.  </content>
