		<title>05        DAIRY FARMING 1</title>
		<content> Dairy cattle are kept  for milking.The
 best dairy milking cow is a           
 Friesian.These days the cows are      
 usually milked by  machines.The milk  
 is sent to large dairies.A large milk 
 tanker comes every morning to collect 
 the milk from the farmiers .Cows are  
 fed on silage and hay.They are kept in
 houses and put out on the grass in the
 begining of May.Cows have to be kept  
 clean and dry.The milk has to pass    
 tests for hygiene and quality.If they 
 are testing the milk a man takes a    
 little bottle of milk.Then he gets a  
 long pipe and takes the milk from the 
 milk tank into the big tank in the    
 lorry.When the milk man is finished   
 collecting the milk he takes it to the
 creamery.At the creamery it is made   
 into butter and buttermilk.These are  
 sent to shops.
