		<title>05SAINTFIELD AGRICULTURAL SHOW</title>
		<content> The Saintfield Show first began over  
 forty years ago. It was started by a  
 group of people who made up the Young 
 Farmers' Club.They felt there was a   
 need for the Show as there was great  
 competition between farmers.The first 
 show was held at the cricket field,and
 was a small affair comprising of      
 cattle and horse judging and home     
 industries for the ladies.When we     
 spoke to one of the founder members,he
 told us that setting up the annual    
 event had meant very hard work for the
 committee.                            
  Today,the Agricultural Show is one of
 the most important shows in           
 Ireland,and people come from a wide   
 area to participate.There is judging  
 of cattle,sheep,horses,and pigs.Horse 
 jumping competitions now play an      
 important part.There are displays of  
 cooking,handicraft and flowerpressing.</content>
