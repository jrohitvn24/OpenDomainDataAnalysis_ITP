		<title>12Lord Mayor of Belfast</title>
		<content> Mr Carson is my next door neighbour   
 and was elected to be Lord Mayor by   
 the Belfast City Council in 1980 and  
 finished his term of office in 1981,  
 but has been re-elected to this office
 again for 1985-86.Outside the Lord    
 Mayor's home are two beautiful lamps  
 to signify his residence.  Mr Carson  
 tells me that he really enjoys being  
 Lord Mayor and his most memorable     
 occasion was a visit to Buckingham    
 Palace to meet Her Majesty the Queen.
