 lazily and stumble down to the kitchen
 to get my coffee and toast.After I get
 my breakfast I get my swimming gear   
 ready and then get dressed.mummy was

 After we have done our shopping my mum
 leaves me at my friends house.We walk 
 down to the swimming pool in          
 Downpatrick Leisure Centre.We have a  
 really good time at the swimming pool 
 and sometimes we happen to meet some  
 old friends.We stay in the swimming   
 until 2.30pm.Then we all go down in   
 the town and have our lunch,we have
