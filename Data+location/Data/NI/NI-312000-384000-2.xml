		<content> The major employer in Antrim was the  
 giant artificial fibre factory BRITISH
 ENKALON.Although located outside our  
 study area many of the workforce lived
 inside our area.At its peak Enkalon   
 employed over 2000 people and when it 
 closed four years ago 1500 people lost
 their jobs. This was a devastating    
 blow to the N.Ireland economy and on  
 June 17th 1985 the Dutch owned parent 
 company ENKA announced that they were 
 giving a Â£1000000 gift to benefit     
 charitable projects in N.Ireland. This
 gift is unique in industrial          
 relations. The interest is to be      
 donated annually to alleviate distress
 aggravated by unemployment especially 
  among the families of former Enkalon 
 employees. The employment figures for 
 Antrim closely resemble the figures   
 for the whole of N.I.
