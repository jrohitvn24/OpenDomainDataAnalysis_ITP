		<content>  Lack of public transport in this part
 of Co. Down has always been a problem.
 The railways stopped at Newtownards &amp; 
 Donaghadee; the inhabitants of the    
 Ards have had to rely on other forms  
 of land transport. Today the national 
 bus service ULSTERBUS provides a daily
 service to and from its depots in     
 Portaferry, Newtownards &amp; Belfast.    
 Most families in this specified area  
 seem to have access to a family car   
 and the buses are frequently          
 travelling empty. Transporting school 
 children is probably the most         
 lucrative business for the company.   
 It is not surprizing that the service 
 is sparse and irregular especially at 
 weekends and holiday times.           
 The roads are narrow and footpaths    
 few. Fatal road accidents at regular  
 intervals have caused concern and     
 protest but improvement is slow.      </content>
