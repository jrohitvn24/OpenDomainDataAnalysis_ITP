		<title>13HISTORY IN NEWTOWNARDS</title>
		<content> The Normans came to this area in ll77 
 and built the first town. This        
 declined and when the Scots came in   
 l606 a new town was built by Hugh     
 Montgomery. In l770 the town was      
 rebuilt with the market house and the 
 square and four new streets, North,   
 South, East and West Street. Movilla  
 Abbey was founded by St. Finnian in   
 the 6th Century, destroyed by the     
 Vikings in 824 and refounded by       
 Augustinian Canons in the l2th        
 Century. The Old Priory was founded by
 the Dominican Monks in the l3th       
 Century. The Market Cross was erected 
 in l636 where Greenwell Street,       
 Movilla Street and Market Street met. 
 The Market House was built in l775    
 using Scrabo Stone. It had a large    
 archway in the centre used as a road  
 and was used for dances, meetings and 
 other functions.                      </content>
