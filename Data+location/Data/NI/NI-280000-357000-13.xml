		<title>13   The Dungannon By-pass</title>
		<content> This road, an{extension of the M1,}was
 opened by{Mr.Goodhart,M.P.,Minister of
{the Environment,}in{October I980.}He  
 cut the tape between two flyover      
 bridges at{Stangmore}in a downpour of 
 rain.                                 
 The new road cost over {5 millon      
{pounds}and was built to speed up the  
 motorist's journey to the west of the 
 province by avoiding{narrow streets in
{Dungannon}and the infamous{bends on   
{the Ballygawley road. }In 1980, it was
 estimated that the new road would mean
{a saving}to the community in running  
 costs and journey times of{Â£850 000   
{annually.}In its construction, large  
 quantities of soil had to be moved,   
 1.5 million cubic metres, and over    
 half of it was used in the            
 construction of{embankments.}This new 
 road was welcomed by all, with the    
 exception of a few farmers.           </content>
