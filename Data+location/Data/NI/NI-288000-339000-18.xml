		<content> Spectators numbering 30000 and        
 standing 3 or 4 deep, line the entire 
 route of 3 miles to the{Demonstration 
{Field}which has large marquees and    
 stalls selling refreshments. In this  
 field band instruments and the{large  
{painted banners}with pictures of King 
 William on one side, and the lodge's  
 local Church or portrait of a late    
 member on the other, are placed       
 carefully near a hedge.               
    All members and their families then
 have tea and sandwiches in one of the 
 large tents after which they sit in   
 groups or walk around talking to      
 friends or resting. Children eat fruit
 and ice cream and drink minerals while
 some men have a few beers with        
 friends. Some band members in their   
 colourful uniforms practise tunes and 
 guard their instruments in the field.
