		<content> Orangefield Boys &amp; Girls Schools,     
 Orangefield Primary, and Robert Bell  
 Primary which closes in 1985 due to   
 low numbers. We have two churches on  
 the Castlereagh Road. These are St    
 John's Church of Ireland and          
 Orangefield Presbyterian Church. We   
 are well catered for as far as        
 recreational facilities are concerned.
 There are many parks for walks and    
 plenty of playing fields for sports   
 such as rugby, hockey and soccer.     
 There is also a swimming pool on the  
 Montgomery Road in a centre also      
 housing squash courts. Historically   
 the children of Orangefield Primary   
 School are quite proud of the fact    
 that their school was used as a       
 prisoner of war camp and also a       
 military hospital. The building re-   
 opened as a school in 1946.Items      
 interest were found in the main hall. </content>
