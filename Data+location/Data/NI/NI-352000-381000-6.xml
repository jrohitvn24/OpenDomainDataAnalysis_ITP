		<title>06WHAT WE DO ON SATURDAYS</title>
		<content>   On Saturday mornings in the Summer I
 have been going to the tennis coaching
 in Ward Park in Bangor.This lasts for 
 6 weeks altogether.For the past two   
 weeks we have been playing in a       
 tournament.I am still in and I play my
 fourth round match next week.A lot of 
 girls from Towerview School go to the 
 tennis but only a few of us are still 
 in the tournament.                    
     During the afternoons I don't     
 really do anything.I used to play     
 badminton at Ballyholme Methodist     
 Church but that's over for the summer.
     My Dad usually goes to golf on    
 Saturdays at Bangor Golf Club.My Mum  
 goes shopping in Ballyholme in the    
 morning and my brother is sometimes to
 be found out in the garage painting   
 his models.                           
                                       
                                       </content>
