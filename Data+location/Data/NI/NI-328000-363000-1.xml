		<title>01General Overview</title>
		<content> This area is somewhat disappointing as
 it is an agricultural area singularly 
 lacking in amenities and about which  
 very little can be said.  It is       
 essentially a peripheral area fringing
 in the north east on a rather         
 exclusive Belfast commuter belt and in
 the west on Hilden and other          
 extensions of Lisburn, a market town  
 which in recent years has mushroomed  
 to 83,000 people.  Settlement is      
 generally linear and sporadic         
 farmhouses punctuate the landscape.   
                                       
 The area is not highly industrialised,
 the only large scale employer being a 
 local textile mill. Its peace         
 tranquility and unspoilt beauty are a 
 growing attraction for city dwellers  
 and any homes coming on the market are
 quickly sold.                         
                                       </content>
