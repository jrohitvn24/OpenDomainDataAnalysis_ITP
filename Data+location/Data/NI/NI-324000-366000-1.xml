		<content>  This area is situated on the west    
 side of the{Lagan Valley.}It is on the
 fringe of the outer suburbs of{       
{Belfast.}Much of the housing is       
 dormitory to{Belfast}and{Lisburn.     
  In the north-west of this            
 "D-block",there is a lot of Whinstone 
 quarrying.                            
  About 20% of the population in this  
 area are un-employed.Most of the other
 80% work in{Belfast}or{Lisburn.}      
  There has been quite a lot of housing
 development in this area since 1960   
 both in council housing estates and , 
 more especially , private developments
 along the axis of the valley bottom.  
 However,most of the area is still     
 covered with{intensively managed      
{grassland.  SEE **NOTE**              
  Population densities decrease from   
 moderate in the S.E.to low in the N.W.
 where the land is hilly and quarried. </content>
