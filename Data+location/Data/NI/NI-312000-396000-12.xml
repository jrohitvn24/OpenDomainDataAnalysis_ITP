		<title>12A Day With My Dad</title>
		<content> My Dad goes to work at half eight in  
 the morning .He is a building         
 contractor .His day is going to people
 to see what he can do with their      
 houses.He can build a house in four   
 months or maybe more and he can put   
 windows and panes of glass.He has lots
 of people to go to  some would just   
 want tiling done in bathrooms some    
 would want him to fix a leak in the   
 pipes and some would want him to do up
 the fireplace to make it look nice.He 
 comes home from work at six oclock and
 then goes back to work at half seven.
