		<content>{Clonoe Gaelic Football Club was       
{founded in 1916 and named after one of
{the Rebels in the 1916 Easter Rising.}
 It was not  until the 1940's that the 
 Clonoe team became firmly established 
 in Gaelic football. In 1941 Clonoe    
 reached the County final for the first
 time and was beaten by St. Malachy's  
 Moortown. The 1950's was Clonoe's     
 most successful decade, with the      
 offical opening of O'Rahilly Park in  
 1952 and a place in the County Finals 
 in '52,'53,'56,'58 &amp; '59. In 1958     
 Clonoe defeated Carrickmore in the    
 Final and the arrival of{The O'Neill  
{Cup}at 'the Corner' became a reality. 
 The 1960's were also successful for   
 Clonoe with wins in '60, '61, &amp; '65.  
 In 1973 the new{ Social Club }was     
 opened and a reserve team formed which
 won the Inter. Championship in 1983.
