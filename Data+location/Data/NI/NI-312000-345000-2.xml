		<title>02HOUSING IN BANBRIDGE</title>
		<content> The town has an equal division of     
 private sector housing and those owned
 by the Housing Executive, which has   
 taken over the responsibilities of the
 District Council in this matter.In    
 recent years, especially the period   
 1971-1981, when Banbridge had the     
 largest growth rate of any town in    
 Northern Ireland,there has been great 
 pressure on available building land,  
 resulting in considerable increases in
 house prices.Most development has     
 taken place on the outskirts of the   
 town to cater for the population      
 influx.Reasonable care has been taken 
 to create attractive estates and apart
 from older buildings in the town      
 centre, housing stock is in good      
 condition.Housing is almost           
 invariably detached or semi-detached  
 in the private sector and terraced in 
 the public sector.                    </content>
