		<title>05BALLYEASTON CHURCHES</title>
		<content>    A church was built in{Ballyeaston  
 in 1676 by the early{Scottish settlers
 who  farmed the area. Therefore {First
{Ballyeaston }is   one  of  the {oldest
{Presbyterian congregations in Ireland.
 The present church is the 3rd building
 on the original site and  was  erected
 in 1834.The site is very prominent and
 gives an uninterrupted view for  miles
 along the Sixmile Water valley.       
    When it was established it was  the
 only church between Connor and  Larne,
 and is considered to be the mother  of
 many other churches in  the  district,
 one of which is{Second Ballyeaston.   
    This is a  relative newcomer to the
 churches in  the  area, being built in
 1903 to service the needs of the large
 number of presbyterians in the area.  
    There  is  also  a ruined church in
 Ballyeaston which was built about 1787
 and destroyed by fire some years later</content>
