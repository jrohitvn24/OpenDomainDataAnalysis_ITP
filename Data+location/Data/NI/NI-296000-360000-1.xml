		<title>01Lower Course of Upper Bann</title>
		<content> This block is a low lying area across 
 which the Upper Bann river meanders   
 and finally in the north west corner  
 enters Lough Neagh. There are in the  
 area a few small scattered hills which
 may rise to 50ft. These are called    
 drumlins and were deposited by ice    
 sheets. On heir slopes pasture        
 predominates, but there are also a few
 small apple orchards on the well      
 drained slopes with sunny aspects.    
 the intervening depressions are water 
 logged.  The resulting rough pasture  
 is used for grazing cattle.  The      
 slopes of the drumlins provide dry    
 sites for the farm dwellings and      
 roads. The pattern of settlement is a 
 scattered one with the exception of   
 the single village of Derry Trasna.   
 Patches of scrub woodland including   
 willow trees, occur here and there.
