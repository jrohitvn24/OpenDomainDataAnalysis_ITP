		<content> I interviewed James McCrory who is    
 eighty seven years old.He lives with  
 his neice,Cassie,in Roscavey.James was
 born where he now lives.There were    
 twelve children in his family.He went 
 to Roscavey old school.The{teachers   
 then were Master McGrath and Annie    
 Hackett who later married Mr.Rodgers. 
 When Master McGrath left Master Fyffe 
 came.His favourite subject was        
 arithmetic which we call{mathematics. 
 He enjoyed counting the marbles at the
 front of the class.It was a very small
 school and since there were over      
 seventy five pupils there were not    
 enough seats.The pupils who had no    
 seats stood around the walls.One of   
 his childhood memories was that he    
 broke his arm playing football when   
 someone jumped on him.The master took 
 him to hospital.He went to school on  
 bare feet from 1st May to 1st November</content>
