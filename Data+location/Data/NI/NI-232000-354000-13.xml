		<title>13HISTORICAL BACKROUND</title>
		<content>In the {seventh century} Trillick had  
an abbey and it is thought the O'Neills
had a kind of fort there. The Earl of  
Castlehaven built a castle {around     
1630} and gave 2000 acres to his       
son-in-law Sir Henry Mervyn M.P It is  
to this   family that the village owns 
it's origin.In {1777} when his family  
died out the estate passed to a        
relation,Mervyn Archdale of            
Co.Fermanagh.  {The ruins of the       
Castle Trillick lie to the north of    
the town.} Close to this are six       
pillar stones are the remains of a     
stone circle.It is thought that the    
village is named after these stones.   
{The name Trillick is derived from     
"Tri-liaga" which means "Three         
Remarkable Stones ".}                  
                                       
The present village is a landlord      
creation of the {eighteenth century.}  </content>
