		<title>15ELY LODGE</title>
		<content> The  present house in which the       
{Duchess of Westminster}lives used to  
 be the stables of the original Lodge  
 which was situated on a hill above the
 stables.Ely Lodge was used by the     
 Americans during the{Second World War.
 You can still see proof of their      
 occupation on the island,the          
 cinema,the cookhouse,the assault      
 course in the forest and all the      
 concrete paths.The Lodge was bought by
 Mr. Cathcart after the War; he then   
 sold it to Col. Grosvenor.When he died
{Col Grosvenor}left the property to his
 wife and an island to each of his     
 children.The{ghost}of old{Lord Ely}is 
 supposed to haunt the Lodge but as yet
 has not been seen by anyone.In the    
 summer the gardens are open to the    
 public.
