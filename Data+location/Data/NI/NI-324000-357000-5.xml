		<content> Hillsborough takes it's name from{Sir 
{Arthur Hill}who, in about{1650,}built 
{Hillsborough Fort}which, with it's    
 eight foot high earth ramparts and    
 stone revetments looks proudly out    
 over the town.{King Charles the Second
 made this a royal fortress and Sir    
 Arthur was constable with twenty      
 warders.                              
     The Fort commanded the strategic  
 pass of{Kilwarlin}and was used in{1690
 by{William the Third}on his way to the
{Battle of the Boyne.}The room in which
 he slept remains today.               
     The{gatehouse}is an impressive    
 rectangular two-storey structure of   
 rubble masonry with brick dressings   
 and battlements and tall square corner
 towers.                               
     Many people in the past years have
 visited the Fort and the lake nearby.
