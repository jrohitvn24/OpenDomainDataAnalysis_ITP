		<title>14Home Life in Dungiven</title>
		<content> The standard of living is quite good. 
 Most families have a car,a            
 T.V.,fridge/freezer,washing machine   
 and other "essentials".Many families  
 also have video recorders and home    
 computers.Most manage to have a       
 holiday away each year.At home,father 
 is head of the family,though many     
 mothers have part time jobs to        
 increase the family income.The evening
 meal is the main one of the day when  
 working members and children who      
 attend school outside the area ,come  
 home.Food tends to be traditional with
 potatoes and meat considered          
 essential.The fish and chip shop and  
 the new Chinese restaurant have become
 very popular.The main relaxation is   
 watching T.V.or a visit to the        
 pub.Parental concern would be for     
 teenagers unable to find employment   
 and drifting towards illegal activity.</content>
