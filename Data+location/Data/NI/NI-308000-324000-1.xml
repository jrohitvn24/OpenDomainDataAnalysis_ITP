 less than five years old,five are     
 between five and ten years old        
 and three are over ten years old.The  
 first factory in the Estate was Ulster
 Textiles.The largest factory is Glen  
 Electrics.Originally Glen Electrics   
 had 150 workers.Now it has 600,the    
 largest number of workers in the      
 Estate.                               
      Eight factories have closed down 
 because of lack of money or they could
 not sell their products,or had bad    
 managment.There are many small        
 factories,one of which makes furniture
 and employs six workers.
