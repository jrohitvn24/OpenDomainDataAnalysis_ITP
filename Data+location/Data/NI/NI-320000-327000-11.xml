		<content> Hilltown functions as a small service 
 centre and has recently become        
 attractive for housing development.The
 population has grown from seven       
 hundred and ninety nine in 1976 to    
 nine hundred and thirteen in          
 1985.Since 1976 Ardmore Park was      
 built.It consists of about twenty to  
 thirty houses and it is nearly all    
 families who live there.Up the Newry  
 road a private estate has been        
 built.It is called Oakridge           
 Avenue.There are 7 houses and again it
 is nearly all families who live       
 there.Now and again some private      
 houses have been built especially in  
 Leitrim which is the area where I     
 live.In Hilltown the population the   
 population increases from 20 to 30    
 each year.This includes people coming 
 from Cabra,Mayobridge,Rathfriland and 
 Newry.  BY CARMEL DEVLIN              </content>
