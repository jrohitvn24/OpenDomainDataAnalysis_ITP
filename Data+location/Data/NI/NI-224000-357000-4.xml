		<content>    The playschool opens at 10 o'clock 
 and closes at 12 o'clock. At 11       
 o'clock the children get milk and     
 biscuits. After that they sing songs  
 and say poems. The children's         
 favourite song is "I'm a little       
 teapot". They also read stories and   
 the teacher shows them pictures. If   
 they play with water they have to wear
 aprons to protect their clothes from  
 getting wet. The play school enables  
 the children to prepare for primary   
 school and helps them to play along   
 with other children.                  
 There are many toys. Some are         
 made, some are given by older children
 and some are donated.
