		<content> A new {Health Centre}opened in July   
 1985 in the Castle grounds.Here       
{Doctors Maraswamy,Johnstone and Byrne}
 hold daily clinics. There is a baby   
 clinic where vaccinations,weighing    
 babies and problems concerning babies 
 are dealt with.A speech therapist     
 attends each Monday and Wednesday.A   
 clinic for minor emergencies,dressings
 etc.is also available.There is some   
 disappointment that there are no      
 dental or chiropody clinics.Old people
 and babies are visited in their homes 
 by a Health Visitor or a District     
 Nurse.Serious emergencies are referred
 to {Altnagelvin Hospital}twenty miles 
 away.Less urgent patients and the     
 elderly are catered for in Limavady's{
{Roe Valley Hospital}nine miles away.  
 Meals on Wheels are delivered by      
 voluntary workers to eldery and infirm
 people in the district.               </content>
