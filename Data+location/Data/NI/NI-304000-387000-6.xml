		<content> THE AREA IS BOUNDED BY LOUGH NEAGH,   
 THE LARGEST  LAKE IN THE BRITISH      
 ISLES. FOR GENERATIONS FAMILIES ALONG 
 THE SHORE HAVE EARNED THEIR LIVING BY 
 FISHING FOR EELS.                     
                                       
   THE WATERS OF THE LOUGH ARE USED TO 
 SUPPLY VARIOUS INDUSTRIES, AS A WATER 
 SUPPLY FOR THE CITY OF BELFAST, AND   
 FOR RECREATION AND SPORTING           
 FACILITIES.                           
                                       
   CLAY AND SAND ARE BOTH DREDGED  FROM
 THE LOUGH. CLAY IS USED IN POTTERY AND
 FOR THE MAKING OF BRICKS AND PIPES.   
 SAND IS USED IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY.
                                       
   MARINAS ARE BEING BUILT AT VARIOUS  
 PLACES ALONG THE SHORE FOR TOURISTS   
 WHO PREFER THE LOUGH SHORE TO THE     
 SEASIDE.                              
                                       </content>
