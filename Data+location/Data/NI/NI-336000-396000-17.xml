		<content> We have one National Trust property in
 our area. It is the waterfall at      
 Glenoe. There is small walk near the  
 waterfall and around the small valley 
 the water created.                    
 In Raloo is a very old graveyard which
 attracts visitors. In this graveyard  
 are the remains of an old church which
 was derelict in 1622. The oldest grave
 we can find  is  dated 1691 and the   
 most recent is 1982.                  
 In our area we have various standing  
 stones and a field which is known as  
 Bruce's Field because it is said that 
 Robert the Bruce fought a battle      
 there.                                
 This field is at the back of Shaw's   
 Farm.
