		<title>05YOUNG ORNITHOLOGIST CLUB</title>
		<content>     I  am  a  member  of   the  {Young
{ Ornathologist Club.} It is held twice
 a  month.  One  week we have a talk or
 quiz inside and the next time we go on
 an  outing.  The  Y.O.C.  is  held  in
 school from 3.00 p.m. until  4.00 p.m.
   I am the treasurer of  it.  We  also
 have a shop which Tanya McMillan and I
 run. Mr Evans who put the  idea to the
 children is present  as  well. We have
 been on a  trip  to  the {rookery } at
 Mrs  Gilbert's  corn mill and the Bird
{Sanctuary }at  Carrickfergus   Leisure
 Centre .We have twenty one members who
 have  joined.  When they  joined  they
 received a beautiful  sew  on  kestrel
{badge} and also a membership card. All
 of the boys and  girls  love  going to
 Y.O.C. and enjoy  it very much indeed.
