		<title>10ROUND THE BRIDGES RACE</title>
		<content>                                       
   Each year in June for the last three
years this race has taken place. About 
four or five hundred people enter the  
ten mile race.                         
   It is intended mainly for fun though
if you were to see the competitors     
finishing the race you might not       
believe that they were enjoying        
themselves.                            
   The race begins at Limavady Town    
Hall then contiues east towards        
Aghanloo, North towards Magilligan past
St. Anthony's School. Then you turn    
west towards Limavady again and back to
the Town Hall. In all three bridges are
crossed.                               
   No matter how poor the weather it is
surprising how many turn up to run in  
or spectate at this event.
