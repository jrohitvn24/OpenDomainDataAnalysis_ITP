		<title>01General Review of Block</title>
		<content> The area covered in this block is     
 mostly farmland,fenced or otherwise   
 enclosed and used for grazing.Sheep   
 are the main income,this is reflected 
 in Donemana having the largest sheep  
 market in Northern Ireland.           
 The village of Donemana is located in 
 one corner of the block and has a     
 population of approximately 2,000.    
 Alongside farming,Donemana and the    
 surrounding area prides itself in its 
 many sports.Cricket is the main sport 
 and is followed with great enthusiasm 
 by young and old                      
 Places of interest include Earlsgift  
 Castle built in the 17th Century and  
 Raspberry Hill Health Farm where      
 people attempt to lose weight.The     
 two Churches and Chapel are also of   
 interest,where design is both old and 
 modern.
