		<title>04ANTRIM'S MAYOR</title>
		<content> There has been a Mayor in Antrim for  
 eight years ever since the town became
 a borough. Mr.Allen himself has been  
 leader or Antrim Council for thirteen 
 years and has enjoyed all the years as
 Mayor of Antrim. His chain of office  
 was donated to Antrim by British      
 Enkalon when Antrim became a borough  
 and it is made of gold. It is kept in 
 the Council offices at the Steeple and
 it is worth eight to ten thousand     
 pounds.Mr.Allen thinks that the main  
 aspect of being mayor is to be able to
 lead his council strictly, he also    
 thinks that the most enjoyable part of
 his job is being able to meet strange 
 people.The changes over Mr.Allen's    
 years as mayor have been tremendous.  
 The village started with 4000 people  
 and increased quickly to OVER 25000.  
 Mr.Allen sums up his years as exciting
 and interesting.                      </content>
