		<title>20LIMAVADY TECHNICAL COLLEGE</title>
		<content> The Limavady Technical College opened 
 in 1909.  The number of students has  
 increased since then and it draws     
 pupils from a{wide radius.            
{The courses}available range from      
 catering to brickwork and masonry,    
 culminating in a wide range of        
 qualifications such as City and Guilds
 and 'A' levels. {Recreational         
{activities}like rugby, tennis, hockey 
 and others are not neglected, leading 
 to many inter-school matches.         
 Pupils and teachers find the school   
 pleasant and rewarding.  Over the     
 years the college has had many        
 extensions but the new building has   
 all the aims of the original school.
