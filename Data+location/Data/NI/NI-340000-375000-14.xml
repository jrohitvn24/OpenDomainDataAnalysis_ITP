 On Thursday night runs disco but on   
 any other night there is nothing.     
 Ballyoran School which is closing     
 might be opening as a youth club which
 will be a very good thing because the 
 young people are badly in need of one.
     I attend D.B.H.S which is a very  
 good school. It has facilities which  
 are second to none but I do not think 
 these facilities are used enough. The 
 teachers, in general, are very good.  
 But I think some of them do not take a
 lot of interest in the pupils. There  
 are too many pupils in one class so   
 each pupil does not get enough        
 attention. We have a swimming pool    
 which is seldom used by the pupils of 
 the school and we do not even have a  
 sport's day which is a disgrace. Not  
 many of the teachers seem interested  
 in extra-curricular activities.       </content>
