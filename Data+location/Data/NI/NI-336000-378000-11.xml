 The font is at the back and it is used
 for christening babies.  Just beside  
 the altar is where the choir sits and 
 each choir member has a little lamp.  
                                       
 Outside you can see where the new part
 of the church was built in 1871.  The 
 old and new styles of architecture are
 completely different.  There is also a
 clock which needs repairing.  It will 
 cost Â£1,200 to repair.  The fact which
 I thought was very interesting was    
 that, when the church was built, at   
 first it was worth Â£1,800, now the    
 insurance men value it at Â£3.5        
 million.
