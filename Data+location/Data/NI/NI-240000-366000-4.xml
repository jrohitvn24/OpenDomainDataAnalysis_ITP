		<content> Ballynahatty today is no more than a  
 most pleasant,quiet and extremely     
 rural townland.Yet it could have been 
 a busy urban community,the county town
 of Tyrone if planners in the 1740's   
 had had their way.                    
            Omagh had been burned to   
 the ground for the second time and    
 people of wealth and influence wanted 
 the new town to be sited at           
 Ballynahatty.                         
          It is easy to see why.The    
 area contains several high points     
 making it easily defensible.There is a
 river affording a supply of water     
 which is easily fordable or bridged.  
 The land in the area,especially to the
 east and north provides better farming
 facilities.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
