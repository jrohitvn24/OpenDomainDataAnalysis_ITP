{HISTORIC BUILDINGS:}SHANES CASTLE is  
 part of the local history.The estate  
 can be found on the N.E.corner of     
 Lough Neagh.The O'Neills of Clannaboye
 were the original owners.A three gauge
 steam train has been installed in the 
 estate and a deer park.Woodlands have 
 grown up and they are full of         
 hares,rabbits,foxes and other wild    
 creatures.A nature reserve has been   
 set up along with bird watches.Heron  
 and Kingfisher are the most common    
 birds to be seen.                     
{THE ROUND TOWER AND WITCHES STONE}    
 People argue over when the round tower
 was built but it was probably built in
 the early seventh century.It is an    
 almost perfect example of an Irish    
 "cloc-tee"(belt house) pointing       
 heavenward.
