		<title>13FASHIONS IN NEWRY.</title>
		<content> One of the fashions for hairstyles    
 today is the bob this is a fringe on  
 the forehead and the rest of the hair 
 straight down then turned under at the
 ears.People get their hair spiked,that
 is standing straight up on your       
 head.You do this by putting special   
 gel on your hair or by putting sugar  
 and water on the roots.When the hair  
 is standing up you spray different    
 colours on it.Some boys get their     
 heads shaved and wear stud earrings in
 their ears.Girls get their hair       
 streaked blonde and then spike it.    
    The jewellery now is big and thick.
 They wear diamond jewellery and very  
 big earrings.Boys wear neck bands and 
 wrist bands,these are made of small   
 beads or artificial teeth.
