		<content>    Tourism on Lough Erne has increased
 greatly  in the last decade.Although  
 there is only one passenger carrying  
 vessel on Lough Erne,there are seven  
 companies which  hire out cruisers.   
 The passenger carrying vessel is      
 called the{KESTREL}and leaves the     
{"ROUND O"}pier daily during the summer
 months.There is a Ferry boat service  
 at{TRORY}4 miles from Enniskillen and 
 this carries passengers to{DEVENISH   
{ISLAND.}                              
      As well as staying on the lakes  
 in{cruisers,}tourists may stay in many
 hotels,chalets,guest houses and       
 farmhouses.                           
  { } Approximately 350 cruisers per   
 day pass through the{lough gates:}70% 
 of these are {German};the remainder   
 are largely {Swiss,British and Irish.
