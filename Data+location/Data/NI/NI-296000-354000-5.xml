		<title>05APPLE PRODUCTION</title>
		<content>   County Armagh is well known for its 
 long-established and successful apple 
 production - indeed it is often       
 referred to as the{"Orchard County"}. 
 One of the reasons for this success is
 the{drumlin}countryside,since the     
 orchards are planted on the           
 south-facing slopes. The area we      
 studied is very typical with its many{
{apple orchards}-over 30,in fact. Apple
 production does not consist only of   
 harvesting;it involves year-round     
 work.                                 
   There are FOUR stages -             
{PRUNING.}This is done during the      
 "dormant" season-December,January and 
 February. The objects of pruning      
 are:(a)to build up and maintain the   
 shape and form of the tree:(b)to      
 prevent overcrowding of branches:     
 (c)to regulate the number of fruit    
 buds which are allowed to develop.    </content>
