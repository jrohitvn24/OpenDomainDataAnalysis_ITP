		<content>    In this area around  Ballynure and 
 Ballyeaston there are different types 
 of  agriculture. Most farmers rely on 
 the{ready supply of good grass}either 
 for the production of{silage and hay, 
 or for grassing their stock.          
    The majority of farmers have{dairy 
{cows}as the  main  source  of income, 
 but few rely on this enterprise alone.
    Grassland covers over half  of the 
 land. Rough grazing  is the next most 
 popular  land  use. On  this  kind of 
 grass  sheep are the most common farm 
 animals.Arable is next and these  are 
 crops  like wheat and barley. Next on 
 the list is  uncultivated grass. This 
 is land which has never been ploughed 
 and grass grows here every  year.Beef 
 cattle  and sheep usually graze here.
