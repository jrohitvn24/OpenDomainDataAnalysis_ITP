		<content> After farming and fishing the         
 other main occupations are connected  
 with the building                     
 industry;plastering,plumbing,joinery ,
 bricklayingand so on.We have a number 
 offactories scattered about in the    
 business of making furniture,         
 processing fish,manufacturing concrete
 products.With so many people in the   
 building business ,a lot of them have 
 built their own homes.Indeed the      
 majority of the population own or are 
 buying their houses.These houses      
 mostly bungalow types,are spread out  
 over the whole area and would make up 
 a fair sized town if gathered         
 together.There are several small      
 housing estatesowned by the NORTHERN  
 IRELAND HOUSING EXECUTIVE,built within
 the last 15 to20 years.Very few of the
 old farmhouse or cottage types are    
 left.                                 </content>
