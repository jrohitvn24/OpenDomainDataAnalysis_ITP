		<content> SCHOOLING                             
 Like today, at the age of 5 people    
years ago started school, but left at  
the age of 14, not 16.  School lasted  
for six hours and there was half an    
hour break. Unlike today  there were   
holidays at every farming season of the
year.  They also got off school to go  
potato gathering.                      
 There was only one big room.  The fire
was at the front, and the youngest     
people sat at the front and the elder  
people sat at the back along with the  
children who were naughty, or those who
didn't bring any fuel for the fire.    
They wrote on slates with chalk. The   
old people envied today's facilities.  
                                       
 ENTERTAINMENT                         
 Kids played hide and seek and marbles 
because they had very few toys.
