		<title>09Development of the area</title>
		<content> Historically this area was once one of
 hillforts and iron age settlements but
 the twentieth century has seen it     
 withdraw into a quiet, very rural     
 "outside of town".  The paucity of    
 primary and the absence of secondary  
 schools in the area together with the 
 lack of new housing developments      
 ensure its lasting tranquility.       
 Certain of the roads are notable as   
 old coaching roads with some early    
 eighteenth century housing still in   
 the hands of the same families -      
 namely those on the Hillhall Road.    
 Other settlements like the former     
 villages of Hilden and the Plantation 
 have joined the Lisburn urban sprawl. 
 Current "green belt" planning         
 legislation will protect the rural    
 character of the area.
