		<content> Mr.Johnston was born in 1909 in       
 Rossglass.He lived in Rossglass for a 
 while and then moved to Killough.     
 He went to school in Legamaddy until  
 he was 14.Then he left school and went
 to look for a job.As school was hard  
 he was glad to get out.He went to work
 as a motor mechanic.He got Â£2.00 for  
 his salary.Times have changed from    
 those dayThere was no discos or youth 
 clubs.Food was bought from one of the 
 local shops such as Gibsons and       
 Montgomereys or from a van.The        
 Killough brickyard was the only       
 factory in the area and still is.     
 Mr. Johnston now 76 still remembers   
 when a boat was wrecked in the harbour
 and coal was washed up  onto the sand.
 He also remembered when the harbour   
 was used as a smuggling base.
