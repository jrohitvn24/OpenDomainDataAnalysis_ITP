		<title>13TRANSPORT IN THE DERG.</title>
		<content> Transport and communications in       
 Castlederg in comparison with the rest
 of the province is poor.  Week days   
 have Ulsterbus links Omagh and        
 Strabane: There are however no bus    
 links after 1800 hrs either to or from
 other towns. Weekends see a limited   
 service on Saturday mornings.  There  
 are no direct links from the town by  
 bus to any destination to Fermanagh or
 Donegal. The car is the only certain  
 means of transport. Because of this   
 the majority of young people learn to 
 drive at an early age, so when they   
 become 17 their main priority is a    
 driving licence.  This gives them     
 mobility out of their rural areas to  
 the more modern towns - mainly for    
 socialising.  People in this rural    
 area have adapted very well to the    
 lack of public transport.   A simple  
 push and pull example.                </content>
