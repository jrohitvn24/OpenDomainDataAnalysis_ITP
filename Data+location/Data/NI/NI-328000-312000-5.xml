		<content> INCLUDING THE SKIPPER AND A DIVER.    
 THE SKIPPER IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST     
 IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THE CREW AS HE    
 DECIDES WHERE AND WHEN TO FISH.       
 HAVING A DIVER ON BOARD IS VERY USEFUL
 AS HE CAN REPAIR ANY DAMAGE UNDER     
 WATER, SUCH AS THE NET GETTING CAUGHT 
 IN THE PROPELLER.  WHEN YOU CONSIDER  
 THAT A PURSE SEINE NET USED BY THESE  
 BOATS COSTS UP TO Â£100,000 HIS WORK IS
 OBVIOUSLY VITAL.                      
 IN THE HARBOUR FACTORIES BOTH THE     
 PRAWNS AND FISH ARE PROCESSED.  THE   
 PRAWNS ARE GUTTED, SHELLED, FROZEN,   
 BATTERED AND FINALLY BAGGED.  FISH ARE
 GUTTED, SALTED AND THEN FROZEN, READY 
 FOR EXPORT TO THE MAINLAND, NIGERIA   
 AND EASTERN BLACK COUNTRIES.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
