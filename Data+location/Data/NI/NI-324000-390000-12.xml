 Gowdy's is situated in Cogry  mill  in
 the area of{Kilbride.                 
    They  moved  to  Cogry mill in 1980
 and make gears for the  famous {Shorts
 aeroplanes , manufacture   heavy  duty
 shredding    machines    and    are  a
 computerised  firm .  They  employ  30
 people to operate the factory.        
                                       
    The building , before  Gowdy's took
 over was  a  linen  factory  producing
 cloth. Then man made  fibre  took over
 and the factory was closed down.      
                                       
   The  introduction  of  the plans for
 Shorts new plane  means  that {Gowdy's
  will have to  make  the gears for the
 engines.This is an important{industry 
 in this area.
