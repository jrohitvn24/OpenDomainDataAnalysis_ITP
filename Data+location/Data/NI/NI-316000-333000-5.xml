		<title>05CROP FARMING IN RATHFRILAND</title>
		<content>    ARABLE FARMING AROUND RATHFRILAND  
 CONSISTS MAINLY OF SILAGE,HAY AND     
 POTATOES. THE POTATOES ARE PLANTED    
 AROUND EASTER AND GATHERED IN LATE    
 SUMMER. WHEN THE POTATOES ARE GATHERED
 THE FIELDS ARE RESEEDED FOR GRASS.    
   SILAGE IS CUT IN JUNE AND THEN AGAIN
 IN SEPTEMBER. THE GRASS IS STORED IN  
 SILOS DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. THE   
 SILOS ARE OPENED AND THE COWS FEED ON 
 THE SILAGE.                           
   HAY IS USUALLY CUT IN EARLY JUNE AND
 LEFT TO DRY IN THE SUMMER SUNSHINE.   
 ABOUT A WEEK LATER THE DRIED GRASS IS 
 TURNED AND PUT THROUGH A MACHINE WHICH
 BALES IT. THIS IS STORED UNTIL THE    
 WINTER TIME AND USED TO FEED THE      
 ANIMALS WHEN GRASS IS IN SHORT SUPPLY.
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
