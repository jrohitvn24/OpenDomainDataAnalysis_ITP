		<title>01DUNDONALD:A GENERAL VIEW</title>
		<content> Thousands of years before Christ      
 primitive farmers lived in this area  
 and have left their mark in the form  
 of{Megaliths}and{Dolmens.}The Normans 
 conquered County Down in 1177 and     
 established the{"The Manor of         
{Dundonald"}with its motte and wooden  
 castle. King John visited Dundonald in
 1210 and the following year money was 
 granted for building and improvements 
 in the area. In 1605 a Scot,James     
 Hamilton,acquired the district and    
 established a clachan around the      
 Green.The twentieth century saw       
 expansion with particular rapidity in 
 the 1960's when housing estates were  
 built to accommodate the rising       
 population and the shift from Belfast.
 It is now a suburb of Belfast under   
 Castlereagh Borough District Council. 
 The area is predominately residential 
 but surrounded by farmland.           </content>
