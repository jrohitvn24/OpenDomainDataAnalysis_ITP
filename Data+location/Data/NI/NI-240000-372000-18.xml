 We go there regularly and we find the 
 sport very enjoyable.                 
                                       
 Another very popular place in our     
 block for both young and old is the   
 cinema which is located on the        
 Drumquin Road. The cinema is a modern 
 twin-studio and offers all the up to  
 date films often with late showings at
 the weekend.                          
                                       
 The Town Hall, which is outside our   
 block, provides entertainment for many
 of our residents. In the hall plays   
 are often produced,the local feis is  
 held, bingo and various other         
 activities take place here.           
                                       
 For anyone interested in eating out   
 Omagh provides a wide variety of      
 eating places.                        </content>
