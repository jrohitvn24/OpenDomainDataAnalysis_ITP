 CHURCH IN ARDGLASS.THE PEOPLE HAD TO  
 GO TO BALLEE.THE PRESBYTERIANS HAD A  
 ROW AMONG THEMSELVES AND SOME OF THEM 
 DEPARTED FROM THE CHURCH AND HAD TO   
 WALK TO CROSSGAR TO GO TO CHURCH.THE  
 PRESBYTERIANS WHO LEFT THE CHURCH AT  
 BALLEE BOUGHT SOME LAND FROM THE DUKE 
 TO BUILD A CHURCH.THEY BUILT A NEW    
 BARN TYPE.THE WINDOWS USED TO BE PLAIN
 BUT NOW THEY HAVE STAINED GLASS       
 PICTURES OF THE LAND ON ONE SIDE AND  
 THE OTHER SIDE HAS PICTURES OF THE    
 SEA.THE CHURCH HAS A FACINATING VIEW  
 OF THE HARBOUR FROM THE BACK.THERE    
 WERE ABOUT 70 FAMILIES THEN BUT NOW   
 THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 50.THE COLLECTION
 PLATE USED TO BE ON A LONG STICK.THE  
 AISLE DOWN THE CENTRE OF THE CHURCH   
 HAS BEEN CHANGED INTO TWO SMALL AISLES
 GOING DOWN THE SIDES.
