		<title>20AIR/ROAD TRAVEL NEWTOWNARDS</title>
		<content> The main form of transport is road    
 transport. There is no railway station
 as the railway closed in l950. Dual   
 carriageways link the town to Belfast,
 Bangor and Comber. Traffic passes     
 through the town centre which can be  
 very busy at certain times of the day.
 Bus services link the town to         
 surrounding towns and villages and to 
 Belfast. Some of the services go to   
 and from Newtownards, others are      
 through services to and from Belfast  
 and the surrounding towns and         
 villages. The town has an airport on  
 the Portaferry Road. First opened in  
 l930 it has two concrete runways and  
 is owned and operated by the Ulster   
 Flying Club. The club provides flying 
 lessons and also acts as a base for   
 executive aircraft which fly business 
 men to different parts of Ireland,    
 Britain and Europe.                   </content>
