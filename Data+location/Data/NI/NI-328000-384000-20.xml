		<content> But Mrs. Corr died and the young      
 couple bought a pub on the opposite   
 side of the road to the present       
 premises.Hence the name Corrs Corner. 
   Whitleys was first started under    
 that name by the present owners       
 great,great,great,grandfather Wm.     
 Whitley as a spirit grocer in 1825. He
 had been in business in Knowehead.    
   There is a painting in the bar      
 showing what the inn was like in c1900
 You can still recognise which part of 
 the present premises is the original  
 building. Inside you can see the old  
 doorway, floor and ceiling of the     
 first little grocers shop. There is a 
 big black kitchen range with an oven, 
 a boiler with brass tap and crooks on 
 which to hang pots. In the whole area 
 people treasure things of the past yet
 appreciate the best that the modern   
 world offers.                         </content>
