		<content> Glastry High School - "Community      
 School".                              
 Amenities, sports facilities and      
 entertainment are in short supply in  
 the southern part of the Ards         
 Peninsula. The S.E.E.L.B. decided to  
 make available to the public,         
 facilities existing in schools. Two   
 years ago a teacher was appointed to  
 the staff of Glastry High School, with
 particular responsibility to organize 
 evening classes. These have been quite
 successful and should continue to     
 thrive. Classes already operating     
 include: Art &amp; Crafts, Metalwork,     
 Woodwork, Typing, Computer Studies,   
 "Keep Fit" &amp; Soccer training.         
 New ventures have included Guitar     
 Tuition, Dancing lessons, Skiing      
 lessons in Craigavon &amp; Sea Cadets.    
 Youth Club: snooker, badminton etc.
