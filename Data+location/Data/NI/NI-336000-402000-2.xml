		<title>02LARNE - HOMES AND INDUSTRY</title>
		<content>  The{Craigy Hill}Housing Estate shows 
 the typical street  pattern of Sixties
 housing. Directly south is another new
 development,{Antiville.}The population
 is  now  concentrated in these estates
 with fewer people living in the centre
 of the old town.                      
{Industry}is spread throughout the area
 and it was the growth of  factories in
 Larne which produced  the expansion of
 housing. This development was possible
 because of the facilities of the large
{port of  Larne}and the  excellent link
 to Belfast and the airport by the{dual
{carriageway} cutting across this zone.
 Within recent years  industry has seen
 a recession but a  growth  of  service
 industries  and  new  recreational and
 social development. Most of the pupils
 in our school live in these estates.
