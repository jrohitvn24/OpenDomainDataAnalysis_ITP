 rebellion.It was rebuilt in           
{Enniskillen}to the east of the church 
 in{1643.

 site in 1777;it had accommodation for 
 90 Boarders as well as the local

 colonnades were added in 1838,and the 
 space between them and the main block 
 was filled in 1859.{Reverend William  
{Steele}became Headmaster in 1857 and  
 he added the Steele Hall to the       
 school,largely at his own expense.    
   New buildings have been added in
