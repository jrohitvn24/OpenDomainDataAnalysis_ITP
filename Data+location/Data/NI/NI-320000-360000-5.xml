		<content>{Prison Breakout.}The Maze Prison      
 covering approximately 1 square       
 kilometre was built in the early 70's.
 The surrounding area became the centre
 of world attention on Sunday the 25th 
 of September 1983.                    
 Thirty eight I.R.A. prisoners forced  
 their way out of the Maze Prison      
 leaving one prison officer dead and   
 others injured.They ran through a     
 group of terrified children returning 
 from Culcavey Sunday School and made  
 their way into Bog Road,hijacking     
 local cars as means of transport.Many 
 of the residents caught only fleeting 
 glimpses of the prisoners as they made
 good their escape.The most intensive  
 man hunt ever seen in Northern Ireland
 began and for twenty four hours no-one
 was allowed in or out of the immediate
 area.Nineteen prisoners completed     
 their escape and are still at large.  </content>
