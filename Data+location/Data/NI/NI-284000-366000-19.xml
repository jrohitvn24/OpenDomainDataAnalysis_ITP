		<title>19UPDATE/ COALISLAND.</title>
		<content> Since we first started work on the{   
{Domesday Project}in May/June 1985 a   
 number of significant changes have    
 taken place within the {Coalisland}   
 area. In the town{The Sportsman public
{house}has been demolished to make way 
 for a much larger licensed premises   
 comprising restaurant,function rooms  
 and two shop units. On{Lineside}a     
 private house has been converted to an
 estate agents with a shop above and   
 the {Cinema}has closed down.  In the  
 Clonoe area plans for a new R.C.      
 church costing Â£1/2m have been        
 finalised. The present church which   
 dates back to the 1770's is too small.
 The oldest church in the area is also 
 situated in Clonoe.  St. Michael's C  
 of I. dates back to the 15th          
 century  and until recently provided  
 burial for the parishioners of the    
 Roman Catholic Church.                </content>
