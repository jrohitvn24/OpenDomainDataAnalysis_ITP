		<title>03St.Brigid's Cross</title>
		<content>   Lots of people have St.Brigid's     
 crosses in their homes to remind them 
 of St.Brigid. St.Brigid lived in      
 Ireland long ago.                     
   It is fairly simple to make a       
 St.Brigid's cross. First go to the    
 nearest field and collect about thirty
 or forty rushes. Trim them till they  
 are about twelve inches long. Then    
 take two rushes and fold one across   
 the centre of the other. Hold the two 
 ends of the folded one together. Take 
 another one and fold it so that the   
 two ends stick out to the right and   
 slide them up to the top of the other 
 folded one. Keep repeating this until 
 you have the cross shape made. Then   
 sellotape each of the ends so that the
 rushes all don't come apart again.    
 People have been making St. Brigid's  
 crosses for hundreds of years.
