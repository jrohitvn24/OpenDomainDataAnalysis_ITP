		<title>03MAY DAY AND THE MAYPOLE/1</title>
		<content> In the centre of Holywood stands one  
 of the last Maypoles in existence.  It
 is used to celebrate the coming of    
 summer on the 1st May.  This          
 celebration takes place around the    
 Maypole, for instance Scottich        
 Dancing, Irish Dancing and sometimes  
 Disco-dancing.                        
                                       
 How the Maypole ever got situated in  
 Holywood is unknown, but there is a   
 traditional story behind it.  A       
 Dutchman, in the early 1700's and his 
 crew were said to have been           
 shipwrecked.  They put the main-mast  
 of their ship at the intersection of  
 the town's two streets, decorated it  
 with flowers and partnered the women  
 of the town for dancing.  But nowadays
 instead of flowers decorating the     
 Maypole, they have little ships.
