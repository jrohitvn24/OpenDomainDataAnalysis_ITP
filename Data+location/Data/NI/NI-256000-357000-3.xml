		<title>03ERRIGAL KERROGUE CROSS.</title>
		<content> Errigal Kerrogue Cross stands in the  
 graveyard surrounding the ruins of an 
 old church in the townland of Errigal.
  The cross carved from stone may have 
 been ornamented but being greatly     
 exposed to the weather this would have
 been eroded over the years.           
  The site has in recent years been    
 cared for by the Department of        
 Environment who have provided concrete
 paths and trim the grass regularly.   
  A story associated with the old      
 church ruins is worth recording. A man
 of surmame Mc Mahon will be killed by 
 the remaining gable wall falling on   
 him. Legend says that at the original 
 building of the monastry on the site  
 an ox was used to transport the       
 stones. As food for the work-force was
 scarce St Kieran told his men that    
 each evening they could kill the ox   
 and eat the flesh.                    </content>
