		<content> There are 4 schools in our area.      
 The 2{secondary schools}are Ardnaveigh
 and St.Malachys.Both are              
 co-educational catering for 11 to 16  
 year olds.St.Malachys caters only for 
 Roman Catholic children because their 
 Church in Ireland insists on them     
 having separate education for         
 politico-religious reasons.Ardnaveigh 
 is thereby mainly Protestant but is a 
 state school for all classes and      
 creeds.The basic menu of Art and      
 Science subjects is served in both    
 schools.                              
 Ardnaveigh is designated as a{        
{Community School}and so offers a wide 
 range of adult and evening classes.It 
 also provides language facilities for 
 foreigners in the area.               
 Rathmore and Rathenraw are the 2{     
{primary schools}.Selection is still   
 practised at the age of 11.           </content>
