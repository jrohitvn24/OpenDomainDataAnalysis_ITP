		<title>09THE HOUSING EXECUTIVE</title>
		<content> The N.I.H.E. took over control of     
 housing in 1970/71 to provide a better
 balance in the allocation of housing  
 to both communities.The approximate   
 number of houses provided since that  
 time is 700.The average rent of a     
 three-bedroomed house is $24-00.There 
 are many complaints about the amount  
 of rent to be paid and the cost of the
 smokeless fuel which is burnt in the  
 newer houses.Many tenants,however,are 
 on supplementary benefit or the "dole"
 and are receiving assistance with     
 payments.Some tenants have opted to   
 buy their houses.
