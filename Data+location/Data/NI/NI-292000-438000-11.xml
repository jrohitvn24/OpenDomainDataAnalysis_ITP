		<title>11 The Health Clinic</title>
		<content> The Health Clinic is in Bushmills.  It
is run by Moyle District Council.  Some
of the jobs at the clinic are district 
nurses, a speech therapist, a doctor   
who attends twice a month, a social    
worker and someone to run the toy      
library.  This is done voluntarily.    
There is no special job for a          
receptionist.                          
                                       
 The  {infant welfare} takes place     
about once a week usually on a         
Wednesday and about 25 attend it.  For 
the first six months of a baby's life  
it attends the clinic every 2 weeks.   
Then it goes for different reasons,    
for example, speech therapy.  On       
average about 5 people attend {speech  
therapy} per day.  The {toy library}   
is for children under school age.      
About 10  children come with their     
parents.  The Health Centre itself     </content>
