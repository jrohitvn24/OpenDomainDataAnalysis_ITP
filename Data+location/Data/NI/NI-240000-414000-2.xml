		<title>02THE RIVER WALK</title>
		<content>{On the east bank of the River Foyle is
{a walk. This used to be the Co.Donegal
{Railway which closed in 1960. People  
{go for walks along the old railway as 
{far as Prehen Boat Club. On the west  
{bank of the river there was another   
{old railway. This was the G.N.R.which 
{closed in 1968.You could get a train  
{to Omagh,Dungannon and Dublin. There  
{are plans to rebuild part of the old  
{railway line. This will give jobs to  
{some unemployed men. When the rebuilt 
{railway is opened,this should bring   
{more tourists to the city of          
{Londonderry. }
