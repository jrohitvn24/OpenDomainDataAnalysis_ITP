		<title>18FARMING</title>
		<content>   All farmers felt that the main      
 changes in farming had occurred over  
 the past 100 years and that changes in
 the future would deal more with       
 limiting over_production and          
 diversifying produce.                 
   Cows were milked twice daily and    
 milk was collected daily by local     
 dairy farms and used for fresh milk   
 and dairy products, in the wider      
 Belfast area.                         
   Several older farmers let their land
 to neighbouring farms. No land was    
 unworked.                             
   In the rural area more newer        
 dwellings are being built as farmers  
 are selling small sites for individual
 houses.                               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
