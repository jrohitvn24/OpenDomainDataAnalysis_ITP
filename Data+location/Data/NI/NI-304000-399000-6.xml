		<content> In this rural area farming still      
 provides a lot of employment. However,
 as most are family owned farms it is  
 mainly{self-employment.               
 While the growing village of Ahogill  
 provides work in the{shops,and local  
{services e.g. in schools,health centre
{and library,}most employment is in    
 Ballymena 4 miles away.               
  The nearest large factory is at      
 Galgorm 100metres from Gracehill      
 village,where{Galaghers}make tobacco  
 products; cigarettes and cigars.This  
 has been a large employer of both men 
 and women,but due to health scares    
 sales have fallen with lost jobs.     
  Near Ahoghill are two smaller firms  
 which employ many locals.{Ahoghill    
{Joinery Works}makes windows,doors     
 e.t.c.,for local builders,while {     
{Lovell and Christmas}prepare and      
 distribute meat products.             </content>
