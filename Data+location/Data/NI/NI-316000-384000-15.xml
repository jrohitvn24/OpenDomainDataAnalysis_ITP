		<content> There are no centres for entertainment
 in the block but the Muckamore Choral 
 and Light Entertainment Society       
 provides entertainment during the     
 Christmas and Summer Holidays.        
 The Society was founded in September  
 l979.  The founders thought that by   
 producing pantomime the Community     
 could be brought closer together.  A  
 script was written, songs and dances  
 rehearsed and with a cast of l4 adults
 and 34 children Alladin was the first 
 production in December l979.  This    
 proved so successful that it was      
 decided to put on a summer variety    
 show as part of Antrim Civic Week and 
 and Festival in June l980. The Company
 performs in Muckamore Community Centre
 and has continued to produce          
 pantomimes and summer shows since     
 then.
