 comfortable and the majority well     
 maintained clean and tidy.Many have   
 large flower and vegetable gardens    
 which need much attention.Repairs and 
 decorations and painting outside are  
 done every year at Spring Cleaning    
 Time.A site costs around{Â£6000}and the
 cost for a new bungalow is            
 approximately {Â£30,000,}but before any
 buildings big or small can be erected 
 planning permission must be given by  
 the Planning Department of the        
 Department of the Envoirnment.There   
 are{restrictions}on building in       
 certain areas, and to obtain a        
 government grant,the house must be    
 built according to their rules.For    
 building everybody has to borrow money
 from a{Bank or a Building Society}and
