		<title>01LANDSCAPE OF COOKSTOWN</title>
		<content>   Cookstown is a market town situated 
 in East Tyrone .It is a rich farming  
 area adjacent to the Ballinderry      
 river. Soil types are rich mediumto   
 heavy loams.  Underlying rocks are    
 mostly limestone and sandstone.       
 Rainfall is around one hundred        
 centimetres annually. The rich soils  
 and the considerable rainfall combine 
 to make this an excellent grass       
 producing area. This is reflected in  
 the main farming activites which are  
 grass based. Farms are therefore      
 mainly dairy and beef cattle. Some    
 sheep are found on the higher ground. 
 Pig farming is also important and this
 arose initially as a means of         
 utrilizing skimmed milk.   The main   
 industries reflect the farming types. 
 The creamerie at Dunman Bridge handle 
 the milk. The Unipork Factory the     
 pigs.                                 </content>
