		<content> A new G.A.A.pitch is at present under 
 development outside the village on the
 Tullynavall Road.The football club    
 bought the land, comprising  7 acres, 
 from a local farmer for Â£15,500.The   
 land was drained and earth moving     
 equipment made the area level.The top 
 soil was replaced and it was sown out 
 in grass again,and a perimiter fence  
 of wire was erected.The pitch now     
 measures 147m by 90m.There is         
 provision for dug outs and a large car
 park to the left of the entrance.The  
 pitch is scheduled to open in the     
 summer of 1986 and the building of a  
 club house and changing rooms is      
 planned for the following year.The    
 Gaelic Athletic Association hold a    
 "Scor" competition each year and      
 members have won through to the County
 Final.The Irish Language Class has a  
 special Mass on St. Patrick's Day.    </content>
