 ENGINED FISHING BOATS,INSTEAD THERE   
 WERE SAILS.FISHING VESSELS WERE CALLED
 NICKIES AND NOBBIES.IN SCOTLAND THERE 
 WAS THE FIFIE AND THE ZULU.LATER THE  
 STEAM DRIFTER APPEARED,IT WAS USED A  
 LOT BEFORE 1945.THE MAIN CATCH WAS    
 HERRING ALL OVER THE BRITISH ISLES.THE
 HERRING WERE EXPORTED TO THE BALTIC   
 AND RUSSIAN PORTS.THEY WERE TAKEN IN  
 STEAM SHIPS IN CARGOES OF UP TO 1500  
 BARRELS.THE BOATS HELD A CREW OF FIVE 
 BUT ON BIG STEAM SHIPS THERE WOULD BE 
 A CREW OF TEN.THEY WERE GUTTED BY     
 FISHER LASSIES WHO PACKED THEM IN     
 BARRELS ASWELL.THEY GOT TEN PENCE FOR 
 EACH BARREL PACKED FULL WITH FISH.    
 THREE FISHER LASSIES COULD FILL 30    
 BARRELS EACH HOLDING 600 FISH DAILY.  
 THE HERRING WERE GRADED AND LATE IN   
 THE SEASON CALLED SPENTS.
