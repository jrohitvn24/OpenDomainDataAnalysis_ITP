		<content> The picturesque beauty of the area has
 attracted in recent years, a lot of   
 private development.  Unlike rural    
 Ireland in general, there are very few
 old farmhouses since the land is not  
 suitable for farming.  The only public
 authority housing in the entire area  
 is Maginnis Villas which are situated 
 on the Greenan side of the Canal.     
                                       
 One house in particular stands out as 
 it contravenes the planning laws.  It 
 is incongruous with the scenic beauty 
 of the area as it has been built with 
 red brick.  There are quite a few     
 derelict houses in the area which are 
 likely to be purchased in the near    
 future as sites, due to the boom in   
 local development.
