		<content> On Friday 10th May, 1985 a group of   
 nine girls went to Holywood to        
 interview Canon Barber, who is the    
 vicar of the Parish Church of         
 St.Philip and St.James.  It was first 
 built in 1843 when it had a           
 congregation of 600 families.  In the 
 next 25 years it was extended because 
 of the rise in population due to the  
 growth of the linen industry.  The    
 church now holds 1,200 families and,  
 over the past 40 years, there have    
 been many additions to the original   
 building.                             
                                       
 Canon Barber took us up to the altar  
 where we asked him some questions.  He
 told us that he had lived in Holywood 
 for 40 years and that he had been a   
 vicar for nearly as long as he had    
 lived in Holywood.  Since he has lived
 there he has noticed many changes.    </content>
