     On the 30th of May 1985 my group  
 went to{Devenish Wood Products.}This  
 firm came to Irvinestown in 1974.     
 They make chairs, window frames,      
 kitchens, doors and bar furniture.    
     There are three people employed   
 at the moment. There are no plans for 
 expansion in the business at present. 
 They have plenty of wood. While I was 
 there the men were cutting wood into  
 shapes and polishing it and putting it
 together.                             
     They had about ten different      
 machines and they have a room for     
 spraying and painting the wood. They  
 showed us one completed bar seat and  
 they were in the process of making    
 many more.
