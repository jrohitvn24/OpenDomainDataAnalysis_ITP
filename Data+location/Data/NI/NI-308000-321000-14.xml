		<title>14FATHOM/GREENAN:LOCAL CUSTOMS</title>
		<content> Every year around Halloween time      
 children from this area set about     
 collecting branches and old tyres to  
 make a bonfire.  In the Fathom area   
 the bonfire is situated on the spot   
 where a local man committed suicide.  
 After several days of preparation the 
 bonfire is built and on Halloween     
 night the local people, young and old,
 gather around to light the bonfire.   
 The ghost of the local man is said to 
 appear on this night.  There is also  
 the local custom in the Fathom area of
 making cures.  One of these cures is  
 for rheumatic pains and is made of    
 honey and lemon.  In the Greenan area 
 there lives a man who is known as "The
 Fortune Teller".  Local people from   
 the area come to him and he predicts  
 their future by the use of tea leaves.
