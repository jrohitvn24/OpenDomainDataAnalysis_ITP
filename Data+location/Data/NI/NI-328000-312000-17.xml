		<content> SECOND KILKEEL BOYS BRIGADE USE THE   
 CHURCH HALL ON MONDAYS AND THURSDAYS. 
 THERE IS A THIRD COMPANY IN THE TOWN, 
 CONNECTED TO KILKEEL PRESBYTERIAN     
 CHURCH, BUT THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE NOT  
 LIMITED TO USING THE CHURCH HALLS.    
 THERE ARE MANY COMPETITIONS THROUGHOUT
 CO. DOWN AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES AT    
 MOURNE PARK WHICH IS SITUATED 3 MILES 
 FROM KILKEEL. HERE THE BOYS CAN TAKE  
 PART IN CAMPING, CANOING, ORIENTEERING
 AND HILL WALKING.  UNFORTUNATELY THE  
 CLOSEST SWIMMING POOL IS 20 MILES     
 AWAY, BUT MOST YOUTH GROUPS DO        
 OCCASIONALLY MAKE THIS JOURNEY.       
 GIRL GUIDES AND BROWNIES USE THE      
 PARISH HALL ON WEDNESDAY EVENINGS,    
 INVOLVING ABOUT 40 GIRLS.  THERE IS   
 ALSO A COMPANY ATTACHED TO ST.        
 COLMAN'S ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.  MUCH 
 OF THEIR TIME DURING THE WINTER IS    
 SPENT DOING BADGEWORK.                </content>
