		<title>20BELFAST'S LEISURE CENTRE.</title>
		<content>   If you live in South or West        
 Belfast, and want to swim, play indoor
 or outdoor games, join a craft class  
 or take your child to a playgroup,    
 then the place to go is the Olympia   
 Leisure Centre. It is on the Boucher  
 Road, built on part of the Bog Meadows
 and was opened in 1983. Indoors there 
 is a main hall for sport, concerts    
 etc., a large swimming pool, a social 
 area and a snack bar, a craft room and
 an exercise room as well as the       
 playcentre for young children.        
 Outdoors there is a floodlit all      
 weather sports pitch and a running    
 track. Many local schools and youth   
 organisations use the centre and many 
 children spend much of their summer   
 holiday taking part in the special    
 summer scheme activities.
