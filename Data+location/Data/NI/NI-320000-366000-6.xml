		<content>{RECREATION.}There are few facilities  
 in the area,except for the church     
 halls where Boys and Girls Brigade    
 and church society meetings are held. 
 On the Glenavy Road there is an Orange
 Hall and a Temperance Hall. There is  
 also a snooker hall near the White Mt.
 quarries and the area around the old  
 lime kilns on Moneybroom Rd. is used  
 for clay-pigeon shooting. For most    
 recreational and sporting activities, 
 however,residents travel outside the  
 area.                                 
{TRANSPORT} Most people in the area    
 travel by private car. The only public
 transport is a bus service from       
 Lisburn to Crumlin along the Glenavy  
 Road, which runs right through D-Block
 and a service from Lisburn to Crumlin 
 on the Ballinderry Road which enters  
 the extreme S.W. corner of the block.
