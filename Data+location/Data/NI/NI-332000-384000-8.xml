		<content> APROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF THE AREA IS 
 OF FAIRLY HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL    
 LAND USE.                             
 THIS PART OF THE AREA DEVELOPED       
 AROUND MILL VILLAGES WHICH WERE       
 ESTABLISED BY THE MID 19TH CENTURY.   
 MOSSLEY AND MONKSTOWN WERE BOTH MILL  
 VILLAGES.                             
                              MUCH OF  
 OLD MONKSTOWN WAS KNOCKED DOWN IN THE 
 EARLY 1960'S FOR NEW HOUSING          
 DEVELOPMENT BUT THE TERRACED MILL     
 HOUSES ARE STILL STANDING IN MOSSLEY. 
    THE MODERN HOUSING ESTATES HAVE    
 BEEN DEVELOPED SINCE THE EARLY 1960'S.
                                       
                                       
    WITHIN THE AREA THERE ARE ALSO     
 SEVERAL SMALL SHOPPING CENTRES SELLING
 MAINLY LOW ORDER CONVENIENCE GOODS    
 .                                     
                                       </content>
