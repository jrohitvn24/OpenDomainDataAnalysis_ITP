		<title>05A DAY IN THE LIFE</title>
		<content> I get up in the morning at 8 o'clock  
 and put on my uniform. Then I go      
 downstairs for my breakfast of coffee 
 and toast. As I must be in school for 
 8:55 and school is a 5_10 minute walk,
 I leave at 8:45. In school there is a 
 certain timetable for each day.       
                                       
 There are 7 classes a day which last  
 45 minutes each except for the the    
 last class which is 40 minutes. We    
 have a breaktime of 20 minutes and a  
 dinner break of 50 minutes. School    
 ends at 3:25 and I go home and change 
 into my ordinary clothes. I leave the 
 house and walk to my granny's at the  
 Quay where most of my friends live.My 
 friends and I usually go to an        
 amusement arcade where we play video  
 games. At the weekends and during the 
 summer holidays I stay at my granny's 
 house.                                </content>
