 The area is immediately to the west of
 Hillsborough and includes a           
 residential part of the village. The  
 land use is essentially for the       
 grazing and winter feeding through    
 silage of milk cattle. Some sheep and 
 beef cattle are reared. Amenities     
 related to farming are the preparation
 of grassland fertilizer and the sale  
 of tractors and other farm equipment. 
 Recreational amenities include a rifle
 range and a snooker club both of which
 serve the village and local community.
 Two small primary schools controlled  
 by the local education authority serve
 the rural area. In total 150 children 
 attend these.  The churches, Church of
 Ireland, both adjacent to the schools 
 are under the authority of one        
 minister. There is a small Roman      
                                       </content>
