		<title>07FARMING IN THE GLEN</title>
		<content>{Today farming}in the mountains and    
 hills is{very difficult.}The farmer   
 has to feed the sheep on treacle      
 and nuts for the{winter months}from   
{January to May.}The lambing starts    
 about 8th April and ends about        
 mid_may. After the lambing the        
 lambs have to be kept healthy         
 until they can eat grass.  Pet        
 lambs are a nusiance and we try to    
 have as few as possible.  Sheep       
 have a lot of{diseases}but            
{penicillen}cures the most of them.    
 After the lambs are cared for the     
{clipping comes.}It is long and tiring 
 job. Every sheep has to be clipped .  
 Then comes the{dipping.}All the sheep 
 are put into a big pen, put into the  
 dipper one by one and plunged two or  
 three times. In Autumn{lambs are sold 
{.Some}go to the grader.All the nice   
 lambs go to the local sales.          </content>
