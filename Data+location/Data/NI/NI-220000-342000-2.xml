		<title>02BORN BETWEEN THE BRIDGES</title>
		<content>     The title indicates one of the    
 attitudes of the old people who live  
 in Enniskillen.To them anyone not born
 between the bridges,the East and West 
 bridge,was not a true native of       
 Enniskillen.However today with most   
 births taking place in the hospital,  
 which is built off the island, there  
 are no true "Enniskilleners".The      
 situation is not helped by the fact   
 that since 1950 most new building that
 has taken place  on the island has    
 been for commercial, rather than      
 residential, function.Since 1947 the  
 population of the island has decreased
 from 2722 to 286 (in 1978),while the  
 population of the town has grown from 
 5000 to 10,500.Car parks,in particular
 are now to be found in sites formerly 
 occupied by houses,and this is        
 somethings which local people have    
 objected to unsuccessfully.           </content>
