		<content> Ballygawley is a little village in Co.
 Tyrone.It is situated between Omagh   
 and Dungannon at the head of the very 
 fertile Clogher Valley.There are      
 around five hundred and fifty         
 people living in Ballygawley.It is in 
 the middle of Ulster and is often     
 called the Crossroads of Ulster.It is 
 about sixty miles to the seaside,that 
 is to either Portrush, Donegal or     
 Newcastle. It is the crossing point   
 for travellers going from Belfast to  
 the west and from Derry to Dublin.It  
 is surrounded by very good fertile    
 land except to the north where the    
 land rises to become hilly and less   
 fertile.A small river,called the      
 Ballygawley River,which flows through 
 the village is a tributary of the     
 River Blackwater which in turn flows  
 into Lough Neagh.
