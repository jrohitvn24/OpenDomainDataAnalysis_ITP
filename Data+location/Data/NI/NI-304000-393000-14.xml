		<content> Most houses along the Ahoghill Road   
 have some land with the site.         
 Some of the owners have converted the 
 land into large gardens with sloping  
 lawns and large flower beds, while    
 others, like the occupants of no.148  
 keep calves,sheep and goats on their  
 two acres of land.                    
 Two houses nearby are up for sale.    
 Both are detached with a garage,three 
 bedrooms,sitting room,kitchen and     
 bathroom. The smaller of the two is   
 situated on a quarter acre of land and
 is priced at Â£30,000 approx. The other
 is on half an acre, costing around    
 Â£42,500.      {*}Slide C{*            
 Several new modern houses are also    
 being built on the Portglenone and    
 Coolsythe Roads.                      
 Elsewhere however a small number of   
 tiny stone cottages are still without 
 electricity.                          </content>
