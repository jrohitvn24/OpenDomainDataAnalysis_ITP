 ONE LARGE GYM AND A SPORTS HALL,WHERE 
 WE PLAY NETBALL,HOCKEY,BADMINTON,

 LOVELY THINGS THERE.                  
   THE ASSEMBLY HALL IS LARGE,WE       
 HAVE ASSEMBLY THERE EVERY MORNING AND 
 IT IS USED FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS,LIKE 
 PRIZE DAY AND SCHOOL PLAYS.THERE ARE 3
 ART ROOMS,WHERE WE DRAW,PAINT AND DO  
 POTTERY AND ALSO VARIOUS OTHER ART    
 WORK.

 SCHOOL BETWEEN THE AGES OF 11 AND     
 18.THE UNIFORM IS DARK BLUE AND CAN BE
 WORN WITH FAWN OR WHITE BLOUSES.FOR
