		<content>   DAIRY FARMING IS THE MOST COMMON    
 TYPE OF FARMING IN THE RATHFRILAND    
 AREA. THE NUMBER OF COWS ON A DAIRY   
 FARM CAN VARY FROM 30 TO 150.DAIRY    
 FARMING IS A VERY DEMANDING JOB AS THE
 COWS HAVE TO BE MILKED TWICE EACH DAY.
   AT 7a.m. THE COWS ARE BROUGHT INTO  
 THE MILKING PARLOUR AND MILKED. IT    
 USUALLY TAKES 2 HOURS TO MILK THE     
 COWS. WHEN THEY ARE MILKED THEY ARE   
 RETURNED TO THE FIELD. AGAIN AT 5p.m. 
 THE COWS ARE BROUGHT BACK INTO THE    
 PARLOUR AND MILKED AGAIN.             
   DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS THE COWS   
 ARE FED ON GRASS. IN THE WINTER THE   
 COWS ARE FED ON SILAGE.
