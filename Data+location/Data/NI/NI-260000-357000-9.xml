 the parish of Errigal Ciaran.Its      
 grounds are in Dunmoyle where there is
 a fine pitch,stand and dressing rooms.
 It is called Cardinal Mc Rory Park.The
 club has under 12,under 14,under 16,  
 under 18 and two adult teams.The adult
 teams now play in division two of the 
 Tyrone County League.The club also    
 promotes the game of camogie which is 
 played by girls.Many people from our  
 area and from our school play for some
 of the club's teams.Many other people 
 from the area travel with the teams to
 support them.Nearly all matches are   
 played on Sunday afternoons.
