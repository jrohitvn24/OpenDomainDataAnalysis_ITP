		<title>16Farm machinery</title>
		<content>  Much of our area is used for farming 
 and 'tilling the soil' has been a     
 familiar sight for many               
 generations.Over the years there has  
 been a revolution in farm             
 machinery.The old thrashing machines  
 were used to separate the ears from   
 the straw.In an outhouse of the farm a
 large barrel was suspended off the    
 floor and joined to the wall by a     
 pipe.A series of pipes and cogwheels  
 was turned by a horse walking in a    
 continuous circle.The turning of the  
 pipe rotated the barrel and the       
 rocking motion separated the grain    
 from the chaff.In the past a reaper   
 was used to cut the corn and a binder 
 for tying the bundles together.Today  
 all these jobs are completed in one   
 operation by the combine harvester.
