		<title>14THE FUTURE</title>
		<content>{SPORT                                 
 The sport of the future will have lots
 of new ideas and you will be playing  
 them all the time. The first and most 
 popular sport will be robo-ball.      
 Unlike our time you will not be       
 playing yourselves but controlling    
 robots to play for you.As soon        
 as the game starts you control them.  
 You have to program them  before the  
 game starts. It takes over from our   
 game of football.                     
{FOOD                                  
 Our last section of this prophecy is  
 about food.It is a hard question to   
 ask as I think food will be the same  
 but probably you will recieve it      
 differently. There will be a          
 jet-powered knife, fork and spoon.    
 These are our prophecies in 1985.We   
 hope that they will be fulfilled.
