		<title>15TOURISM DONAGHADEE</title>
		<content> Although Donaghadee is a small town it
 is quite popular with tourists who    
 find the town interesting and         
 invigorating. The piers of the old    
 harbour are a favourite stroll for    
 hundreds of visitors who enjoy the    
 views of the North Channel, the       
 Lighthouses and the many small boats  
 moored in the harbour and Marina.     
 In the area are some caravan sites    
 which bring many summer residents.    
                                       
 Motor boats take amateur fishermen out
 Deep Sea Fishing every day during the 
 summer months. These boats also take  
 parties to the nearby {Copeland       
{Islands.}These no-longer inhabited    
 islands with their empty cottages,    
 seals, sea birds and air of solitude  
 have a strange attraction for a       
 number of visitors.
