		<content> Up until 1858 the village was known as
{Muff.}In 1613, during the reign of {  
{James 1,}the Irish Society was formed 
 and the lands of Muff were granted to 
 the{Grocers' Company.}The company     
 erected a castle and established Muff 
 in 1619. It also funded the building  
 of a church in 1626, the gable of     
 which still stands today. The present 
 rectory was built in 1823 on the site 
 of the old castle beside the Castle   
 River.                                
 Other notable buildings erected by the
 Grocers' Company are the Old Post     
 Office, the Courthouse (now a bank)   
 and the Manor House which has been    
 owned by the Davidson family for over 
 100 years. Four{Coronation Oaks}have  
 been planted by the Davidsons in 1902 
 (Edward V11), 1910 (George V), 1936   
 (George V1) and 1952 (Elizabeth II).
