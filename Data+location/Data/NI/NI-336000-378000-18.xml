		<title>18THE LEISURE SURVEY 17-40</title>
		<content>    All the people we interviewed      
 wanted a leisure centre in Holywood.  
 Some wanted playing fields as well.   
 The people we asked belonged to the   
 "Hob", a local club.  They thought    
 there should be a swimming pool, a    
 court for netball, basketball and     
 squash, a coffee bar, an ice rink and 
 indoor and outdoor equipment.  The    
 reasons they wanted a leisure centre  
 in Holywood were, - it was cheaper; it
 would get young people off the        
 streets; you would not have so far to 
 travel and the unemployed could save  
 money instead of spending it on the   
 bus fare to and from Belfast; it would
 provide a lot of new jobs; be more    
 convenient and keep up the community  
 spirit.
