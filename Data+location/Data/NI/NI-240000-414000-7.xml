		<content>{On Sunday,9th June,1985,six Ethiopians
{were found on a grain ship at         
{Londonderry. They had hidden on the   
{ship as they wanted to leave          
{Ethiopia.They did not want to fight in
{the civil war in their country.The    
{crew members had to give them         
{clothes.The ship called into various  
{ports on its way from Ethiopia but    
{each time they were refused admission.
{The U.K. government has allowed them  
{to stay for a while and the Red Cross 
{is looking after them. At the start,  
{no one could understand the Ethiopians
{but it turned out that there was an   
{Ethiopian living in Co.Donegal with   
{his family.  }
