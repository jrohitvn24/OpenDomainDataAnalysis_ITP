		<content> The{Trials Committee}have obtained the
 services of a{Scottish international  
{expert}to judge what should prove to  
 be an exciting day's trialing. The    
 sale of working collie and sheep dogs 
 begins at 2.0p.m. and it is expected  
 that there will be a number of very   
 good dogs for auction. As there was   
 very keen bidding  at the succesful   
 auction held the previous year it is  
 hoped that this will be an incentive  
 for handlers to put forward top dogs  
 for sale.                             
   In conjunction with the sheep dog   
 trials there will be the{Country Show 
 in the field with the local traders   
 exhibiting a wide variety of products.
   An event to look forward to will be 
 the{Charity Group Annual Dance}which  
 will be held Frid. 20th Sept.'85. The 
 venue for what is always an enjoyable 
 occasion is the Hanover House Hotel.  </content>
