		<content>       {Abbey Meats}is the largest meat
 plant in N.I. This abattoir employs   
 about 277 people,100 of whom work in  
 the boning hall.                      
        Normally 500 cattle are        
 slaughtered per day and from May to   
 August they also daily kill 300 sheep.
 They get the animals from N.I. farms, 
 cattle markets and also from Eire.    
        They kill an animal by firing a
 bolt from a stun gun at its forehead  
 and then a man called a "sticker"     
 sticks a knife in it which allows the 
 blood to be drained away. Two "hide   
 pullers" then remove the hides of the 
 animals which are sold to another     
 factory in N.I. The carcasses are cut 
 into pieces to be blast frozen, packed
 and sold.                             
        Abbey Meats export their       
 products by ship to the U.K. and by   
 air to Europe and the Middle East.    </content>
