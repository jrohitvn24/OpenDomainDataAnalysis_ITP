		<content>   The main centre of industry in the  
 area is the Hydepark Industrial       
 Estate. This has developed since the  
 1960's with government help and easy  
 access. Many businesses previously    
 located in Belfast have moved to this 
 area.                                 
   There are at least 100 different    
 business enterprises in this area,    
 employing well over 2000 people.  One 
 of the largest enterprises was a      
 Michelin works, producing tyres, but  
 this closed in 1981, making thousands 
 unemployed. This very large building  
 has now split up into smaller units of
 production.                           
   Several units in Hydepark operate as
 stores and wholesale shops, the vast  
 majority are small production sites.  
   There is little industry elsewhere  
 in the Glengormley area.
