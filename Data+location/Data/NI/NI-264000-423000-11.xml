		<title>11OCCUPATIONS IN LIMAVADY AREA</title>
		<content> Almost all of the middle class sector 
 of the population in our survey (98%) 
 is involved in{tertiary occupations,  
 including Civil Service, Banking,     
 Teaching, Social Services and         
 business.  None are involved in       
{primary occupations.                  
 In the{country district,}however, 22% 
 of households are involved in primary 
 occupations.  Most of these jobs are  
 directly concerned with agriculture,  
 the majority of people from the rural 
 district have to travel to work in the
 town.                                 
 Of all the households within the town 
 area over half are concerned with     
 tertiary activity.  Obviously in a    
 town many services are needed for the 
 public; such jobs include shop-       
 assistants, electricians, mechanics,  
 milkmen and postal workers.  15.4% of 
 the 460 people are unemployed.        </content>
