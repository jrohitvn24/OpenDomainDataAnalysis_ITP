		<content> We had fleas in Tiger's Bay.  We      
 called them 'flays'.  We waged war on 
 the fleas day and daily but they were 
 like ourselves- hard cases.  Every    
 once in a while a man from the local  
 health clinic would call at the school
 and search our heads.  Those found    
 giving aid and comfort to fleas or    
 nits were told to report to the clinic
 in North Queen Street, where their    
 heads were washed and scrubbed until  
 the last flea was snuffed out.  Still 
 and all, one of the more cosy domestic
 pastimes in Tiger's Bay was the       
 routine searching of each others's    
 hair in the kitchen of an evening.    
 Somehow it seemed to bring the family 
 very close together: while they were  
 using the fine comb they could relax  
 with each other, pass on secrets, and 
 let their hair down, so to speak.
