		<title>14LADIES IN ARMOY</title>
		<content>  At the football club in Armoy there  
 is a keep fit class every Monday      
 night.It starts at 7.00pm and ends at 
 8.30pm.Iris Stewart runs the classes  
 and puts the ladies through their     
 excercises.There are usually 15 ladies
 who go to the classes.The exercises   
 are dancing to records and they have  
 to run around the pitch as many times 
 as they can.They do exercises for     
 every part of the body.Some ladies go 
 to meetings every month.There is the  
 Presbyterian Womens                   
 Association(P.W.A.)and the Womens     
 Institute(W.I.).Both these groups meet
 on separate evenings in the church    
 hall.Speakers come to them and they   
 have outings and rallies.Some ladies  
 are farmers wives and some have other 
 work around the village, others just  
 work at home.                         
                                       </content>
