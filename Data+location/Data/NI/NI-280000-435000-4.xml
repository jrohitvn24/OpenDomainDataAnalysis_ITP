		<title>04The Strand at Portstewart</title>
		<content> Portstewart is fortunate to boast a   
 beautiful two mile long stretch of    
 golden sand known as "The Strand".    
 It is backed by a line of high sand   
 dunes stretching back to the River    
 Bann. Each summer many thousands of   
 tourists come to the strand, each     
 paying a pound a time to bring their  
 car onto the beach,which is now owned 
 by The National Trust.                
  As well as being a popular place for 
 bathing and playing, the beach is also
 popular with fishermen,canoeists and  
 surfers. It is also used for          
 parascending by a local club who also 
 give lessons to holidaymakers.        
  Boys in Primary four collected       
 mussel,periwinkle,limpet,snail and    
 cockle shells on the beach while      
 others enjoyed watching a wide variety
 of birds.
