		<content>    My Church is a{Presbyterian}Church.
 It has pine wood{pews}for the         
{congregation}and an oak{pulpit}for the
{minister.}There is a room for the     
 minister to robe and a room for the   
{choir}to meet. The choir sits on      
 either side of the pulpit and the     
 congregation sits facing the minister 
 and the choir in the body of the      
 Church. There is is a blue carpeted   
{aisle}between the pews. The light     
 comes through windows of beautiful    
 pictures in{coloured glass.}There is a
 kitchen and two toilets. I go to      
 Church,{Sunday School}and Choir       
 Practice every week. I like the       
 Services on Christmas Day best.       
    My cousin died and was buried in a 
 grave in the{Churchyard}beside the    
 Church. His name "Alexander Neill"is  
 on a granite{headstone.}
