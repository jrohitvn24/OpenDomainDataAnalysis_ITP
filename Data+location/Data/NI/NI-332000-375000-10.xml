 The {Mater Infirmorium Hospital,}on   
 the Crumlin road,was the idea of a    
 Mother Magdalen Malone of the Sisters 
 of Mercy.  In{1883}the Bishop bought  
 Bedequue House,a South American       
 residence, for Â£2,300 and it was      
 converted into a hospital of {34 beds 
{and a dispensary.}It was under the    
 care of the Sisters of Mercy and      
 remained so until 1972 when it became 
 part of the Health Service.  Bedeque  
 House quickly became too small and a  
 new building was opened in {1900}with 
{150}beds.  All sections of the        
 community were represented at the     
 opening ceremony.                     
     Today it has 246 beds with 8 wards
 plus Intensive Care and Maternity     
 units, with a number of other         
 departments being added over the      
 years.                    {contd.}    </content>
