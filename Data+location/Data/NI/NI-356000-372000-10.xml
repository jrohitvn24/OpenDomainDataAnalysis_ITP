		<title>10Brown's Beef Farm</title>
		<content> I live on a beef farm.  It consists of
 bullocks and a few fattening heifers. 
 There are quite a few different breeds
 of cattle on our farm - Simintals,    
 Fresians, Romogola and Charalois. Beef
 farmers do the same type of work as   
 dairy farmers except they don't have  
 to milk. In winter we feed the animals
 with silage they hay and straw.       
 Winter time is less busy than the     
 summer with the cutting of the silage.
 The animals must be feed twice a day  
 morning and night.The byre has to be  
 mucked out every day also.            
 Bullocks are usually bought at 2years 
 old and kept for a year feed on good  
 grass and silage.  Then its taken to  
 the abbatoir and slaughtered for your 
 Sunday Lunch.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
