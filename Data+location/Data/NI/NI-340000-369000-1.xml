 The area which we were asked to survey
 forms a small part of the Comber      
 hills in County Down, Northern        
 Ireland. This is a region of gently   
 rolling hills and narrow country roads
 approximately ten miles south - east  
 of {Belfast. }                        
                                       
 This region is mostly farming land set
 in peaceful and quiet countryside     
 containing many small, closely-knit   
 townlands. In our survey area the main
 townlands are {Ballystockart,         
{Ballyrussell, and Gransha,}where there
 are many small farms.                 
                                       
 The two features of particular        
 interest in the block are the {       
{Millbridge Riding Centre and School}at
 Ballystockart near{Comber}and close by
 the{Rockmount Quarries.}              </content>
