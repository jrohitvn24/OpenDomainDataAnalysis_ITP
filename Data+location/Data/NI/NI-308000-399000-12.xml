		<content>      Due to changing conditions of    
 employment many people to-day have had
 to find new jobs.  One such person,   
 who lives in our area, has used his   
 skill with metals, to develop his     
 interest into a small and successful  
 business.  He buys in copper and brass
 and turns these metals into very      
 fashionable canopies.  These canopies 
 are used for fire places and as covers
 for ventilators or fans.  The copper  
 is beaten, which gives it a dented    
 appearance, and polished so that it   
 looks bright and shiny.  As the       
 business grows, he now employs two men
 to help him; he sells his canopies to 
 people from all over County Antrim.   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
