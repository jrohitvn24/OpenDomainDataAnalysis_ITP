		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO THE AREA</title>
		<content> This area is situated outside the     
 small village of Ballygawley. It has  
 two main centres of population, Grange
 park and Lisdoart.                    
    Grange park consists of thirty two 
 houses and is situated beside the     
 Ballygawley roundabout. Lisdoart      
 consists of a row of late             
 nineteenth-century houses, which used 
 to house workers of the now derelict  
 textile factory. Most of the other    
 housing is in small privately owned   
 bungalows scattered over the whole    
 area.                                 
    These days the main industry is    
 farming, dairy farming, beef farming  
 and a few chicken farms. Most of the  
 farms are fifty to sixty acres. the   
 other two main industries are Booths  
 and Cootes.
