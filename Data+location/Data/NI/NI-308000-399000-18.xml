		<content> Modern medicine has made great        
 advances over the last number of      
 years.Many operations could be looked 
 upon as modern miracles.Only last     
 week it was reported in our local     
 paper about a young man ,eighteen     
 years old,who has been given a new    
 heart.He was the one hundredth and    
 tenth person to receive a heart       
 transplant operation at the famous    
 Papworth Hospital in Cambridge and the
 first from this area. The day after   
 the operation he was enjoying fruit   
 and ice-cream.                        
 Our school hockey team were ,for the  
 first time in their history,winners of
 the Mid-Antrim Primary Schools Hockey 
 League.They played eight matches in   
 their section of league and won them  
 all.In an exciting game they beat the 
 winners of the second section,an old  
 rival in a very exciting final game.  </content>
