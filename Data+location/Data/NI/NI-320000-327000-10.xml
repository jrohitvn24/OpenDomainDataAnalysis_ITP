		<content> There aren't really any politicians in
 Hilltown but there are two concillers 
 who have been elected and voted in by 
 the people.One is Ciarn Mussen of the 
 Independant Party and the other       
 conciller is Patsy Harper for the     
 Social Democratic and Labour          
 Party.These two men have been voted in
 to represent the people of Hilltown   
 and district.They are responsible for 
 the upkeep of Hilltown,such as the    
 cleaning of the streets,waste         
 disposal,street lighting and any      
 complaint the public might have.They  
 are also responsible for housing      
 schemes and building.At present they  
 are planning to have a playground and 
 a park with a tennis court in the     
 village vacinity.There is a monthly   
 meeting at which all concillers meet  
 to put forward any proposals which may
 arise. BY KELLY GALLAGHER             </content>
