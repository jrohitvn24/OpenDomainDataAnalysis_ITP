		<content> Our area  has a lot of farmland and   
 very few houses. There are some potato
 fields. There are only three housing  
 estates.{Goshaden,Ardground and Gulf. 
 The Gulf has 20 houses,Goshaden has 24
 houses and Ardground has 22 houses.The
{River Faughan}runs past our school    
 to the River Foyle. There are a few   
 picnic areas around. You can see the  
 remains of the old main road but a    
 farmer made half of it into a field   
 and an other quarter was made into a  
 picnic area.
