		<content>  Education in Comber has developed    
 over the years as the town has grown. 
  At the moment there are no nursery   
 schools in the town but plans have    
 been made to build one in the grounds 
 of Comber Primary School.             
  Comber Elementary School was built   
 in 1938.Children left at th age of 14 
 to go to work.The 1948 Education Act  
 raised the school leaving age to 15\  
 and so in the 1950s Comber High       
 School was built to accommodate pupils
 of 12+.Comber Elementary School became
 Comber Primary School.                
  As the population grew another       
 primary school ,Andrew's Memorial, was
 opened in 1974 to take children who   
 lived on the south side of the town.  
  The nearest grammar school is Regent 
 House School, a mixed school of over  
 1000 pupils which is 4 miles away in  
 Newtownards.                          </content>
