		<content>       The R.U.C. Recreation Centre    
     The Royal Ulster Constabulary's   
 Recreation Centre is situated in      
 Kilroot near the shore. Formerly the  
 property belonged to I.C.I. but since 
 August 1984 the{R.U.C.}have started to
 refurnish and decorate the centre.    
 There are only two of these centres in
{Northern Ireland,}but this is the main
 one and it caters for{2,500 people    
 each week. Three people manage the    
 centre and they do a good job.        
     There are{54 acres}of land owned  
 by the centre. Part of this area has  
 been turned into a football pitch and 
 a cricket ground. The centre has      
 numerous facilities, a large hall, a  
 kitchen, a restaurant, a bar, and a   
 lounge. The large hall can seat{250   
 for a meal and{650}for a concert. The 
 hall can be used as a cinema by       
 putting a large screen on the stage.  </content>
