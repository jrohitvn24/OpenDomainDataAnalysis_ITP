		<content> The area is quite sparsely populated  
 with many inhabitants being full or   
 part-time farmers or farm labourers.  
 Housing consists of approx. 10 large  
 farmhouses,numerous cottages and small
 bungalows. Within the past twenty     
 years numerous rural 'family-homes'   
 have also been built here and some    
 are still under construction. Most    
 people living in these houses and     
 larger bungalows,who work, commute to 
 Lisburn by car.There is one rural     
 housing estate in the far N.W.        
   Apart from agriculture,employment   
 for some inhabitants is provided by   
 quarries,fireplace builders concrete  
 works and a few are employed by the   
 D.O.E.Forked Bridge Water Filtration  
 Plant.Here the water from the nearby  
 Stoneyford Reservoir is purified      
 before being pumped on to North       
 Lisburn and West Belfast.             </content>
