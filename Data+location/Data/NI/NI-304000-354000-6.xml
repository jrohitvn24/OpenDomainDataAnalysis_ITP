		<content>{TRACTORS                              
 There is hard work on farms, but there
 is also danger, especially to young   
 people. Just a few days ago a boy aged
 ten was driving a Ford 3910 in his    
 daddy's orchard and drove over his    
 older sister killing her. This scene  
 took place in April 1985.}            
{SLURRY PITS }These can be very        
 dangerous. An example of this is when 
 I was helping a man called Billy      
 Craney to put slurry out, when he     
 turned on the drive-shaft to stir the 
 slurry until it was ready to be spread
 in the field. Then suddenly out of    
 nowhere gas began to suck me into the 
 pit. I was slowly being dragged to the
 pit. Luckily Billy saw me and without 
 thinking he ran over to me and tried  
 holding me back, but he couldn't. So  
 running over, he turned it off.       
 This scene took place in  1983.       </content>
