		<content> My Daddy was a slater before he went  
 out of work.He has been out of work   
 for one and a half years.It started   
 when he twisted his ankle.During the  
 day he does any jobs which need done  
 about the house.Sometimes his friend  
 comes up and they go out for a run    
 with the dog.                         
      My Daddy's friend keeps a        
 greyhound.He races it in Dundalk.Most 
 of the times my Daddy goes to the     
 Communittee Centre in Loanda House and
 fixes anything which is broken for the
 disco.Sometimes in the evenings he    
 goes down and plays bowls and         
 snooker.Every  Tuesday he goes to a   
 meeting because he is on the Committee
 of the Centre.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
