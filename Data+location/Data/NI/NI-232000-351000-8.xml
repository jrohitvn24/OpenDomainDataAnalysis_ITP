		<content>      Most farmers in this district    
 keep suckling herds as the quality of 
 the land is poor.The size of herds    
 range from about fifteen to thirty    
 cows.                                 
      The cows are a variety of breeds 
 normally Friesians,Shorthorns and     
 Charolais.The cows calf in Spring.The 
 calves suck their mothers' milk.When  
 they are about nine to twelve months  
 old they are sold.                    
      During the Summer months hay has 
 to be made to feed the cows during the
 Winter.First the long green grass is  
 cut.It is left to dry for about three 
 days before being turned with a hay   
 flash.In another day or so the hay is 
 put into rows to be baled.When it is  
 baled it is stored in a large shed.
