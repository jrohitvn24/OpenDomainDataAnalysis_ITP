		<title>07CHURCHES AROUND ARMOY</title>
		<content>  The church that is nearest to the    
 school is the Presbyterian church.    
 The minster is the Rev McAteer and he 
 lives in the manse opposite the church
 The Girls Brigade is held in the      
 church hall, which used to be Armoy   
 Primary School before the new school  
 was built.                            
  The Glenshesk Road takes you up to   
 the Church of Ireland, whose minster  
 is the Rev McCrory. He is also the    
 minster for Drumtullagh and Loughguile
 Beside the Church of Ireland is a very
 famous landmark, the Round Tower. It  
 was built when the Vikings came a long
 time ago.It was built to keep the     
 monks and people of Armoy safe from   
 the invaders. Lots of people come to  
 look at the Round Tower, some from as 
 far away as America. Further up the   
 Glenshesk Road is a Roman Catholic    
 church. The priest is Father Hurl.    </content>
