 situated at Bryantang was erected in  
 1831 at a cost of Â£90.00,the "master" 
 living below the schoolroom, with an  
 'income' of Â£24.00 per year.   As well
 as the 28 pupils the mistress, Mr.    
 Boyd's wife, taught an 'unlimited'    
 number of girls plain and fancy       
 needlework for two hours a day.  The  
 present school, built in 1894 was     
 transferred to the Regional Education 
 Committee in February 1926.           
       The renovation and extension    
 which provided a better cloakroom     
 area, a dining hall and a meals       
 kitchen was completed in 1963.

 and laid out in 1964.

 members of staff  and 3l children on  
 rolls.
