		<content> LIME IS USED FOR BUILDING, FERTILIZER 
 OR TO WHITEWASH HOUSES.IN BELLEEK     
 THERE IS A LIME KILN KNOWN AS         
 GRAYSONS.IT WAS A COMMERCIAL KILN     
 LINED WITH FIRESTONE.THERE WERE MANY  
 KILNS OVER THE COUNTRY BUT NONE AS BIG
 AS THIS ONE.ALTERNATE LAYERS OF TURF  
 AND STONE WERE INSERTED AND A PILLAR  
 OF TURF WAS BUILT UP THE CENTRE       
 OF THE KILN AS A WICK TO KEEP THE KILN
 BURNING. WHEN THE KILN IS SET ALIGHT  
 IT MIGHT TAKE SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE IT  
 WAS FINISHED BURNING AND HAD TO BE    
 ATTENDED NEARLY ALL THE TIME TO       
 CONTROL THE AIR SUPPLY THE QUARRY FOR 
 THE LIMESTONE WAS NEARBY.A MAN WAS    
 PAID TO BREAK THE STONE BECAUSE IT    
 WOULD NOT BURN IN BIG PIECES.THE      
 LIMESTONE AROUND BELLEEK IS A PURE    
 FORM OF LIMESTONE AND MAKES VERY GOOD 
 LIME.IT HAS NOT BEEN USED FOR MANY    
 YEARS AND IS NOW OVERGROWN WITH BRIARS</content>
