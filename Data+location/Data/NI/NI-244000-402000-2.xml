		<content> To cater for the various religious    
 beliefs in the Donemana area we have  
 five churches.Four for Protestants and
 one for Roman Catholics.The           
 Presbyterian Church in Church View has
 as its minister the Rev Logue with    
 250_300 famillies under his care.The  
 Curch of Ireland at Earlsgift has the 
 Rev McNee as Rector and has a similar 
 number of families among his          
 congregation.The other two Protestant 
 Churches are the Baptist Hall and the 
 Gospel Hall.Both have very small      
 congregations.The Roman Catholic      
 Church of St Patricks is about half a 
 mile from the village.It has a seating
 capacity of 1,000,most of its members 
 coming from the surrounding districts 
 and very few from the village itself.
