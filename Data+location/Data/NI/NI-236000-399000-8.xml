		<title>08ANCIENT BURIAL SITE.</title>
		<content> When making our survey of the block,  
 we noticed the marking of an Ancient  
 Burial Site, named the Rocking Stone. 
 It is located to the east of          
 Artigarvan (top right hand square of  
 our block)                            
 We found one very large stone, resting
 on some smaller stones.The dimensions 
 of the rock were as follows :-        
 (1) Circumference width - 9.1 metres. 
 (2) Circumference height - 7.3 metres.
 The Site is not documented locally.At 
 school, we found out the following    
 information, indicating that it was a 
{DOLMEN.}They were made from three or  
 more standing stones, which supported 
 a large capstone.Sometimes they were  
 partially covered by a cairn of       
 stones, but, as in our case, this     
 cairn has disappeared.Dolmens were    
 made between the Neolithic and Bronze 
 age-(approx. c25OO .BC. - c21OO .BC.) </content>
