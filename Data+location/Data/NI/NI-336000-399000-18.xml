		<title>18HARVEY'S MILL, KILWAUGHTER</title>
		<content> Kilwaughter townland flows with       
 springs. One of them provides power to
 the giant 20 ft waterwheel of Harvey's
 Mill, built about 150 years ago, of   
 basalt. One inside wall is a wonderful
 example of the mason's great skill.   
 The waterwheel drives all the circular
 saws, cross-cuts, drills and lathes,  
 with which the present Mr Harvey      
 produces finished timber from local   
 tree trunks. The patina of age covers 
 everything. The workshops contain many
 antiques such as hand-operated washing
 machines, butter churns, pony trap and
 farm cart - all being repaired. Mr    
 Harvey's great skill can be seen in   
 the almost-finished miniature Irish   
 Jaunting Car. He has fears about cont-
 amination of the stream, that he owns.
 Mr Harvey works hard to keep going,   
 the mill which has been in his family 
 for several generations.              </content>
