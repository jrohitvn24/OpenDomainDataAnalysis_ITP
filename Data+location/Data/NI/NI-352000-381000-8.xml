		<title>08CARAVAN INTERVIEWS</title>
		<content>   We interviewed 15 caravan owners    
 altogether and discovered that most   
 people lived in and around Belfast.   
 They all liked Groomsport a lot and   
 thought that the facilities were good 
 there.Many enjoyed the walks in the   
 area especially around Ballymacormick.
     We found that many older couples  
 stayed in the caravans and they came  
 from Belfast.One person had been      
 staying there for 21 years.It seemed  
 that people came to Groomsport mainly 
 because of the peace and quiet and    
 also because it is near to Bangor.    
     Quite a few caravan groups stayed 
 from April to September(all the       
 caravans were classified as 'static   
 owned').One man we interviewed said   
 only his wife and himself lived there 
 but sometimes their children visited  
 them.He noted that the harbour had    
 been dredged recently.                </content>
