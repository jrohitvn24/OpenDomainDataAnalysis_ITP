		<content> The farming in this particular area   
 is mainly dairy farming. Most of the  
 land is intensively managed grasslands
 for grazing cattle. There are very few
 crops other than grass except for a   
 few fields of silage or barley.The    
 area is rather hilly and there are    
 quite alot of sheep on the rough      
 grazing. There is a small area of     
 marsh land outside Milford where there
 are a lot of rushes.{There is also a  
{350 acre farm in Milford which        
{belonged to the mill. This was mainly 
{a dairy farm  with 50 fresian cows    
{and 50 jersey cows ,they employed     
{about 13 people working for them. They
{were paid about nine pounds per week. 
 This farm is no longer  working.      
 Most other farms are smaller.
