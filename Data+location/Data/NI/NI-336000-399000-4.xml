		<title>04TROUT FARM</title>
		<content> There are several trout farms in this 
 block, all of which need fresh, clean 
 natural water. At the one we visited, 
 the ponds and tanks get fresh water   
 from a famous spring. The water runs  
 down to a filter, and on down to all  
 the tanks and ponds. The eggs are     
 stripped from the female and are put  
 into plastic containers where they are
 mixed with "milt" from the male trout 
 and kept until they hatch. They are   
 transferred to shallow tanks where    
 they are fed 8 times a day with a high
 protein food made from fish products. 
 They proceed to larger tanks and      
 finally to outdoor ponds, measuring 10
 metres long, 5 metres wide and 2      
 metres deep. They reach full maturity 
 in 3 years. The main impressions are, 
 the gush of water, and the dark swarm 
 of thousands of rainbow trout,        
 destined to restock lakes and rivers. </content>
