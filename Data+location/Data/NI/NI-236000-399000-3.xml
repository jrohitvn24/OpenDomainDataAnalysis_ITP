		<title>03LECKPATRICK CO-OP DAIRY.</title>
		<content> Leckpatrick Co-Op was founded in 19O2 
 to process the milk produced by dairy 
 farmers in the area.In those days the 
 milk was separated, the cream churned 
 into butter, and the skim milk        
 returned to the farmer for stock      
 feeding.As milk production increased  
 the Co-Op grew and so it had to       
 develop new markets.Today the Co-Op   
 complex at Artigarvan consists of :-  
 (1) Butter Department.                
 (2) Skim milk powder department.      
 (3) Bottle and cartoned milk          
     distribution network.             
 (4) Agricultural and domestic         
     department.                       
 (5) Animal feed mill complex and      
     barley drying.                    
 The creamery now employs 11O - 13O    
 people.They are involved in the       
 collection, processing, marketing and 
 distribution of milk and it's products</content>
