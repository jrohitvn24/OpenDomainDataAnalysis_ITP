 Hilden Mill as it was then called was 
 founded in 1784 by John Barbour who   
 came from Paisley in Scotland.  It    
 then made linen thread but today makes
 a mixture of linen and synthetic      
 thread.                               
                                       
 The mill like the textile industry was
 at its peak in the 1930s and then     
 employed over 2000 workers.  Today    
 with the fall in demand for thread and
 the loss of jobs due to mechanisation 
 it employs only 570.  However it is   
 still one of the largest employers in 
 the Lisburn area.                     
                                       
 Barbour Campbell Threads Ltd is now   
 part of the Hanson Trust Group of     
 Companies.
