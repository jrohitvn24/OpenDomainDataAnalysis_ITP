		<content> The farmers in the Shimna Valley to   
 the North of the block own most of the
 hill land 'in common'. Each farmer can
 graze a certain number of sheep on the
 hill land adjacent to his farm.       
 Privately owned land extends up to the
 Mourne Wall (see later).              
 The hill land is used for rough       
 pasture for Blackface sheep for most  
 of the year. The ewes (pronounced     
 yeows locally) are only brought to the
 lower valley fields for dipping, and  
 for lambing in February and March. In 
 very severe winter weather they may be
 brought off the mountains to more     
 accessible areas.                     
 The extreme North-West corner of the  
 block contains some of the valley     
 farms and fields. These are almost all
 used for pasture at this altitude. The
 farms (excluding the associated       
 mountain grazing) are small units.    </content>
