		<title>12A PUPILS DAY IN THE DERG.</title>
		<content> The alarm wakes me at 7.00 am and I   
 get ready for school.  After preparing
 and eating my breakfast I go and wake 
 my brothers and sisters for school.   
   At 7.45 am we walk to the end of the
 road to catch the school bus which    
 picks us up at 7.55 am.  We arrive at 
 school at 8.30 am and its straight to 
 the cloakrooms.  After the hymn and   
 prayer we go form class to have our   
 register marked.  Then it is off to   
 Maths and French.  After break I have 
 two classes of Physics followed by    
 Chemistry and then 40 minutes for     
 dinner.  Two classes of Sociology     
 followed by one of Physics rounds off 
 the day, and then the rush to the bus.
   I arrive home at 4.00 pm, take a    
 quick snack and take the dog out.  At 
 6.00 we have our tea and then I go and
 do some homework. I go to bed at 11   
 pm.                                   </content>
