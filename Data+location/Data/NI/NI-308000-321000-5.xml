		<content> In block 2 there is a small, compact  
 sweet factory unit situated about two 
 and a half miles from Newry Town      
 Centre.  It is run by the Crilly      
 family and locally known as Crilco    
 Ltd.  The firm is engaged in the      
 manufacture of sugar rock, boiled     
 sweets and toffees.  Its continued    
 existence over the last thirty years  
 is due to the talents and dedication  
 of the Crilly ancestors who started   
 this business as only a domestic      
 industry.  The workers in the factory 
 are all local people.  In the winter  
 months about 30 work in Crilco.       
 However, throughout the summer the    
 number of employees increases to 50   
 and the youth of the Cloghogue area   
 employed there receive Â£25 for a five 
 day week.  This is due to the bigger  
 demand for confectionary from the     
 resorts of Warrenpoint and Omeath.    </content>
