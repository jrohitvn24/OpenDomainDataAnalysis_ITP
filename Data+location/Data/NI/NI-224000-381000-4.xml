		<content>       In a small town called          
 Castlederg all those 25 years ago.    
 The rural Castlederg area was         
 revolutionized with the building of a 
 new Â£125,000 Secondary School.        
       School transport was introduced 
 in the Sixties because we are such a  
 rural area.  They used to parked in   
 the school grounds outside the gym    
 hall until they were bombed in        
 August,1972.  A 50-100 pound bomb     
 wrecked three buses and damaged six.  
       The school today has over 470   
 pupils, with 29 teachers, a youth     
 tutor and a{HEADMASTER}Mr John Dunbar 
 MBE. The majority of pupils come from 
 rural families in the surrounding     
 areas, these are {Ardstraw,Killen,    
{Spamount,Drumquin,Newtownstewart,     
{Drumlegagh,Killeter and Castlederg.} {
