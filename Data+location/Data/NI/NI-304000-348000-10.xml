		<content> A musical society is about to be      
 formed in autumn of 1985. It is hoped 
 to attract as many young people as    
 posible to carry on the tradition of  
 dramatic activity in the town and     
 surrounding district. A dramatic      
 society existed in the local Catholic 
 Club Hall since 1901. Irish Dancing is
 still popular with the young children 
 who travel to neighbouring            
 Laurencetown for their lessons each   
 Saturday morning. They compete in     
 Feiscama in neighbouring towns. There 
 are two bands in Gilford, Gilford Pipe
 Band and the Robert Harrison Memorial 
 Flute Band. In St John's Primary      
 School, Gilford tin whistle music has 
 been introduced and the children now  
 perform at concerts and parties for   
 the senior citizens. In Gilford Castle
 musical and cultural events take place
 sponsored by the Arts Council.        </content>
