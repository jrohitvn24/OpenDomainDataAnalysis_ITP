		<title>17I Like Hillsborough</title>
		<content>{My name is Anya}and I came to live in 
 Hillsborough in 1983.{I am 11 years   
{old.                                  
{   The village is small and pleasant  
{and the people very friendly.}Our     
 houses are not as cramped as those in 
 Belfast and we have bigger gardens.   
   {There are many organizations}to    
 keep people occupied such as the Girls
 Brigade, Boys Brigade, Guides and     
 Scouts.                               
    On warm days{you can visit the park
 or because we're in the country you   
 can ask a farmer's permission and have
 a picnic in one of his fields.        
   {Shops are handy,}so you don't need 
 a car to get the week's groceries.    
 Hillsborough is a busy little village 
 but our streets aren't crowded, we    
 don't have much hustle and bustle.    
  { I like Hillsborough and I'm very   
{glad I don't live anywhere else.      </content>
