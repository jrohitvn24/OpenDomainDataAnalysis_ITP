		<content> All of the homes in the area rely on  
 electricity for lighting.  Bottle gas 
 is used extensively for cooking       
 purposes as is electricity. Homes are 
 generally heated by means of solid    
 fuel but a number of privately owned  
 homes use fuel oil. At certain times  
 of the year turf men come around      
 selling turf which has been dug and   
 dried in the Montiagh district, north 
 of Lurgan. In the middle of the 19th  
 Century coal was found in the townland
 of Knocknagore. It was uneconomical   
 being of a lignite type. A coal       
 company was formed in Lawrencetown in 
 1872 but it folded due the poor       
 quality of the product. Perhaps now   
 that lignite is being mined in the    
 Lough Neagh basin it will again be    
 re-opened.
