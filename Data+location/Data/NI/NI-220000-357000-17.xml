		<title>17Turf or Peat :JENNIFER</title>
		<content> For{centuries turf}or{peat}has been   
 cut from the bogland for use as fuel. 
 This is the old way for cutting turf. 
 In April the turf bank is pared or    
 cleared of any growth like heather.   
 Three men are needed, one man cuts    
 with a spade, one man puts the cut    
 turf on the barrow and the other man  
 wheels to a spread floor. You need    
 good weather for the turf to dry and  
 if it does not rain they can be put in
 clamps which are piles of turf. After 
 a week if the turf are dry they are   
 bagged and brought home.The tools used
 are a turf spade which has a long     
 shaft and a curved blade,the barrow is
 wooden and has no sides on it.Recently
 machines pulled by tractors are being 
 used to cut the turf. A chain cuts the
 peat and an auger forces it through   
 pipes on to the ground where it dries.
 This method is much faster and easier.</content>
