		<title>08THE ALTAR GLEN IN ALTAMUSKIN</title>
		<content> During the penal days Catholics were  
 not allowed to worship publicly,so    
 people of the area came together for  
 Mass in a glen among the hills in     
 Altamuskin.After the raising of       
 the penal laws,Sunday Mass was still  
 celebrated regularly in Altamuskin    
 but on a more convenient and sheltered
 site along the roadway,{a site that   
{has been retained to the present day, 
 but with some changes, particularly   
 with regard to the altar.             
   While in surrounding areas, people  
 gathered together in suitable churches
 these people had to endure outdoor    
 field conditions. On Sunday mornings a
 table and other needs were brought    
 from a nearby house.                  
   In 1868 a Church was erected a short
 distance away in Dunmoyle,{but the    
{Altar Glen is still special here, and 
{has its Annual Commemoration in July. </content>
