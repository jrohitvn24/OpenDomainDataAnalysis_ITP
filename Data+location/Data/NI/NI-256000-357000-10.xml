		<title>10ERRIGAL,FARMING.</title>
		<content>  Farming is the only industry carried 
 on in this area. Six farmers keep     
 dairy herds and these vary in size    
 from twenty cows to seventy cows.     
 Other farmers keep suckling herds,beef
 cattle and sheep.                     
  The number of dairy farmers has      
 decreased over the past decade. Bulk  
 milk collection, which necessitated   
 the farmer having to install a        
 refrigerated milk storage tank instead
 of ten gallon cans which were         
 collected daily, was one factor. In   
 1984 the introduction of milk quotas, 
 requiring farmers to curtail their    
 milk yield due to national            
 over-production, caused uncertainty   
 among milk producers. Other farmers   
 took advantage of government subsidies
 to change from milk production to     
 fattening cattle.
