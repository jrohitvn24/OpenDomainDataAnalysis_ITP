		<content>    There is only one bus company which
 is called Ulsterbus. Not so many      
 people use buses now because they have
 motor cars and motor bikes which      
 are more popular and cheaper. Some    
 people go to live in towns and cities 
 in Northern Ireland so that they do   
 not have travelling costs.            
    There is no train station in       
 Ballywalter. Many years ago there was 
 a plan to make a railway station but  
 it  was not built. There was one in   
 Newtownards but it closed.            
    Our small roads are quite good but 
 some would need widening because they 
 are too busy at week-ends. Bus loads  
 of people come down at the week-ends  
 from Belfast. We would need a         
 motor-way from here to Belfast because
 the road we have has too many bends.
