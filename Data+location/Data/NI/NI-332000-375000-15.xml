		<title>15ROARING HUGH          contd.</title>
		<content> No-one knew what to do with the       
 statue, and even the congregation of  
 St.Enoch's was divided as to what     
 should happen to Roaring Hugh.  They  
 would have liked him back where he    
 belonged, but the ast explosion had   
 caused the removal of the church      
 spire.                                
   The last definite news of the stone 
 "Hugh Hanna" was in 1976 when he was  
 due to be put back in his rightful    
 place, but since then nothing has been
 heard.  No-one knows where the statue 
 is (or if they do they're not         
 telling), but it's certainly not back 
 in Carlisle Circus.  Perhaps Roaring  
 Hugh has finally gone to that Great   
 Pulpit in the sky!                    
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
