		<title>08PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPIL'S DAY</title>
		<content> I get up at 7.30am,wash,dress and have
 my breakfast. Usually I have museli or
 toast.  At 8.30am I call for my friend
 Joanne and we walk to school together.
 Our school day begins with an{Assembly
 then our teacher takes all our lessons
 during the day. We have a break of ten
 minutes in mid morning and lunch is at
 12.45pm.                              
  Sometimes I stay after school to take
 part in{aerobics, netball, hockey}or I
 sing in the choir.                    
 At tea time I have my main meal of the
 day and it is my job to wash dishes. I
 spend the next half hour doing written
{homework}and then I am free to call on
 my friends.   We like to play rounders
 or go cycling.  From 9.30pm to 10.30pm
 I watch{television}before bedtime.
