		<title>01CRUMLIN VILLAGE</title>
		<content>      Crumlin is a small, even sleepy  
 village which has undergone a major   
 transformation in the past few years. 
 The population has shown a marked     
 increase and six new estates have been
 built to accommodate the people.      
      The nature and character of the  
 village has also changed as Crumlin   
 has become more of a dormitory        
 settlement.                           
      Situated in a null spot between  
 the larger towns of Antrim and Lisburn
 and being about 12 miles from the city
 of Belfast , Crumlin is now ideally   
 suited for its new role.              
      The recent discovery of large    
 deposits of LIGNITE ( brown coal ) in 
 the nearby Lough Neagh basin will     
 probably further change the nature of 
 the Crumlin area.
