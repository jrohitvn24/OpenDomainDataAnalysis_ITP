		<title>19BATTLE OF GLENTAISIE II</title>
		<content> His army outnumbered the Scots by two 
 to one. After a long bloody struggle  
 the Scots were literally annihilated. 
 All the officers were either killed or
 captured and of the men few were left 
 afterwards.                           
                                       
 This was one of the battles which     
 ensured that Shane O'Neill became the 
 paramount Gaelic chieftain in Ulster  
 and as a result he was to lead a      
 rebellion against the rule of the     
 English in the 1590's which came close
 to success.
