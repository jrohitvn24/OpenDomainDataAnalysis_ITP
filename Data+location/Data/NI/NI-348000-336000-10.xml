		<content> Farming is the largest employer in the
 area _ however many of the farms are  
 faimly run and only "employ" the      
 immediate family. A few farms would   
 employ outside labour; drawn from the 
 area.                                 
 There is no industry in the area and  
 few industrial workers; those there   
 are travel to Downpatrick,            
 Ballynahinch or Killyleagh and Belfast
 to work.                              
 A large proportion of men in the area 
 are involved in the building trade    
 either as skilled tradesmen or as     
 labourers. They as a rule work outside
 the area.                             
 Professional people _ doctors, nurses,
 teachers, civil servants etc., must   
 travel to their work.
