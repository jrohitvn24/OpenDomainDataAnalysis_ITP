		<title>11  A Day At Downpatrick Races</title>
		<content> Downpatrick races is always a cracking
 day out.I usually go with my Dad.He   
 says he goes to the Grandstand to get 
 a good view __ but I know it's 'cos he
 likes a bet.I prefer to stand near one
 of the jumps.                         
   My grandad says it takes a good     
 horse to win here. It is a hard course
 to jump and if you know where to watch
 you see some really crashing falls.   
 Most of the falls come at the "swing" 
 fence _ that's at the top of the hill 
 three from home.The jockeys say the   
 fence is too sheer and there's no room
 for the slightest mistake _ you hear  
 some real bad language out at that    
 fence.In the stands, autograph hunting
 is easy if you hang around the weigh  
 in room. All in all it's a real good  
 day out,but you should hear my dad    
 when he loses a few pounds!
