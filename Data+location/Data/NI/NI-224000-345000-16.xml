 The land at Drumgarrow is much better 
 than that of Garvary(see page 20) and 
 this is mainly because it is lower    
 down.In the winter it is not as cold  
 in Drumgarrow as it is in Garvary,so  
 the grass is much better.It is greener
 and fresher.ther are not as many      
 fields with rushes in them.The soil is
 better and deeper.There are more trees
 growing around Drumgarrow than        
 Garvary.The name Drumgarrow may       
 suggest there are small hills         
 around.In irish the word "drum" means 
 ridge or hill.The drumlins are were   
 formed by sliding ice.The drumlins are
 made of a substance called            
 bolder-clay.This land is used for     
 grazing cattle.
