		<title>12PLACE NAMES OF BALLYGALLY</title>
		<content> Because we are so close to Scotland , 
 many of our people are of Scottish    
 descent, and our place names have     
 Scottish as well as Irish origins. For
 instance, the Gaelic for townland was 
 "bally", while a "carn" or "cairn" was
 a monumental heap of stones ,perhaps  
 marking a chieftain's grave. Here are 
 some of our place names :             
{BALLYGALLY  }= Townland of brightness.
{BALLYWILLIN} = Townland of the mill.  
{BALLYTOBER}  = Townland of the well.  
{TOBERGELL   }= Clear well.            
{CARNCASTLE  }= Castle on the hill or  
                carn.                  
{CAIRNDHU   } = Black carn or blackrock
{CARNFUNNOCK} = Hill of the hooded crow
{DROAGH     } = Sandy bridge.          
{DRAIN'S BAY }= Bay of the blackthorns.
 (Even today you can see plenty of     
 blackthorn bushes forming hedges along
 the roads of this area.)              </content>
