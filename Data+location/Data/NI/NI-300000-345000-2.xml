		<title>02   Tandragee's Motto</title>
		<content>  One time, however, due to the        
 curtailment of the lactation of and   
 the subsequent dimimution in supply by
 the providers, the milk from time to  
 time ran out, so there was none to be 
 had for the making of tea, not even at
 the castle dairy.                     
  Fortunately, however there was always
 plenty of clear, pure spring water on 
 the boil on the hospitable Tandragee  
 hearths for the purpose  of mixing    
 with the whiskey to make punch during 
 the colder days.
