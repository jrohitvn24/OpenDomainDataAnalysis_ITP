		<content> On the 10th May, 1985, a class of     
 twenty-five girls from Ashfield Girls'
 High in Belfast went to Holywood for a
 neighbourhood study, to find out what 
 the residents' thoughts were about    
 living in Holywood, and how it had    
 changed over the years.               
                                       
 The oldest resident we interviewed had
 been living in Holywood for seventy   
 years and one person for sixty years. 
                                       
 Our study consisted of thirteen       
 questions which showed some startling 
 revelations.  The main reasons that   
 people stay in Holywood are because it
 is nice and quiet; there are a lot of 
 friendly people and plenty of shops.  
                                       
 The main problems in Holywood are the 
 poor state of the roads and also the  
 lack of facilities for children.      </content>
