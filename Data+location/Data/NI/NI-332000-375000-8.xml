		<title>08CLIFTON HOUSE</title>
		<content>{ Clifton House}is one of the oldest   
 public buildings in Belfast.When it   
 was opened in{1774}it was both a{     
{poorhouse and hospital}, the first one
 in Belfast.It had 7 beds for sick     
 people and 30 for the poor.It was     
 built in fields on a hill near the    
 main road to Carrickfergus,and over a 
 town of mainly {thatched cottages}.The
 residents would have had a good       
 view ,of the naval battle of 1776     
 between the American Paul Jones'      
 "Ranger"and the British ship "Drake", 
 which the Americans won.Today,        
 although still on a main road, it is  
 surrounded by houses,shops and blocks 
 of flats.
