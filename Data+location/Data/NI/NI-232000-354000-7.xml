		<content>There are 2 primary schools but no     
Grammar, Secondary or Play Schools in  
this block.                            
                                       
The Secondary Schools are found in     
Omagh, but some children chose to      
travel to those in the neighbouring    
county.                                
                                       
The reason why 2 primary schools are   
found in such a small area is that     
this is a mixed relgion area.          
                                       
The Protestants and other small sects  
attend the State Primary School called 
Trillick County Primary.               
The Roman Catholics send their         
children to St.Scires a school         
controlled by the Roman Catholic       
Church.                                
150 primary school children attend     
these two primary schools.             </content>
