		<content> THE POST OFFICE OPENS EVERY MORNING AT
 9:00. THE FIRST THING WE DO IS FIX THE
 DATE STAMP TO THE PROPER DATE. THEN   
 WE HAVE TO BRING ALL STOCKS OUT OF A  
 SECURE PLACE. THE SERVICE TO THE      
 CUSTOMERS USUALLY STARTS WITH LETTERS,
 STAMPS ETC. AT 1:00-2:00 WE HAVE A    
 BREAK AND ALL STOCK IS AGAIN MOVED.   
 THE MONEY FLOW TAKEN ACROSS IS USUALLY
 MADE FROM THE PAYMENT OF ELECTRICTY   
 AND TELEPHONE ACCOUNTS AND FOR        
 INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS SAVINGS. ONE OF
 THE TIME CONSUMING EFFORTS IN THE POST
 OFFICE IS THE FILLING OF VARIOUS FORMS
 PARTICULARY FOR THE ELDERY. AT THE END
 OF THE DAY ALL TRANSACTIONS HAVE TO BE
 TOTALLED UP. WE GET A MIDWEEK BREAK ON
 WEDNESDAY WHEN THE POST OFFICE IS     
 OFFICALLY CLOSED AT 12:30 IT ALSO     
 CLOSES AT 12:30 ON SATURDAYS.         
                                       
                                       </content>
