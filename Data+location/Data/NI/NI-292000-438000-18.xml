HOUSING                                
 Houses people lived in about 50 years 
ago were usually white washed, thatched
cottages with no electricity and       
paraffin lamps for light. There were   
usually 3 rooms and in one of the rooms
there is a large open fire where most  
of the cooking was done.               
 Unlike today there was no toilet      
inside the house.  It was usually      
outside in a wee shed or hut.  There   
were no taps or pumps to pump the water
to the homes but you would usually have
had to walk 3 or 4 hundred yards to the
nearest water supply.  In the house    
itself there was a surprising amount of
furniture with one bedroom which had to
be shared with the amount of people    
living in the house. Today there are   
rarely more than two people per room.  </content>
