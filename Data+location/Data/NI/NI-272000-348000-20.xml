		<title>20AN INTERVIEW WITH A LOCAL</title>
		<content> HAVE YOU ALWAYS LIVED HERE?           
 Yes I was born in the house that I am 
 presently living in.                  
 WOULD YOU LIKE TO MOVE?               
 No,because my wife and family are     
 here.                                 
 HAVE YOU SEEN ANY CHANGES IN THE AREA 
 IN THE LAST 40 YEARS?                 
 Yes there are more cars on the road   
 and the methods of farming are more   
 sophiscated.there are also more       
 machines used on the farm to ease the 
 burden of work for the farmer.        
 WHAT CHANGES WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE    
 TAKE PLACE IN THE AREA?               
 I think that the road network could be
 improved but I would not like to see  
 this area change.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
