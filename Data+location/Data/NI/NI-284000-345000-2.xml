		<content> The City of Armagh pre-dates          
 Canterbury as a Christian foundation. 
 Traditional history maintains that    
 Armagh was named Ard Macha or Macha's 
 Height after a legendary pagan queen  
 who built a fortress on the steepsided
 hill some 600 years before the        
 Christian era.Armagh itself went into 
 decline during the Emain Macha epoch  
 but returned to eminence in 300 A.D.  
 with the victory of the three Collas  
 over the Kingdom of Ulster.It was to  
 the hill of Armagh that St. Patrick   
 came during his mission.He persuaded  
 Daire,the local chieftain,to give him 
 the hill-top site on which he built   
 his cathedral in 445 A.D. Armagh still
 retains its status as a city by virtue
 of its cathedrals and by rights of    
 ancient usage.Churches,colleges and   
 schools developed around this site.
