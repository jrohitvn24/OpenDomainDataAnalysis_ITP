		<content> The stepped cliffs of limestone and   
 basalt which make up the headland are 
 among the foremost scenic attractions 
 of northern County Antrim, a particul-
 arly fine view being from Bally       
 castle across the bay. Linked to the  
 A2 road only by narrow lanes, the     
 small farms are exposed and poor,     
 keeping only a few cattle and sheep on
 the wet rough grazings. The fields are
 infested with rushes and boggy and are
 bounded by boulder and turf banks,    
 topped with rickety barbed wire       
 fences.                               
 The area is rich in historical sites  
 including an Iron Age fort (Doonmore) 
 and a crannog, or artificial lake     
 island, while a prehistoric tomb lies 
 on the western slope of Crockanore.   
 The eastern shore is a Nature Reserve 
 owned by the National Trust.
