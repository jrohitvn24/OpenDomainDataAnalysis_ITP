 The following pages contain           
 information on aspects of life in and 
 around the town of Newtownards. The   
 area covered is a town of about 25,000
 people ten miles east of Belfast and  
 at the head of Strangford Lough.  An  
 historic area which dates back to     
 prehistoric times the present town was
 founded at the beginning of the       
 seventeenth century and rebuilt in the
 eighteenth century. It expanded during
 the nineteenth century and became an  
 important hand loom weaving and market
 centre. Later many factories were     
 built but today many have closed and  
 the town has become a service centre  
 for the area and a dormitory town of  
 Belfast. The following pages deal with
 the area, its history, agriculture,   
 the life of the people, government and
 industry.                             </content>
