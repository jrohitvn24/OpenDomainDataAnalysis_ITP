		<title>17BELFAST ROYAL ACADEMY contd.</title>
		<content> The original site for the Academy was 
 not the present school on the         
 Cliftonville Road, but at what was    
 then the northern outskirts of        
 Belfast, behind St.Anne's Cathedral in
 Donegall St.  At that time York St.   
 didn't exist and the present Academy  
 St. was then called Linenhall Lane.   
   In 1878 the Academy acquired a site 
 for a new school on the "new          
 outskirts" at what is now the         
 Cliftonville Rd.  The first part of   
 the present school, an imitation      
 Scottish Baronial structure, was built
 with Permo-Triassic Sandstone from    
 Scrabo.  In the coming years the      
 Academy grew in both size and         
 reputation under a series of dedicated
 headmasters.  In 1887, Queen          
 Victoria's Jubilee Year, permission   
 was given for the school to change its
 name to Belfast Royal Academy.        </content>
