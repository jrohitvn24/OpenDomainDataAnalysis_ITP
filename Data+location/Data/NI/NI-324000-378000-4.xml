		<title>04AUGHNABRACK HOUSE</title>
		<content> The name Aughnabrack means{WOLF HILL.}
 It seems that the last wolf in Ireland
 was shot by a farmer who lived near   
 by.The wolf struggled down the hill   
 where it collapsed and died and that  
 is how Aughnabrack got its name.      
                                       
 Aughnabrack House is one of the       
 biggest farms in Ballyutoag. It was   
 built in the 18th century and the     
 present tenents have lived there since
 1920. No rebuilding has been done to  
 the house.It has two stories and      
 oil-fired central heating.            
                                       
 There are 2 workers on the farm to    
 look after 250 head of cattle. The    
 breeds are Charolais and Aberdeen. No 
 crops are grown on the farm.
