		<content> In our area some species of wildlife  
 are in danger because of pollution and
 farming methods.                      
 There is hardly a{corncrake}to be     
 heard. They have been killed by       
 combines and forage harvesters. Many  
{birds of prey}have been poisoned      
 through eating food that is polluted  
 by chemicals. People shoot birds for  
 fun, never thinking they are wiping   
 them out.                             
{Hedgehogs}and{stoats}are being killed 
 by road traffic as well as having     
 their hedges dug away by farmers who  
 are making fields larger.Some{insects}
 are also becoming scarce through      
 eating leaves sprayed with chemicals. 
 In 1985, a new Act of Parliament has  
 been passed to protect wildlife in    
 areas like ours.
