		<content>             DAN DOWNEY                
 The man that this story is about lives
 beside me.He is not married but he    
 lives with his sister who is called   
 Cissey.His name is Dan Downey and he  
 is an elderly man.Dan works very      
 hard.He ploughs,looks after his cattle
 and sheep,and is very kind to all his 
 neighbours.God has given him a special
 power which is to heal people.A lot of
 sick people come each day to ask for  
 his cure.He puts his hand on the      
 affected part and says some           
 prayers.People who believe in his     
 leading power are cured.I think he is 
 a very special person and I have seen 
 many people he has cured.
