		<content> The area known as the Ards Peninsula  
 is,as the name suggests, almost       
 completely surrounded by the sea.     
 This means that the region experiences
 very mild winters.Much of the region  
 is contoured by melted glaciers at the
 end of the ice age.The soil is light  
 and gravelly which makes it well      
 drained and poor as the result of rain
 washing fertilizer out and into the   
 sea.The main industry is concerned    
 with cattle,both beef and dairy.The   
 main dairy breed is called Friesian.  
 Beef breeds are many with new breeds  
 being introduced such as Simmental and
 Charolais.Crops grown are mostly in   
 support of this industry,eg.barley    
 maize for silage and recently rape.   
 Very little hay is made now as the    
 weather is unpredictable in spite of  
 sattelite forecasting.
