		<content> There is only one primary school in   
 the area and it is a small two-teacher
 school with 47 pupils.The school is   
 called{Evish Primary School}and all   
 the pupils are from the surrounding   
 area.There are only 2 rooms and 1 room
 has primary 1 to primary 3 and the    
 other has primary 4 to primary 7. The 
 teachers therefore have a number of   
 classes to teach at the same time.At  
 present many small schools like this  
 are threatened with closure.          
    Most of the local children attend  
 primary schools in nearby Strabane and
 most of these children,and those      
 attending Secondary School,travel by  
 buses of the local{Education Authority
 as there are no other bus services.
