		<title>13LANDSCAPE OF BANBRIDGE AREA</title>
		<content> The D-Block forms part of the         
 landscape of lowland Ulster, under 100
 metres in elevation. However, it is   
 far from flat,being dominated by      
 undulating drumlin country produced as
 the result of the last great Ice Age- 
 the Pleistocene.  The drumlins are low
 hummocky hills of glacial till        
 deposits occurring in swarms called a 
 "basket of eggs topography". They have
 been laid down underneath the ice     
 sheet as it advanced from the north.  
 Their slopes are well drained and     
 therefore ideal for agriculture       
 (square 1447) and settlement(square   
 1246),but in the hollows water        
 collects to give small streams and    
 poorer drainage with rushes (square   
 1346). Part of the southern and       
 western area is drained by the River  
 Bann, Northern Ireland's largest river
