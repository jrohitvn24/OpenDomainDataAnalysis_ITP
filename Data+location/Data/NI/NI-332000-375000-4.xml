		<content> At the end of every P7 year there is  
 a test called the 11+, which involves 
 Maths,English and Geography. It is a  
 test to see what school you go to     
 after primary school. Most people like
 English exams because they think they 
 are easy and Maths exams are hard.    
 That's why hardly anybody does this   
 exam.  In the exam G is a failure,M is
 a border line and A is a pass. When   
 you get an A it means you can go to   
 any school you want to. If you get a M
 you have a bit of choice which school 
 you want to go to, but if you get a G 
 then you simply go to the nearest     
 Secondary School. I didn't do the 11+,
 because I thought it would be too hard
 but Joanna did it because she thought 
 it was easy.  She got a G, and is     
 going to the Girl' Model.
