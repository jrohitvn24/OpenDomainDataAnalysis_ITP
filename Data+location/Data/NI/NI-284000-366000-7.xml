		<title>07CONFIRMATION DAY COALISLAND.</title>
		<content> My name is{Stephen Dorrity}and I was  
 confirmed in the{Church of the Holy   
{Family}on 3rd April 1984. I had       
 prepared for the day for many months. 
  Our teacher had practised the rite   
 with us for a number of weeks and the 
 priest had examined us on doctrine.   
 The worst part was being dragged      
 around the shops for new clothes. I   
 had to wear a suit, shirt and tie. The
 service was held at 3.00p.m. Iwas to  
 be confirmed by{Bishop Lennon}and was 
 very nervous particularly when I had  
 to go up yo the altar to be annointed 
 by the Bishop. The whole servive      
 lasted one and half hours. As soon as 
 it was over we all went outside and   
 had our photographs taken. It was a   
 bit like being lost in the jungle. I  
 then went home to be greeted by my    
 friends and relatived who gave me     
 money and presents.                   </content>
