     In our area the oldest  church is 
 Kilbride Parish Church. Its rector is 
{Reverend}Robert Cox.                  
                                       
     Kilbride Church was not  built  on
 the site of the  other church.  Parish
{Churches}started in the fifth century.
                                       
 It is built  facing  the  east  as the
 east lets in the sun while the service
 is  taking  place. The church is built
 in  shape   of   a   cross   and   the
 architecture   is   Gothic.  All   the
 stained  glass  has  been  put in over
 the last twenty years. It was  made by
 a man called Mailes from{Canterbury.  
                                       
                                       
     With  all the detailed statues and
 plaques , it   gives   the    church's
{ religion}a feeling of warmth.        </content>
