 FIFTH OF MAY 1969 BY PHELIM ROBERT

 COMPLETED BY THE 16th OF JUNE 1971    
 WHEN THE GOVERNER OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
 OPENED THIS CENTRE TO THE PUBLIC.THE  
 MUCH NEWER PART OF THE CENTRE,        
 HOWEVER, WAS NOT OPENED UNTIL THE 14th
 OCTOBER 1983 BY THE ALDERMAN SANDY    
 SPENCE,THE LORD MAYOR OF BALLYMENA.   
    SINCE THEN THE COMPLEX HAS
