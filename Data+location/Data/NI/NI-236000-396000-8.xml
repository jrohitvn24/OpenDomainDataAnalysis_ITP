 Wilson,President of the United States 
 from 1913 to 1921,is situated at      
{Dergalt,}about 2 kilometres from

 America in 1807.On the voyage  he met 
{Annie Adams}from nearby {Sion Mills}  
 and a year later,they were married.One
 of his two sons was the Rev.Joseph    
 Wilson who became the father of       
 Woodrow Wilson.The house itself is a  
 white_washed building with a thatched 
 roof.There are two floors and the     
 bedrooms are upstairs.The fire is an  
 open hearth, where all the cooking was
 done.Many{Ulster Scots}left Ulster in 
 the nineteenth century and sailed
