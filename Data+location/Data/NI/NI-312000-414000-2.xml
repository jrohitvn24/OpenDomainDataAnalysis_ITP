		<content>  {SITTING LOOKING OUT OF THE CLASS    
 ROOM WINDOW ON THIS BEAUTIFUL APRIL   
 MORNING{I SEE}A GREENESS COMING IN    
 THE FIELDS AND MOUNTAINS ALONG THE    
 HORIZON. THE BLACK HEDGES STILL MARK  
 OUR FIELDS.{ONLY THE TREES}THAT ARE   
 SHELTERED HAVE SIGNS OF LEAVES. THERE 
 ARE EWES AND NEW BORN LAMBS IN THE    
 FIELDS AND I GET{PLEASURE WATCHING THE
{SPORTING LAMBS.}THERE IS NO PLOUGHED  
 LAND IN ALL I CAN SEE. THE FIELDS ARE 
 TOO WET TO PLOUGH OR SOW MANURE.{AS I 
{COME NEARER THE SCHOOL}I CAN SEE THE  
 RIVER THE MAIN ROAD AND THE OLD       
 RAILWAY. THE ROAD IS{MOST BUSY}IN THE 
{MORNING AND THE EVENING}WITH PEOPLE   
 COMING AND GOING TO WORK IN{BALLYMENA 
 AND ON A SUNDAY WHEN PEOPLE GO TO THE 
 GLENS.{THE RAILWAY CLOSED IN 1934}AND 
 ALL THAT REMAINS NOW IS THE PILLARS OF
 THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER JUST        
 OPPOSITE THE SCHOOL                   </content>
