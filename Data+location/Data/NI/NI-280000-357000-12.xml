 300 000 cubic yards of cutting had to 
 be done.Many local people and firms   
 were given employment on the          
 construction.Fleets of lorries        
 conveyed{314 000 cubic yards}of       
 filling to the new road and many of   
 the approach roads suffered damage as 
 a result.                             
    The last section of the Motorway,  
 from{Birches to Portadown}was finished
 and opened in early{1968.}Ever since  
 the M1 has been kept very busy and has
 brought the western part of our       
 Province within easy reach of Belfast.
 Its construction has certainly been a 
 good investment.
