		<content> Houses were usually thatched and      
 consisted of two rooms and a kitchen. 
 The floor was either clay or          
 flagstone.A piece of timber was used  
 to sit on.People slept on a mattress  
 made of hay.If the person had any     
 animals,he would keep them in the     
 house with him.Their main source of   
 warmth was the hearth_fire.Water could
 be obtained from a near by well.      
 Today we can get different types of   
 houses.In this area one finds         
 bungalows or terraced houses.We obtain
 water from taps.Whereas 60 years ago  
 the main source of supply was from    
 spring wells.
