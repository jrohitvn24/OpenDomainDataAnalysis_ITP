		<title>14Landmarks - The Holestone</title>
		<content>     On  a rocky height in the townland
 of {Holestone }stands  a  large  stone
 which is a pagan monument.It is nearly
 2 metres  in  height  and  3 metres in
 circumference.About one metre from the
 ground  is   a  hole  large  enough to
 accomadate  a hand. This is thought to
 be a pagan{trysting }place  and such a
 place is deemed to be consecrated as a
 place  where  the   marraige  ceremony
 could  take   place. The   couple  are
 thought to have clasped  hands through
 the stone  and  so  solemnised   their
{marriage.                             
    In more modern times the place is a
 favourite haunt of courting couples.We
 like to think they feel the atmosphere
 from the  days  long  ago  and the old
{religion.                             
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
