		<content> BOAT CLUB, NEWTOWNABBEY               
 On the Carrickfergus side of the      
 Loughshore park, the premises of      
 Newtownabbey Boat Club are situated.  
 Like the Loughshore Park, this area   
 was formerly used as a rubbish-tip.   
 Sailing is obviously an important     
 recreational pursuit in the area and  
 the members of the club come not only 
 from the Newtownabbey area but from   
 places as far away as Mid-Ulster and  
 County Down.  The membership fee is   
 Â£30 per person per annum or Â£41 for a 
 family of 4.  If a member wishes to   
 store his boat at the club, then a    
 storage fee of 50 pence per foot is   
 charged.  At present there are 21     
 boats on the mooring and 100 boats on 
 site.  There are several different    
 types of boats in use at the club.    
 These range from simple rowing boats  
 to mirror sailing dinghies or         </content>
