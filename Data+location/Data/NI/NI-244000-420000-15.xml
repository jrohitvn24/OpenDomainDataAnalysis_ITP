		<title>15POPULATION IN CULMORE AREA</title>
		<content>      This region contains 3 main      
 housing estates;Shantallow which is   
 the largest in the S.W.area of the    
 block;Strathfoyle on the East bank of 
 the river;Ballynagard,a small estate  
 on the Western bank of the R.Foyle.The
 population per KMsq is high in these  
 areas,but in all other areas the      
 population density is low eg.         
 Ballyarnet which is mainly farmland   
 and Lisnahawley which is totally given
 over to industry.New developments     
 along the Culmore Rd.are attracting   
 young families whereas in general the 
 present residents of the area are     
 senior citizens with grown families.  
 The residents of the 3 estates,which  
 have been established over the past   
 20yrs,are families which were very    
 young when moved to the area and whose
 oldest child is now in his/hers late  
 teens.These are mostly working class. </content>
