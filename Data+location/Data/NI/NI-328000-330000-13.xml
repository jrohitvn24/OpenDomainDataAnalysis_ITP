 as Easter and during the Summer. The  
 local council has plans to put public 
 toilets at the car park.              
 The road through squares 6,9 and 8 is 
 a popular tourist route through the   
 Mourne Mountains although it is very  
 narrow in places. The T junction at   
 03380322 has been greatly improved and
 widened recently but all the other    
 roads in the area are bumpy and       
 narrow.                               
 The local bus service is very         
 infrequent and only works on Mon,Wed  
 and Fri in the Winter, two runs per   
 day.
