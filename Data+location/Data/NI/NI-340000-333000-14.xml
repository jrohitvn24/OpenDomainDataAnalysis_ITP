		<content> Apart from the obvious educational    
 value of the guided walks by the      
 Wardens, the Reserve also provides a  
 considerable number of topics for     
 study by school groups of Geography   
 and Biology students. Queen's         
 University of Belfast own Murlough    
 House and have fitted it out as a     
 Field Centre and Conference Centre.   
 They have built a Laboratory block and
 provided audio-visual facilities. The 
 major academic users of the Centre are
 the Civil Engineering students who    
 come onto the Reserve to learn        
 surveying (a somewhat pointless abuse 
 of a fragile environment when they    
 could learn as much in a bumpy        
 field!). Geography and Biology        
 students come to study the sand dune  
 environment.
