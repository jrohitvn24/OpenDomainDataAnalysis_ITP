 The old Culmore School was built in   
 1914. The bricks from the old jail in 
 Omagh were brought from the jail to   
 make a school that was then called    
 Cornabracken the site of which is just
 around the corner from our present    
 school which is in the process of     
 being extended.                       
 The subjects we study in our school   
 are English, Maths, History,          
 Geography, Religion, Needlework, P.E. 
 and Craft. We also have Netball for   
 girls and football for boys.  We have 
 over 370 children in our school and   
 this includes the Partially Hearing   
 Units for children that cannot hear   
 very well.                            
 School starts in the morning at 9.15  
 a.m.  Our first break is at 10.40 a.m.</content>
