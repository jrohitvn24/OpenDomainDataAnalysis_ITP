		<content> My father is a chemical engineer      
 stores supervisor. He keeps a record  
 of what is in the stores. He has a    
 secret password to get information out
 of the computer. He types information 
 into the computer about the chemicals 
 they have in the stores. My father    
 works from nine o'clock in the morning
 to five o'clock in the evening.       
   The firm that my father works for is
 called Montefibre. He has worked there
 for sixteen years. The factory        
 produces a man-made fibre called      
 Acrilan. There are about two hundred  
 people employed there altogether.     
   Acrilan is made in about thirty     
 colours. Some of the colours are      
 shocking-pink,baby-pink,dark          
 orange,fern-green,lemon and           
 royal-blue.
