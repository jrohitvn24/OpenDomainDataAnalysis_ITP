		<title>18RELIGION AROUND COALISLAND</title>
		<content> There is a Church of Ireland just     
 outside the block and a Methodist     
 Gospel Hall at Creenagh Bridge.       
    This distinct segregation of       
 catholics and Protestants in both     
 their residence and social life is    
 typical of N.Ireland in the 1980s.    
 Politics and religion go hand in hand 
 with Catholics voting Nationalist and 
 protestants voting loyalist.This      
 religious segregation is very evident 
 in local employment. Of the 5 small   
 local factories most of which have    
 government backing only a few         
 Protestants are found among the work  
 staff. These factories, two of which  
 is involved in building materials ,one
 a shirt factory and one a cavity wall 
 insulation and a glass works, are     
 local enterprises and each employ     
 between 10 and 60 people.
