		<title>14      Charms</title>
		<content>{ Charms}are passed from generation to 
 generation.They are passed from a     
 woman to a man, and then to a woman,  
 and then to a man and so on. If there 
 is no son or daughter it is given to a
 niece or nephew.                      
  {Mrs. Gibson of Moygashel}said that  
 she got her charms from her father    
 when she was a small girl. She got    
 them in a sealed envelope and didn't  
 open it until her father died. There  
 are lots of things to heal. Mrs.      
 Gibson heals{ringworm, warts,         
{toothache, bleeding, verrucas and     
{shingles.                             
    There are other things she can heal
 but I can't remember them all. Charms 
 fascinate me and it is still a mystery
 how they work. I do know that you must
 have{faith}in them if you are to be   
 cured.
