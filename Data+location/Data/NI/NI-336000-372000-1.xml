		<title>01The Education System</title>
		<content> In Northern Ireland our education     
 system is very old fashioned. When you
 are five you start primary school.    
 From P1 to P3 are really just infants 
 who play around and dont learn much.  
 When you enter P4 you get a real      
 shock. You hardly play at all and     
 start to learn a lot. When the years  
 pass by and you are in P7 you do your 
 first reasonably big exam_the 11+.You 
 do two exams about two months apart.  
 There are three grades _ A:a pass     
 M:in between  G:a fail. There are two 
 types of schools-grammar and          
 secondary.If you get an A you are     
 guaranteed a Grammar school place.    
 When you get an M it is quite likely  
 you will get into a grammar school. G 
 can only get in if he pays. When in   
 grammar or Secondary school you do    
 your 'O' levels and 'A' levels and if 
 you try you may get a university place</content>
