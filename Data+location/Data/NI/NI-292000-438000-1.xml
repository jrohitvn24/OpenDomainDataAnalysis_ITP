		<title>01 A General Description.</title>
		<content> This area covers the upper half of the
town of Bushmills and stretches across 
farm land to the neighbouring small    
settlements of Priestland and Billy.   
 The town of Bushmills, originally     
known as Portcamon grew up as a        
bridging point on the River Bush.  In  
the 17th Century the town and          
surrounding lands were granted to the  
MacNaughten family who have had a      
considerable influence on its          
development.                           
 Bushmills' present industries include 
a pyjama factory, a fishery and the    
world famous Bushmills Distillery.     
Also in the block are two water        
powered flour mills, disused           
since the 1950's.                      
 The surrounding land is primarily     
used for mixed farming, dairy farming  
predominant, barley the main cereal.   
The Scottish influence is still strong.</content>
