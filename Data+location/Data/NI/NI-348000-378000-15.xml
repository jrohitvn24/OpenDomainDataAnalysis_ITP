		<title>15CONSERVATION:CLANDEBOYE EST.</title>
		<content> Conservation was started in Clandeboye
 Estate when the rhododendron began to 
 take over and killed seedlings.       
 Conservationists were worried and     
 started to dig out the rhododendron by
 hand. They began to plant new trees.  
 They especially planted oak which is  
 native because it supports 300 species
 of insects. Deciduous woodland is     
 planted because it is scarce in       
 Northern Ireland,which is the least   
 wooded area in Europe. Also conserved 
 are deer,badgers,fox,otters and bird  
 life. For the future conservation can 
 be helped by leaving nettles,long     
 grass and shrubs like buddlia. Trees  
 can be planted and fruit and seed You 
 can stop dropping litter,not damage   
 trees or kill plants and spread the   
 word on so that other people will help
 wild-life.When older you can join the 
 Conservation Volunteers.    A.MORRISON</content>
