		<title>03 Where I go to school.</title>
		<content> When I come to Bushmills every morning
there are hardly any people about or   
any shops open.  It seems like a quiet 
place.  There is a community centre    
beside our school where discos are     
held at the weekends.  Behind the      
community centre is Bushmills Primary  
School where most of the children of   
Bushmills go.  As the day goes on the  
traffic soon builds up and quite a few 
people pass by the school.  Between    
classes sometimes you can smell the    
whiskey being made at the distillery   
and see the primary school children    
playing happily in the playground.     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
