		<title>16LIFE IN GRANGE PARK</title>
		<content> Grange park is situated about a half a
 mile from Ballygawley. There are      
 thirty two houses divided into groups 
 of four. Each end house has only two  
 bedrooms but a large kitchen while the
 two houses in between have three      
 bedrooms and a small kitchen. Each    
 house has a back and front garden.    
    One advantage of the park is that  
 it is very near St. Ciarans high      
 school but the disadvantage is that   
 the primary schools children have to  
 go into Ballygawley to school crossing
 the busy main Omagh to Ballygawley    
 road which is dangerous.              
    One major disadvantage is the lack 
 of playing facilities for the         
 children. They have to play out on the
 streets which can also be dangerous.
