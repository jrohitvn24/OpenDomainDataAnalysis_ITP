		<title>19How my Dad spends his Day</title>
		<content>{My dad is a farmer and gets up at     
{07.00 every morning.}After washing and
 dressing he goes outside to get       
 sticks, coal and blocks and comes back
 in and lights the big range.          
     {After breakfast he milks our goat
 and then puts her and her kid out to  
 graze in the field.{Then he starts to 
{feed the pigs which takes about three 
{hours.}Then it is time for lunch.     
     {After lunch he grinds barley and 
{mixes meal}which he takes to the pig  
 houses. Sometimes he has to take a sow
 over to the boar at one of our        
 neighbours, a short distance away.    
    { Early summer is his busiest time 
 of the year when he gets ready to     
 start the silage cutting. He has to   
 sharpen the forage harvester and to   
 put the sides on the trailers and     
 grease all the machinery.             
    Dad feeds the pigs again after tea.</content>
