		<title>12YESTERDAY</title>
		<content> Yesterday was Sunday 12th of May,1985.
 I got up at 8.30am.When I got dressed 
 I took my breakfast and went in the   
 car with Mum to Ballymacilroy Church. 
 When we came back we took a cup of    
 tea and at 1.30pm we were going out   
 for our dinner. We were going to the  
 "LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE" which is
 just outside Cookstown.We had to wait 
 for a while for there was a funeral   
 crowd having their dinner in the      
 place. It was Â£3.00 for children and  
 Â£5.00 for adults. That was counting   
 all your meals.It was a four course   
 meal. First of all we had soup,then we
 went up to a special table and picked 
 what we wanted for our main course.   
 Then we had dessert.We finished off   
 with coffee.                          
  I enjoyed yesterday very much.
