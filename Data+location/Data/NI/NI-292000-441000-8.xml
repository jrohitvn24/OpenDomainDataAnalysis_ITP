   The breeds of beef cattle are       
{Friesian Cross}and Simmental.In winter
 these animals eat silage ,barley and  
 meal and in summer grass.             
   When they are fully grown they are  
 sold to{Abbey Meat Packers,Belfast.   
   The dairy cattle are Friesians.Their
 milk is sent to Ballyrashane Creamery 
 where it is bottled.In winter the cows
 eat silage and in summer grass.       
   The young  calves these cows produce
