 MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE 1900   
 INCLUDING PEOPLE AND BUILDINGS. FOR   
 INSTANCE THE GARAGE USED TO BE A      
 BLACKSMITHS AND A DUSTY OLD ROOM USED 
 TO BE A COBBLERS. ALSO AN OLD HOUSE   
 DOWN THE  ROAD WAS A CREAMERY. DRUMARD
 SCHOOL,BUILT IN 1953,  WAS ONLY       
 SUPPOSED TO LAST A NUMBER OF YEARS IT 
 IS STILL HERE IN 1985! MRS. PORTER OUR
 SCHOOL COOK HAS LIVED IN OUR SQUARE   
 FOR 51 AND-A-HALF YEARS. SHE THINKS   
 HOUSING AND AGRICULTURE HAS IMPROVED  
 OVER THE YEARS. SHE VERY MUCH LIKES   
 WHERE SHE LIVES BECAUSE HER NEIGHBOURS
 ARE FRIENDLY.
