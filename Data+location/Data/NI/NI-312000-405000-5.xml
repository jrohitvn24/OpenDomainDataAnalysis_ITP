		<title>05THE CHICKEN HATCHERY</title>
		<content> 1 The chicken hatchery is situated on 
 the Broughshane Road halfway between  
 Ballymena and Broughshane.The hatchery
 is owned by{Mr.William O'Kane}who also
 owns a chicken factory on the Larne   
 Rd.Ballymena.                         
   There are about thirty people       
 employed at the Broughshane Road      
 Hatchery.This hatchery deals only with
 chicks.When the chicks are one day old
 they are checked to make sure they are
 healthy.Then they are sent to various 
 farms where they are reared until     
 seven weeks old.                      
   Next they are taken to the Larne    
 Road Factory where they are           
 killed,plucked,cleaned out and frozen.
   {In the future}Mr.O'Kane would like 
 to start a turkey factory at the back 
 of the chicken hatchery.
