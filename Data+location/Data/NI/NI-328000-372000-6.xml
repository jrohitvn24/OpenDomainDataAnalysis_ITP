		<content> My family have farmed in the{Whiterock
 area for over{100 years. }I remember a
 narrow tree lined Whiterock Road with 
 the City Cemetery on one side and     
 farmland on the other.  We engaged in 
{dairy farming}and also grew corn in   
 the fields which are now{Corrigan Park
 Football Grounds.  My father delivered
 milk using a{horse and cart.} The milk
 was kept in metal containers and      
 people came with jugs to be filled. It
 cost{1/2 pence per pint}and was       
 measured with a ladle.  The{Whiterock 
 estate was built in the 1920's and{St.
{John's Church}was built in 1928. {St. 
{Kevin's School}opened in 1933. In     
 their leisure time people played      
 cards, visited neighbours and attended
 Dramatic Societies. {Broadway Cinema  
 opened in 1936 and a seat cost 2      
 pence.  A bag of coal cost 13 pence   
 and a suit of clothes cost Â£2.50.{    </content>
