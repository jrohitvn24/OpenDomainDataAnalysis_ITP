		<content> Nestles is not the only industrial    
 centre in our area. We also have the  
 Gortrush Industrial Estate which has  
 twelve factories and is one of the    
 main working centres in Northern      
 Ireland. Once again it is just        
 situated off the Derry Road enabling  
 easy communication with the main      
 ports.                                
 Shergrims kitchens are modern and     
 fashionable.                          
 Cantrill and Cochrane, a mineral      
 manufacturer, have a depot in the     
 estate. They supply shops in the Omagh
 area with mineral.                    
 Securicor, a security company, are    
 based here.                           
 Finlay's engineering works, which     
 produce tractors and lorries, are also
 found on the estate.                  
 Rushe signs, a company which makes    
 shop signs are based here.            </content>
