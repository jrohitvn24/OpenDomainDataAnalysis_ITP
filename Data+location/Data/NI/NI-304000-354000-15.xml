		<title>15CHILDREN'S GAMES</title>
		<content> In 1985 girls played a game called    
 1.2.3 I AM FREE.You need more than    
 four people for this game.One person  
 is on it counts to 100 in ones slowly 
 while the rest go and hide.When the   
 person who is on it finishes counting 
 she goes and looks for the people who 
 are hiding. If a person hiding thinks 
 she can reach the post before the     
 person who is on it,she runs over,    
 touches the post,and calls out        
 "1.2.3 (the person's name) is not     
 free". But if the person who is on it 
  sees the person hiding or reaches the
 pole first and calls out "1.2.3(the   
 person's name) is not free", the game 
 goes on and when everyone is caught   
 or free the first person caught is on 
 it.                                   
{Stoner Runner}also consists of four or
