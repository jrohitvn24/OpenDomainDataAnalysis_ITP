		<title>13THE COUNCIL TIP _ CASTLE PK.</title>
		<content> On Tuesday June 11 we went to the     
 Bangor tip. We saw lots and lots of   
 rubbish and there was an old record   
 player. There was a man called Victor 
 who showed us around the yard. There  
 were two skips which were very big.   
 The opening hours were :_             
 08.00 _ 20.00 Monday to Friday        
 09.00 _ 18.00 Saturday and Sunday.    
 There was a horrible smell of rotten  
 fruit and I saw a rat nibbling an old 
 apple. There was a J.C.B. digger which
 piled all the rubbish on top. We      
 climbed on to the top of the skip and 
 Mrs.Mairs took photos of us. We found 
 out that all the rubbish went to      
 Rathgael Works Depot and got crushed. 
 A big machine crushed it and took it  
 to the shores of Belfast Lough. It    
 takes ten years to rot.
