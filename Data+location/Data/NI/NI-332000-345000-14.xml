		<title>14Guiness Primary School:Now.</title>
		<content>  The school is situated in the south  
 of the block.It caters for fifty-four 
 pupils at present,about two thirds of 
 which live within the block.Ages range
 from four to eleven years,after which 
 the children transfer to secondary    
 schools of their choice,depending on  
 their ability.There is a selection    
 procedure based on two written tests. 
  There are still only two classrooms, 
 and two teachers,both female.Primary  
 1-3 children are taught as one class, 
 with primary 4-7 making the other     
 class.Teaching methods are more       
 traditional than progressive,but they 
 have come a long way from the 1850's. 
  The school building however has      
 changed little.There are still outside
 toilets,and it was only in this       
 present year that "pot-belly"stoves   
 were replaced by electric central     
 heating.                              </content>
