		<title>13TRAFFIC SURVEY NEAR MOIRA</title>
		<content>                                       
 Being a rural area there are very few 
 forms of transport.The area is part of
 a bus route but the services are few. 
 The majority of the people own cars or
 landrovers.We surveyed three types of 
 road as to the volume of traffic.The  
 three roads were as follows: the      
 M1,the Moira road and the Dunygarton  
 road.Each survey lasted 15            
 minutes-from 1.15 to 1.30 on a        
 Thursday.The motorway was by far the  
 busiest with some 732 vehicles.The    
 Moira road would come next with 202   
 vehicles.The Dunygarton road is little
 more than a lane with only one tractor
 using it during the time.
