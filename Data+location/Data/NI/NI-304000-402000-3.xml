		<title>03A PIG FARM</title>
		<content>  Sam McKeown's pig farm, Moyasset, has
 one of the twenty accredited pedigree 
 pig herds in Northern Ireland. Mr.    
 McKeown breeds pedigree landrace and  
 all details of his thousand pigs are  
 kept on a computer by the Department  
 of Agriculture. Each pig has its      
 owner's name and an identification    
 number stamped on its ear.            
  Although the farm is primarily a     
 specialist pig farm, Mr McKeown also  
 keeps a herd of sixteen Charlois and  
 Simmental beef cattle on his sixteen  
 half acres of permanent grassland. The
 grassland takes up little of the      
 farmer's time as ploughing and        
 reseeding occur only ever seven or    
 eight years. His farm machinery       
 consists of a tractor, a hay machine  
 and a slurry tanker.
