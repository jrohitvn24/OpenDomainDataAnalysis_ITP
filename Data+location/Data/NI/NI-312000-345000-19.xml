		<title>19LAW &amp; ORDER IN BANBRIDGE</title>
		<content>      The responsibility for law and   
 order in Banbridge lies mainly with   
 the Royal Ulster Constabulary.  While 
 the police in Banbridge carry out the 
 same duties as their counterparts in  
 other parts of the U.K. they have     
 additional problems associated with   
 terrorist activities.  Because of this
 the police are assisted by the Ulster 
 Defence Regiment and the British Army.
  The police station in Banbridge is   
 heavily guarded and random road checks
 are carried out in an attempt to      
 prevent bomb attacks; only recently a 
 large bomb was detonated in the town  
 resulting not only in extensive damage
 to buildings but also in the death of 
 a young innocent by-stander.
