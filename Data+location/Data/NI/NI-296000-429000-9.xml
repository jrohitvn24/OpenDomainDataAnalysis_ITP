		<title>09BEEF FARMING, DERVOCK.</title>
		<content> In our block there are nine farms     
 involved with beef cattle, none of    
 which depends solely on beef farming  
 for income. The farmers all own their 
 farms which average about 75 acres.   
 In the summer months most of the      
 farmers make silage and hay which are 
 used for winter feeding, along with   
 concentrates and barley. On average   
 each farm has eighty cattle and the   
 main breed would be{Friesian.}Some    
 of the cattle are bought and sold at  
{Ballymoney Market,}others are sent to 
{Abbey Meats, Whiteabbey, Foyle Meats, 
{Londonderry,}or some other meat plant 
 to be killed and packed. Some farmers 
 rear their own cattle from calves,    
 others buy store cattle. The farmer   
 must look after his cattle well to    
 ensure that they will thrive and      
 increase in weight and therefore      
 produce a good quality meat.          </content>
