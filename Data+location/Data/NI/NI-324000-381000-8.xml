		<title>08THE LITTLE FOLK</title>
		<content> Roughfort is known for its fairies or 
 "Little Folk".You can see many fairy  
 thorns in the area,and the old people 
 have a great belief in the fairies and
 their powers.There was one man who    
 used to leave a bowl of meat outside  
 the door at night,and this was usually
 eaten,he believed it was eaten by the 
 fairies.                              
  The thorn bushes are not supposed to 
 be harmed in any way or {WOE BETIDE   
{ANY ONE WHO CUT ONE DOWN}.There was   
 once a farmer who did cut a thorn bush
 growing on a wall,and the next day one
 of his cows was grazing near the      
 wall,when the wall fell and killed    
 it.Fairies are not bad people,they may
 take milk from a cow in a field but   
 repay the farmer by blessing the crops
 in his fields.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
