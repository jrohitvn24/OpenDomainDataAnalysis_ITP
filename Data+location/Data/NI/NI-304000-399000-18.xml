		<content>{SCHOOL UNIFORM:_}At school we wear a  
 uniform.Girls would wear black shoes  
 or grey shoes, or if it was the winter
 time they wear wellington boots to    
 school with long knee socks.The boys  
 would wear black or grey trousers,grey
 or blue shirt and a navy and grey tie.
 As well as a jumper girls could wear a
 cardigan which has to be grey or      
 black.                                
{CLOTHES AT HOME:_}After we would come 
 home from school we would put on old  
 clothes like jeans and a jumper,or    
 shorts and tee_shirt,if it was a warm 
 day in the summer.                    
{LADIES FASHION:_}At the moment it is  
 fashionable to wear ski pants,which   
 are tight trousers with stirrup straps
 which go below your feet.On top you   
 could wear a bat wing sleeved jumper  
 with cowl neck.The colours now are    
 electric blue and burgundy.           </content>
