		<content> Most houses in our block are          
 farmhouses.The area is rural and there
 are a number of labourers cottages    
 dotted throughout the area.There is   
 one small group of a dozen terraced   
 bungalows which have been built to    
 house some of the off-spring from     
 the labourers cottages.There are too a
 limited number of new detached        
 bungalows which have been built mostly
 by landowners children now married but
 still working on their parents        
 farms.All the farmhouses and detached 
 bungalows are owner occupied whilst   
 the labourers cottages are owned by   
 the Housing Executive.A few cottages  
 have been bought and modernised by the
 occupier.The terraced bungalows are   
 also Housing Executive owned.The      
 farmhouses are all fairly old most    
 have been built over a century ago.The
 other mentioned are about 30 years old</content>
