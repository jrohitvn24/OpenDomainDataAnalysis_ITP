     The  bus  service  in the{Kilbride
 area is mainly  run  by the {Ulsterbus
 company  which  is  the   largest  bus
 company in  Northern Ireland.  All the
 buses  that  are  used  to service the
 Kilbride  area  all   work   from  the
 Ballyclare Ulsterbus Depot.           
                                       
                                       
   As  Kilbride  is  mainly  a  farming
 area  the  people in that  area do not
 need as  much {transport}as they would
 in a  big town.  Eight buses are used.
                                       
   The  main  use of the bus{service}is
 taking the children to and from school
 in Ballyclare.                        
                                       
   Without  a  bus  service it would be
 hard  to  get to  one  place and  back
 without a car.                        </content>
