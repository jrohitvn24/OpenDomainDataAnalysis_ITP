		<title>18  Games Children Play ctd.</title>
		<content> There are 11 players on each side,    
 each one with a different position.   
 There is a goalkeeper,two defenders,  
 three in mid-field and five forwards. 
   Another game we play is{'hide and   
{seek'.}One person counts to one       
 hundred and lets the rest go and hide.
 When he or she has counted to one     
 hundred he goes to find them. The     
 first one found has to help him to    
 find the others. When they are all    
 found a new game begins, the first one
 found being the new searcher.         
   Other games we play are{'hit below  
{the knee', rounders, netball and      
{skittle ball.                         
   In 1985, you see, we are never short
 of a game to play.
