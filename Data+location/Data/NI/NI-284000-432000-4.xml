		<content> The learning needs of the children and
 adults of Coleraine are well catered  
 for in the provision of schools and   
 further education centres.There are   
 two primary schools on the West bank  
 of the River Bann,Killowen and the    
 D.H.Christie Memorial.On the East bank
 are St.Malachy's and Milburn in the   
 town area,and in the suburbs,to       
 provide for the large housing estates,
 are Harpur's Hill and Ballysally.     
  {Ballysally,}which is our own        
 school,is the most recently built. It 
 is well designed and equipped for     
 three hundred boys and girls.It was   
 opened by Dr.Humfreys in 1978.        
  There is a special unit to provide   
 specialised help and teaching for     
 disabled children.In September a new  
 unit is to open for older children    
 with special needs.
