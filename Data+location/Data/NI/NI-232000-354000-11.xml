		<content>Trillick is situated on the (B.46) road
between Omagh and Enniskillen which    
means that there is a large volume of  
through traffic daily.                 
Trillick is fourteen miles south-west  
of Omagh,and eleven miles North-East   
of Enniskillen, the two neighbouring   
county towns. Many of the Trillick     
residents who have found work in Omagh 
and Enniskillen travel by car to these 
centres.                               
Trillick has no rail links with the    
rest of the province but Ulsterbus     
provides a daily bus service           
connecting Trillick and Omagh in the   
morning and evening. There is also a   
regular weekly midday bus service.     
Trillick and Enniskillen are also      
linked by Ulsterbus. In addition,      
school bus services are provided.      
Trillick is the main tourist route     
from Co. Tyrone to Fermanagh Lakeland. </content>
