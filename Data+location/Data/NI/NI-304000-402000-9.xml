		<title>09THE RIDING SCHOOL</title>
		<content>  Every Thursday morning at about      
 9.45am the Community Police Bus took 5
 girls from our school to a farm       
 between Galgorm and Cullybackey where 
 there is a Riding School.             
  The girls worked there until 11am    
 leading the horses and ponies round   
 the barn. They where needed because   
 the riders where disabled and many of 
 them found it difficult to stay on the
 horses. The children where all        
 physically and mentally handicaped and
 at the riding school were being helped
 to cope with their disabilities. Horse
 riding is also used as a therapy to   
 help improve their condition.         
  The girls from our school learned    
 a lot from this experience and really 
 enjoyed doing the work although it was
 often difficult. At the end of term   
 there was a party and the helpers were
 invited. Everyone had a great time.   </content>
