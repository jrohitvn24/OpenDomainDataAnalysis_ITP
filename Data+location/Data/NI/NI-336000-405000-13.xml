		<title>13DAIRY FARM _ BROADFORD</title>
		<content> Farmer Murray, who lives on Old       
 Glenarm Road, rises at 6.30 to milk   
 his {70 black and white Friesan cattle
 12 cows fit onto the machine at one   
 time. It is quite a modern milking    
 parlour, though some farms now have { 
{computerised machines.}Mr Murray      
 hasn't hand_milked since 1955.The cows
 eat concentrates to encourage them as 
 their {milk is pumped into a cooling  
{tank.The 1450 litres}are pumped into a
 road_tanker,which takes it to{Deerpark
{Creamery.}The cattle are milked again 
 at 6pm. Mr Murray is busy during      
 summer {cutting silage}which will be  
 stored for winter feed. From May the  
 cattle{live outside}on grass + 2 kg of
 dairy nuts per day,while from October{
{they are fed inside}on silage and 7kg 
 of dairy nuts per day. Continual rain 
 has hindered silage cutting this year,
 the worst year since 1960.            </content>
