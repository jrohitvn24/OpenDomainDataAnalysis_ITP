		<title>18WEEKEND IN SAINTFIELD</title>
		<content> Last Saturday my family went to our   
 granny's house by car.My daddy went to
 get some wood for the fire.Our granny 
 made us some tea and biscuits.My daddy
 played football in the back garden    
 with me.When we arrived home we       
 had to be quiet because my mummy works
 all night and sleeps until the evening
 of the next day.When I got home I went
 out and played with my friends over   
 the fields.On Sunday we went to       
 Ardglass for some fish for our        
 tea.There were lots of boats.I watched
 people fishing.I also saw a big crab  
 crawling on the sea bed.When we got   
 home my daddy dug some of the garden.I
 went bird watching.I saw              
 laplings,chaffinches and a kestrel and
 I found the nest of a bullfinch.
