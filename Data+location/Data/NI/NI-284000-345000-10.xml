		<title>10THE ARTS: A NEW THEATRE?</title>
		<content> After the City Hall,which housed both 
{auditorium}and offices,was destroyed  
 by a bomb in the early 1970's,the     
 local council decided to purchase the 
{Primate's Palace}for office           
 accommodation thereby leaving Armagh  
 without its civic auditorium. In      
 February 1978 the Arts Committee began
 to campaign for the provision of an   
 auditorium. Later that year the       
 District Council identified the need  
 for such an auditorium;for various    
 reasons that sale was never completed 
 the committee's agitation continued in
 the early 1980s. In 1982 the council  
 announced plans to build a{recreation 
{centre}at Armagh swimming pool with   
 aid of an{E.E.C. grant.}The Art       
 committee objected on the grounds of  
 location and suitability. In 1983 the 
 council{agreed in principle}to a new  
 auditorium, funds permitting.         </content>
