		<content>{Larne Drama Circle is one of the      
 foremost amateur drama companies in   
 the North of Ireland.                 
 Formed in 1949, its home is in the    
 Carnegie Arts Centre in Victoria Road,
 and it uses the Victoria Hall in      
 Curran Road for public productions.   
 It has a current membership of seventy
 persons, and from September until     
 February each year a programme of     
 readings, workshop sessions and visits
 from other clubs is carried out.      
 Thursday is club night, but for most  
 evenings during the season, rehearsals
 are taking place in the clubroom.     
 Two productions are usually mounted   
 each year, and these will attract a   
 support of up to one thousand         
 patrons.
