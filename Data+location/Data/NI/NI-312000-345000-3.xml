		<title>03TRANSPORT IN BANBRIDGE</title>
		<content> The quality of road provision in the  
 area varies greatly.From all          
 directions except Dromore and Newry,  
 the roads are of poor quality.The     
 town itself is ringed on the A1 by a  
 by-pass which,for financial reasons   
 has been reduced to a single carriage-
 way and is consequently regarded as   
 dangerous.Roads are the only form of  
 surface transport from the town,which 
 stands on a strategic crossing point  
 on the River Bann.In 1956,the         
 popularity of the motor car and road  
 freight transport saw to the demise of
 the railway service in the town.The   
 town enjoys quick access to the main  
 ports of Belfast and Larne,while      
 Belfast International Airport can be  
 reached in 3/4 hour.The prosperity of 
 the town is reflected in the level of 
 car ownership,considerably higher than
 the national average.                 </content>
