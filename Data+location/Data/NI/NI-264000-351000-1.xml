		<title>01A General View of Aughnacloy</title>
		<content> Although no record is to be found     
 giving exact details as to how        
 Aughnacloy began,it is probable that  
 it grew up near{Sir Thomas Ridgeway's}
 bawn at the time of the plantation.   
 Aughnacloy and Derrycush were         
 adjoining townlands but as the        
 place grew the name Aughnacloy was    
 applied to the town and Derrycush to  
 the townland.Now Aughnacloy is        
 situated in the Parish of             
 Carnteel.With around 800 residents the
 town provides basic shopping          
 facilities for the surrounding        
 district.Its exceptionally wide street
 providing more than adequate parking. 
 Many of the older houses in the town  
 and district have had complete        
 overhauls,thanks in many instances to 
 generous improvement grants given by  
 the Northern Ireland Housing          
 Executive.                            </content>
