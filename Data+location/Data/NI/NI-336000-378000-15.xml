		<title>15THE OLD PRIORY CHURCH/3</title>
		<content> In the early seventeenth century three
 round-headed windows were opened in   
 the south wall but these were blocked 
 up following the abandonment of the   
 building in 1844.                     
                                       
 The small tower with its square base  
 and octagonal upper stage, topped by  
 rather striking pinnacles was added   
 about 1800.                           
                                       
 A fine wedge-shaped stone "coffin" lid
 of Anglo-Norman date was dug up in the
 graveyard in 1879, and nearby several 
 corbels in the form of carved masks   
 were also discovered.  They were all  
 built into the South wall of the      
 church for safe-keeping, however,     
 weathering has made it necessary to   
 move them indoors.                    
                                       
                                       </content>
