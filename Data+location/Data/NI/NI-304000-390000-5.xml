		<content> Dear Mr. French,                      
                                       
 You will recall the concern shared by 
 us all when it was learned that the   
 lower Craigmore Quarry was being      
 considered as a site for a Council    
 Refuse Tip.                           
                                       
 Out of our concern grew a             
 determination to fight this           
 application and accordingly a         
 Solicitor - Mr. Ballentine and Junior 
 Counsel - Mr. Alister were employed by
 us to present our case at the Public  
 Inquiry at Antrim.  Monies were raised
 for this purpose and a total of       
 Â£1,486.00 was collected.  Our costs,  
 which have been paid, were Â£1,008.50 -
 Â£1,000 for the solicitor and junior   
 counsel and Â£8.50 for a specially     
 required film, obtained by Mr. David  
 French.                               </content>
