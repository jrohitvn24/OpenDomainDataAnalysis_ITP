		<title>18Tourism in Drumaroad area</title>
		<content> Relatives of families in our block    
 return as summer visitors for peace   
 and beauty in the countryside around. 
 Each drumlin crest is crowned by a    
{fort}or ancient farm-stead.The most   
 famous is the{White Fort,}situated 200
 metres north of{Drumaroad village.}On 
 the site is the grass-covered remains 
 of a 4-poster dwelling which was 30ft.
 in width and 17ft.high. The{geographer
 would be interested in the hornfelsed 
 silurian{country-rock}within Slieve   
 Croob's aureole. Magnificent views of 
 the{Mourne Mountains}are available on 
 any hilltop.Pleasant walks could lead 
 to a perusal of the many cottage ruins
 from the last century.{Shanbally}is an
 old{village}of such homesteads in the 
 townland of Drumanaghan.A number of   
 wells which were the only water supply
 are evident close to the dwellings.Our
 block is close to many sandy{beaches. </content>
