		<title>09PUBLIC TRANSPORT, DUNGANNON</title>
		<content>                                       
 The only major form of public         
 transport in this area is the Bus     
 Service run by the state owned        
 Ulsterbus company.It is part of a     
 province wide network which links all 
 of the major towns, while also        
 providing a local service for the     
 community in and around Dugannon. In  
 former times Dugannon was linked with 
 the cities of Derry, Belfast and      
 Dublin by railway.However this line   
 was closed down during 1963 as part of
 a general pruning of railway services 
 in Britain. It was thought at the time
 that these closures would save the    
 Government money. One factor which may
 have influenced the decision to close 
 the Dungannon line was the completion,
  at this time, of the M.1. motorway   
 linking Belfast and Dungannon.
