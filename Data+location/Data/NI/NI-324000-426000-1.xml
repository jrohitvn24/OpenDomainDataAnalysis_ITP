		<content> The open foreland inshore from        
 Cushendall Bay, sheltered from the    
 westerly winds by the mountains       
 inland, has a calm serenity that makes
 it ideal as a tourist and holiday     
 resort, albeit on a small scale. The  
 suburban coastal fringe of the town   
 retains an unspoiled semi rural       
 character, with residential           
 developments kept away from the main  
 coast road to Glenariff to the south. 
 Nevertheless the demand for caravan   
 parking space near the modern marina  
 and sailing club facilities could     
 endanger those restful conditions.    
 North of the town centre the cliffed  
 coast, part of which is managed by the
 National Trust, offers variety of     
 outlook, as does the view south beyond
 Glenariff and Red Bay. The only       
 industry is, appropriately, a small   
 boatyard near the marina.             </content>
