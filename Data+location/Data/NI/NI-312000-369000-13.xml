		<content>    The 150 pupils at Ballymacrickett  
 P.S. encounter a wide variety of      
 subjects. The school is Catholic and  
 religion plays an important part in   
 the formation of religious and moral  
 values. In the present troubled times 
 a positive effort is made to bridge   
 the gap between religious groupings.  
    English and Maths are recognised as
 priority subjects: History,Geography, 
 Science, Music, Art, Craft,           
 Needlecraft and P.E. are all on the   
 curriculum with varying attainment,   
 and French is introduced in the final 
 year.                                 
    A B.B.C. Micro is used despite the 
 paucity of good programmes for        
 Primary. School trips to Armagh       
 Planetarium, Ulster Folk Museum,      
 ballet and pantomime have been this   
 year's crop.
