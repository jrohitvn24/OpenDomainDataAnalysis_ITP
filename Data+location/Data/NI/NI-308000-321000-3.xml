		<content> Although this is mainly a rural area, 
 the majority of the people don't make 
 a living from the land because of its 
 infertile, hilly nature.  However,    
 there are 3 dairy farms, 2 chicken    
 farms and one pig farm which are all  
 primarily family concerns absorbing no
 local labour.  The population consists
 mainly of young professional married  
 couples who find employment in the    
 adjoining towns of Newry and          
 Warrenpoint.  Generally speaking, due 
 to the fact that these are young      
 couples with families of school age,  
 there is little youth unemployment or 
 indeed  unemployment as a whole.      
 This however is not indicative of the 
 general situation throughout the rest 
 of the country.  Apart from the       
 self-employed and the professionals   
 there are some retired people living  
 in the district.                      </content>
