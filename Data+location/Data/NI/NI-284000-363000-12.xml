		<content> Many have their own snooker tables in 
 their homes while some go to the local
 snooker hall in Coalisland, or the    
 older men have lots of opportunity to 
 play POOL with tables provided in the 
 local pubs.                           
      There is a strong tradition of   
 GREYHOUND breeding and racing in this 
 area. We have a local DOG-TRACK which 
 is used on Sundays for races and      
 trials. Many local greyhound owners   
 race their dogs in Belfast, Lifford   
 and Derry and many have bred champion 
 dogs worth a few thousand pounds.     
      Fishing for TROUT and SALMON by  
 line is a popular sport among boys and
 men with a number of small rivers     
 running through the area. Hunting for 
 RABBITS, FOWL and FOXES using FERRETS 
 or a GUN and DOG is another popular   
 pastime.
