		<title>17Larne Drama Festival</title>
		<content> Larne Drama Festival has been held for
 forty four years, and its current home
 is in the Victoria Hall which is quite
 close to the Olderfleet School.       
 The Festival takes place in March each
 year. In 1985 seven amateur companies 
 each staged a full length play. The   
 companies were from Ballymoney,       
 Belfast, Ballymena, Newtownabbey and  
 Omagh.                                
 The programme included 'Da' by Hugh   
 Leonard, 'Macbeth' by William         
 Shakespeare, 'Who's Afraid of         
 Virginia Woolf?' by Edward Albee and  
 'The Faith Healer' by Brian Friel.    
 Each evening, after the performance,  
 a public adjudication is given. This  
 year the adjudicator was Patrick      
 Sandford, artistic  director of the   
 Lyric Theatre in Belfast.
