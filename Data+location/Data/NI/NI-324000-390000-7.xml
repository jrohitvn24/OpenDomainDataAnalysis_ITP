     Many    newly    built     houses 
 especially detached {bungalows  }have 
 been built or are  in the proccess of 
 being  built.  As    well   as    the 
 traditional two story  detached  farm 
 houses, private  residences   are now 
 dotting the {countryside  }commanding 
 views  as  far  away as Cave  Hill in 
 Belfast  to south and Lough  Neagh to 
 the west.                             
                                       
      This area was originally  a{green
{belt }but   this  has  been  abolished
 resulting  in  a  rush   of    current
 building.New{housing}has become a boom
 industry in this area.
