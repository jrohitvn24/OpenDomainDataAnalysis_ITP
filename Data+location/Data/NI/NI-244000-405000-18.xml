		<title>18Glenagoorland mill</title>
		<content> In our area there is an old mill which
 was once used to scutch flax.The      
 turbine was driven by water.There were
 two dams,one big one to collect the   
 water and one as a feeder dam.        
  The stuff that came of the flax when 
 it was scutched was called shous.     
 People around the district used shous 
 to put on their fire.Usually on a     
 Monday my Granda took the flax into   
 Strabane in his lorry.Everybody who   
 wanted to get their flax scutched     
 came there together with their flax.  
 In 1850 or before it the old mill     
 was a corn mill.I don'tknow when it   
 changed to a flax mill.The old mill is
 over one hundred and fifty years old. 
  Now the old mill is used for keeping 
 machinery in it.
