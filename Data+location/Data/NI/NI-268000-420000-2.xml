		<content> At the centre of our rectangle is     
 Ardmore Lodge, which belongs to       
 Patrick Macrory who was knighted for  
 his work in reorganising local        
 government in Northern Ireland.  The  
 house was built by his great          
 grandfather, Robert, in 1822, who     
 founded the famous Macrory flour      
 mills.  The original building was a   
 simple Ulster farmhouse, which was    
 extended over the years.  However,    
 because of the lay of the land Robert 
 could only build on at each end,      
 resulting today in a house that is    
 about 70 metres long but only one room
 wide.  The thick walls of the first   
 farmhouse are still obvious, as is the
 outline of the ladder stairway that   
 led to the upstairs room.
