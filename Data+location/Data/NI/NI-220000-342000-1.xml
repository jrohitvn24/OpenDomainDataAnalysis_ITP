		<content>       This block covers most of {     
{ENNISKILLEN}the county town of        
 Co.Fermanagh.An island,on the {       
{River Erne,}this was a castle site    
 before the Plantation of Ulster when  
 the town was established.Being an     
 island was an advantage then, but now 
 it leads to problems,particularly of  
 traffic.The town has now expanded well
 beyond the island site and much of the
 rural landscape has been built upon.  
       The rural area is mostly devoted
 to dairy farming,with some beef.      
       Tourism is one of the main      
 attractions of the area,and one which 
 is becoming more important as time    
 passes.{Fishing}is a major tourist    
 attraction,as the{LAKELAND COUNTY}is  
 being promoted to attract fishermen   
 from all over the world.
