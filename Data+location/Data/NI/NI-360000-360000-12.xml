		<title>12FARMING  (part 1)</title>
		<content>  The Ards Peninsula has the highest   
 incidence of windmills anywhere in    
 Ireland. Ofcourse these are no longer 
 used, but last century arable farming 
 was the main type of farming carried  
 on in the Ards. The fertile soil, free
 drainage and mild climate were ideal  
 conditions. Today only 5% of the land 
 in this survey is used for growing    
 barley, which is then used to         
 supplement feed concentrates during   
 the winter months. The straw is as    
 necessary than the actual barley.     
   The Echlin family who owned the     
 largest estate in this area won a     
 prize from the Dublin Agricultural    
 Society for sowing 100 acres of barley
 on reclaimed moss; it proved to be the
 largest return produced by any        
 individual thoughout the U.K. in a    
 single year. Market conditions have   
 produced a complete swing to DAIRYING.</content>
