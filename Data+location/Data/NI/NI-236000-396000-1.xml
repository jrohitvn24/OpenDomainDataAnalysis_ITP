		<content> The area lies to the east of{STRABANE.
 It is mainly upland with a line of    
 hills running from NORTH-WEST to      
 SOUTH-WEST.In the NORTH-WEST is the   
 highest mountain which is{KNOCKAVOE.  
 It rises to just over 3OO metres.Then 
 to the East are{CRAIGNAGORE}(just     
 below 3OOm) and{EVISH}(25Om).         
  The upper slopes of the hills are    
 covered by extensive sombre coloured  
 moorlands, given over to sheep. To the
 north and south land use changes as   
 height decreases.Firstly there is     
 enclosed rough grazing  and on the    
 lowland and intensively managed       
 grassland.Population distribution is  
 very sparse and it consists mainly of 
 dispersed farms.There are a number of 
 old and deserted farmhouses showing   
 that the area has lost population over
 the years.
