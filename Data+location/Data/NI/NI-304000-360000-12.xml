  The Water Works are situated at      
 Castor Bay,on the shores of Lough     
 Neagh,near Lurgan.The first Water     
 Works were built here in 1894,but an  
 extensive new plant was built in 1971.
  About 14.5 million gallons of water  
 are taken from Lough Neagh each       
 day.This is filtered twice,firstly    
 through rough sand and then through   
 fine sand.It is then mixed with sodium
 bicarbonate and chlorine for final    
 purification.                         
  There is a reservoir in the Water    
 Works which stores about 4 million    
 gallons for local use.The rest is     
 piped to reservoirs at Ballydugan and 
 Magheraliskmisk.                      
  The Works are run by a staff of      
 eleven.                               
  On the site of the Water Works is an 
 ancient Celtic motte.                 </content>
