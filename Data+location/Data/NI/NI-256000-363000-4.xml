		<title>04SAND AND GRAVEL QUARRYING</title>
		<content> Mullins' Quarry supplies the Building 
 Trade with sand, gravel and concrete  
 products,in particular bulk readymade 
 concrete.{Four brothers are actively  
{involved in this thriving business    
{which presently employs about 30.}One 
 of those four brothers is my father.  
   When my father was a young boy there
 was no Mullins' Quarry, no machinery, 
 no lorries or sandwashing plant;{there
{was just a hole in the hill called a  
{sandpit,}where the local farmers used 
 to come with horse and cart to get    
 sand. They dug the sand out with      
 shovels.This was called 'rising sand'.
 He remembers the farmers saying to my 
 Grandfather,"I must go to the pit and 
 rise some sand."My Grandfather started
 making concrete blocks as his family  
 grew up to help him,and in the late   
 50's they decided to go into business 
 in a bigger way to meet demand.       </content>
