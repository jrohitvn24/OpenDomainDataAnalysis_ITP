		<content>   Mr.M.,a local farmer, keeps Jacob's 
 sheep and Highland cattle,both very   
 rare,as a hobby.He keeps 43 Jacob's   
 sheep.This sheep has four horns,two on
 the top and one on each side of its   
 head:sheep without horns are very     
 rare,and Mr.M.has two.The Jacob's     
 sheep are mentioned in the Bible:Jacob
 was given speckled sheep by his       
 father-in-law.                        
   The sheep have 1-3 lambs which are  
 usually black and white,but as they   
 grow older,their coats grow longer,the
 black speckles turn to brown,and the  
 wool turns from white to cream.They   
 develop slower than modern sheep,but  
 are more resistant to disease and     
 pests.The wool is of good quality and 
 is used to make all sorts of items,   
 including hats and mats.The horns are 
 also used to make things like buttons 
 and walking-stick handles.            </content>
