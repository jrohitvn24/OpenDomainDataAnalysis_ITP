		<content>{     }In 1983 the remains of a {      
{SOUTERRAIN }was discovered in our     
 area. This souterrain possibly dated  
 back to the {5th CENTURY AD.}This     
 discovery was made by workmen         
 levelling a field near the rectory    
 when the excavator sank into a hole,  
 and this proved to be the entrance to 
 the souterrain.                       
       Thousands of years ago people   
 built earth forts or raths as they    
 were called. They lived there and they
 protected them from their emimies.    
 Usually they had underground passages 
 called souterrain, cut into clay and  
 lined with tightly _ packed stone, in 
 which they kept their valuables or    
 food or more importantly to hide in   
 when danger threatened.
