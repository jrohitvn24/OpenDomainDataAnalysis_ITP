		<title>13INDUSTRY IN CULMORE AREA</title>
		<content>      The main industry in our area is 
 centralized in the Maydown Industrial 
 Estate ie.centered in the N.E. of our 
 block and 5 miles outside Derry.      
 Included in this estate are Coolkeragh
 power station,the Neoprene factory of 
 Du Pont,British Oxygen,a yarn factory,
 Ulster fertilizers,Foyle meats and the
 former Courtaulds factory.The estate  
 covers an area of 120acres.The power  
 station supplies energy to Derry and  
 the surrounding areas.It was          
 established in 1960 but is due to     
 close down in 1990 because of the     
 excessive demand for electricity which
 it is unable to cope with.Du Pont has 
 been in operaton for 25yrs and is a   
 major source of employment to the     
 area.It was established there due to  
 the advantages of a flat site, good   
 water supply,good communications  esp.
 its location on a deep water esturary.</content>
