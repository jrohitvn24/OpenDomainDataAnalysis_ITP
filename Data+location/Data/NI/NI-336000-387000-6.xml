		<content> The reservoirs have to be checked     
 daily for water  levels, depth        
 soundings have to be taken regularly  
 on the dam banks to make sure there is
 no leakage.  At different locations on
 the water courses there are iron grids
 fitted so that at a time of flooding, 
 branches of trees, leaves and debris  
 are trapped and can be cleared away.  
 Also, if flooding occurs the water can
 be directed straight into the Woodburn
 river.                                
      At different intervals silt which
 washes into the water courses from the
 streams and rivers has to be cleaned  
 out, briars and grass need to be cut  
 back.   The water is treated and      
 filtered by micro-strainers before    
 being fed to Belfast at a rate of     
 eight million gallons per day.   At   
 present in 1985 the work force is     
 eleven men.                           </content>
