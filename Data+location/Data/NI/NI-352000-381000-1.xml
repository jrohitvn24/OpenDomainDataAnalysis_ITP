		<title>01GEOGRAPHY of GROOMSPORT</title>
		<content> This area lies between Bangor and     
 Groomsport and is mainly rural.The    
 population is concentrated along the  
 coast in the two settlements mentioned
 with only a few isolated farms inland.
    The coast is fairly rugged and some
 islands are found off the chief       
 headlands.At Ballymacormick Point the 
 National Trust have taken over a large
 area of rough grazing.A coastal path  
 goes through this.                    
    The farmland is nearly all         
 grassland used for pasture or hay.Some
 potatoes are grown and some cereal    
 crops.This is because of the low      
 relief (few hills over 13 metres      
 high),moist climate and clay soils.   
    Groomsport was once a small fishing
 village but now has a population of   
 4000.It caters for tourists in the    
 summer and has two large caravan      
 sites.                                </content>
