		<title>18I Like Hillsborough</title>
		<content>{My name is David. I am eleven years   
{old and I have lived in Hillsborough  
{since I was six.}It is the prettiest  
 village I have ever seen. The people  
 are very friendly and always have     
 happy faces.{Even the birds smile!    
     My mum likes Hillsborough because 
 it is convenient to the motorway which
 takes you straight to Belfast or      
 Dungannon.                            
    {The village is clean}and has very 
 fresh air all around it. It has good  
 shopping facilities.                  
    {Older people come to live in      
{Hillsborough as it is a big village   
{with an even bigger heart.            
     The village has two beautiful     
 churches:- The Parish Church with it's
 lovely tall spire and the             
 Presbyterian.                         
     I hope I will always live in the  
 village of Hillsborough.              </content>
