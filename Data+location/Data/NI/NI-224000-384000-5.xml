		<content> Castlederg provides a wide range of   
 entertainment for all ages of people. 
 For the young there are disco's ,     
 youth clubs and the occasional dance. 
 Disco's take place in Saint Patrick's 
 Hall and in the Orange Hall.          
 Sometimes they are held in St Eugene's
 Secondary School and the Controlled   
 School.  Many teenagers travel to     
 frequently across the border to       
 Ballybofey and to Castlefin to attend 
 dances. The Butt Hall in Ballybofey   
 and the Border Inn in Castlefin are   
 popular venues.  Others travel to     
 Omagh to dances in the G.A.A and      
 Knocknamoe Hotel.  Country and West_  
 ern bands are less popular with young 
 people who now prefer pop music.      
 Ceili music is still poplular with    
 many people, especially the older     
 group.
