		<content>{The Antrim Coast Road}is one of the   
 most famous roads in Ireland.It begins
 at{Blackcave Arch}in Larne and winds  
 round the shore to{Ballycastle}passing
 through the beautiful villages of {   
{Glenarm,Carnlough,Waterfoot,Cushendall
{and Cushendun.}It was built between   
 1832 and 1842 by local men with a Scot
{William Bald}in charge.It was once    
 said to be built to give work to the  
 Irish during the 1845 Famine ,but the 
 road was finished then.A more likely  
 reason was that soldiers could travel 
 quickly to trouble spots in the {Glens
{of Antrim.}Tourists from all over the 
 world travel this road to see the     
 beautiful scenery{the black basalt the
{white limestone,the green glens,the   
{sandy beaches.}They come to play the  
 seaside golf courses ramble the forest
 paths ,climb the rocky cliffs. Indeed 
 rockfalls are a hazard on this road.  </content>
