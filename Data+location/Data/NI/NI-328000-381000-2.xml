		<content>   There are many important roads going
 into and through the area. The M2 is  
 the main road linking Belfast and the 
 rest of the country. The Roundabout at
 Sandyknowes was the biggest round_    
 about in N.Ireland when it was built  
 in the 1960's. This junction provides 
 access for the residential area of    
 Glengormley, the Hydepark Industrial  
 Estate and the port of Larne along the
 A8(M) to Belfast and the West.  The   
 opening of the M2 has greatly enhanced
 the development of the Glengormley and
 the Hydepark Industrial Estate. It    
 also reduced traffic along the old    
 Antrim Road and through the centre of 
 Glengormley. Other major roads are the
 Ballyclare Road and the Carnmoney Road
 which link these areas with the centre
 of Glengormley. The Mallusk Road links
 the Mallusk Village with Glengormley  
 and is used by commercial vehicles.   </content>
