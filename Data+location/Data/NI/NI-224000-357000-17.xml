		<title>17The old railway.</title>
		<content> Through our area there is a line      
 marking a dismantled railway. It comes
 on to our section of the map at G.R.  
 257570 and runs north and north west  
 going off our section of map at       
 240580. Irvinestown was linked to the 
 rest of Ireland in 1866 with the      
 official opening of the Enniskillen,  
 Bundoran and Sligo line. The last     
 train came into Irvinestown on the    
 20-9-57.                              
 All that remains now are the cuttings 
 and embankments where the trains ran, 
 but there is no evidence of the lines 
 themselves. Irvinestown still has the 
 remains of the old waiting room and   
 the signal box on which the name      
 Irvinestown is printed. The signal box
 is still in very good shape and is a  
 reminder of days gone by when trains  
 puffed through the town.
