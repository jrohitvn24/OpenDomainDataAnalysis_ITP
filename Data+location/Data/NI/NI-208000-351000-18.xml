		<title>18GIRL GUIDES AND BOY SCOUTS</title>
		<content> The old St.Patrick's Hall, remembered 
 by capacity audiences as the venue for
 so many fine productions of plays     
 written mostly by Irish authors,is now
 the meeting place for Boy Scouts and  
 Girl Guides. Friday evenings from     
 7.30 pm to 9.00 pm sees the Scouts    
 engaged in various games, activities  
 and training, while on Tuesdays,      
 during the same hours,the Guides are  
 similarly occupied.                   
                    Both groups have   
 their annual camping holiday each     
 summer, which is generally regarded as
 the highlight of the year's           
 activities. The cost of this to each  
 boy or girl usually works out between 
 ten and fifteen pounds.               
                       The Scouts'     
 uniform is predominantly blue and     
 navy, while the Guides' is blue and   
 brown.                                </content>
