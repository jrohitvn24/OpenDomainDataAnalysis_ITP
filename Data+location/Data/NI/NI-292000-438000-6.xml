		<title>06 The Salmon Fisheries</title>
		<content> The salmon fisheries are located      
beside the river to the South of the   
town of Bushmills.                     
                                       
 The purpose of the Fish Farm is to    
breed salmon and trout as experiments. 
About 1200 salmon pass up the River    
Bush.  There are 8 people employed and 
half of them live locally.  All the    
employees are men.  There are 6        
Industrial workers and 2 Office Staff. 
                                       
 Visiting is made by appointment only  
and most of the visitors are School    
Parties which visit in the summer.  The
Fish Farm opened in 1972 and has a 30  
year lease from the Mac Naughten       
estate.
