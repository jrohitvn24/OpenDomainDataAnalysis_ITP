		<title>01  Downpatrick</title>
		<content> Downpatrick is 22 miles south-east of 
 Belfast and has good road connections 
 with that city.The population is about
 10,000.                               
   It is the historic county town of   
 County Down.Traces of its history,    
 perhaps even prehistoric,are buried   
 beneath the central area,an 18th      
 century and early Victorian           
 townscape.                            
   Its character is influenced by its  
 layout of roads and buildings.The     
 narrow 18th and 19th century street   
 pattern of{English,Irish,Scotch }     
{Streets}is obvious in the town centre.
   In the 20th century the town has    
 become an important market,service and
 administrative centre.                
   Built on the floodplain of the      
{Quoile River}and surrounded by        
 drumlins,Downpatrick is still growing.
