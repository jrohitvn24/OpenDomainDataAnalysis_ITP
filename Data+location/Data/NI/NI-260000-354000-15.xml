		<title>15MODERN USE OF LISDOART MILL</title>
		<content> Most of the mill buildings are now    
 disused however some of them are used 
 by the Housing Executive as a store   
 for machinery and materials.          
    Some of the other buildings have a 
 different use. They are used by the   
 Government for some purpose but it is 
 not known exactly what for. We asked  
 several individuals including         
 employees at the mill, but they said  
 they could not tell us. It seems      
 whatever it is being used for the     
 Government do not want people to know.
 One person we asked said that if we   
 wanted any information we would have  
 to ask someone higher up.             
    Local rumour suggests that the mill
 is being used by the Government as a  
 flour store, the flour being stored   
 for use in such an emergency as a war.
