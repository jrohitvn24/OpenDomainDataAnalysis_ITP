		<content> HUNTING AND SHOOTING IS A REGULAR     
 SPORT ROUND CREGGAN. NEARLY EVERY MAN 
 HAS A SHOTGUN, AND SPORTSMEN COME     
 FROM ALL OVER. MOST PEOPLE GO IN FOR  
 DUCK SHOOTING ALONG THE SHORES OF     
 LOUGH NEAGH. THE HUNTING SEASON STARTS
 IN THE AUTUMN AND LASTS TO THE END OF 
 WINTER. THE MEN MUST BE OUT VERY EARLY
 IN THE MORNING WHEN THE DUCKS RISE.   
 THEY STAY IN A HUT AND WAIT FOR THE   
 DUCKS AND THEY BRING A PACKED LUNCH TO
 LAST THEM THROUGH THE DAY.            
                                       
 THE HUNTER'S BEST FRIEND IS HIS DOG.  
 IF HE SHOOTS A DUCK IT USUALLY FALLS  
 INTO THE WATER AND THE DOG IS TRAINED 
 TO SWIM OUT AND BRING BACK THE DUCK   
 CAREFULLY IN HIS MOUTH WITHOUT        
 DAMAGING IT.                          
                                       
 THE HUNTERS ALSO TRY FOR PHEASANTS AND
 OTHER WILD FOWL.                      </content>
