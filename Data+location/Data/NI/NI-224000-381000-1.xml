		<content> THE CASTLEDERG AREA IS ESSENTIALLY A  
 RURAL AREA OF N. IRELAND.LIKE ALL     
 RURAL AREAS OF THE U.K. IT SUFFERS    
 FROM THE PROBLEMS OF RISING           
 UNEMPLOYMENT, A RURAL EXODUS, LACK OF 
 SERVICES AND AMENITIES AND A GENERAL  
 FALL IN POPULATION NUMBERS. CASTLEDERG
 ALSO HAS THE PROBLEM OF THE N.I.      
 POLITICAL SITUATION, BEING IN AN AREA 
 WHICH HAS A HIGH RATE OF {            
{RELIGIOUS/POLITICAL }CONFLICT,WHICH   
 HAS NOT ATTRACTED ANY FORM OF         
 EMPLOYMENT TO THE AREA -  AS IS       
 EVIDENT IN THE REST OF THE PROVINCE.  
     THE CATCH PHRASE "WEST OF THE     
 BANN" IS GIVEN TO THE AREA ON THE WEST
 SIDE OF THE RIVER BANN WHICH SEPERATES
 THE EAST AND WEST OF THE PROVINCE -THE
 EAST ATTRACTS INDUSTRY WHILE THE WEST 
 TENDS TO ATTRACT NOTHING.THIS AREA HAS
 REDUCED IT'S POPULATION BECAUSE OF THE
 RURAL AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.      </content>
