		<title>03BALTEAGH RECTORY</title>
		<content> The Rev. Hemphill lives in Balteagh   
 rectory.  He has 6 children and he is 
 the minister of both Balteagh and     
 Carrick Parish Churches.  A new       
 rectory was built when Mr. Hemphill   
 came to Limavady in 1978. It is a big 
 modern bungalow with 4 bedrooms, a    
 study, 2 living rooms, a kitchen and a
 bathroom, but when you compare it with
 the old rectory it is very small. That
 was a large 3 storey house of 5200    
 square feet with 27 rooms.  The old   
 rectory was built in 1887 of Dungiven 
 sandstone, with Bangor blue slates,   
 the woodwork of pitch pine and the    
 walls were insulated with peat.  The  
 last rector to live there was Rev.    
 Heaslett who died in 1981.
