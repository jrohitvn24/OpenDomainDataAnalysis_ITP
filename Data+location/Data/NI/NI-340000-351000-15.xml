		<content> My name is Calvin Watson and I live at
 "The Haw".The Ha' is short for the    
 hall but we now call it"The Haw".James
 Wauchope served Lieutenant - Colonel  
 James Trails who gave James Wauchope  
 Drumaghlis in the 17th Century.He     
 built himself "The Haw".This place is 
 now in ruins.James Wauchope died in   
 1662 leaving his home to his son who  
 died in childhood.Up our fields there 
 are some houses in one particular     
 spot.A woman came one day and looked  
 at them.She said one of them was a    
 chapel because she saw a place to set 
 cups in.There is a lane that comes    
 from the back road which runs to the  
 houses and then to "The Haw"
