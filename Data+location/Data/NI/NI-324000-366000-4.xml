		<content>{ Agriculture}is mainly{grassland}based
 and is concerned with{grazing or hay  
{and silage making.}It is very highly  
{mechanized.                           
  The field sizes vary but are mostly  
 moderate in area and are typically    
 bounded by a Hawthorn hedge.          
  The grass is almost exclusively used 
 for the rearing of{beef and dairy     
{cattle.}The former are to be found    
 mostly on the higher ground,whilst the
 latter are mainly confined to the     
 lower ground.                         
  The farms are moderately sized with  
 additional land being bought or rented
 as required.                          
  There are a few flocks of{sheep}kept 
 on the highest ground.                
  On the more favoured lower land,there
 is some vegetable growing and the     
 occasional field of oilseed for sheep 
 fodder in winter.                     </content>
