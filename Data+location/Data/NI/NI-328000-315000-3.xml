		<content> is taken to be stored in the silage   
 shed. Here, it has to be firmly rolled
 to remove all the air and thus        
 preserve the important minerals it    
 contains. Mr. Houston keeps around 50 
 beef cattle and sheep plus a few pigs 
 although the number may, in summer, be
 half this. He buys and sells most of  
 his stock in Kilkeel, Newry or Dublin 
 markets.                              
  Around 20 of Mr. Houston's 35 acres  
 grow potatoes - most of which he sells
 to Middle and Near Eastern countries. 
  Most of the farm machinery is for    
 working the grass, e.g. silage cutter,
 buck rake, tractor and trailer; other 
 necessary equipment he hires.         
  Mr. Houston grew up on a farm and    
 hopes to continue farming for the rest
 of his working life.
