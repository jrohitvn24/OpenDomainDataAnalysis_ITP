		<content>    The{major road}which passes through
 one corner of the area is the{A8}which
 links the  ferry  port of {Larne }with
{Belfast},{Ballyclare}and the {airport.
 The A8  carries a large volume  of car
 and lorry  traffic  through {Ballynure
 and as a result, a  pedestrian  subway
 was built in 1982 to link the old part
 of the  village to the  east, with the
 primary school and houses to the west.
    The other roads  in the  area  link
 the farming communities with  the main
 town  of  Ballyclare  which serves the
 area. They are all minor roads but due
 to the  increase in  rural  population
 they are become more widely used.
