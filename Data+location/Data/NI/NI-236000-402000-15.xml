		<title>15THE COACH INN AT CLOUGHCOR</title>
		<content> 300 YEARS AGO THE DUBLIN-DERRY COACHES
 STOPPED AT THE COACH INN.THERE WERE   
 STABLES AT THE REAR OF THE INN WHERE  
 THE HORSES WERE CHANGED.THE BUILDING  
 HAS BEEN A LANDMARK IN THE AREA FOR A 
 LONG TIME.PARTS OF THE ORIGINAL INN   
 ARE STILL TO BE SEEN.THE WINDOWS OF   
 THE DOWNSTAIRS BAR ARE ANTIQUE AND    
 DATE BACK TO THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION.
 PEOPLE USED TO STAY OVERNIGHT AT THE  
 INN BUT WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF MORE 
 RAPID FORMS OF TRANSPORT THIS IS NOT  
 THE CASE NOWADAYS.BEDS,MEALS,DRINK AND
 STABLING FACILITIES WERE PROVIDED BUT 
 THESE HAVE NOW BEEN REPLACED BY A MORE
 MODERN BAR WHERE THE TRAVELLER MAY    
 STOP FOR A WELCOME DRINK TO BREAK THE 
 JOURNEY.THE PRESENT OWNERS HAVE MADE  
 THEIR PREMISES A POPULAR PLACE TO CALL
 AND PROVIDE ENTERTAINMENT ON A FRIDAY 
 AND SATURDAY NIGHT.
