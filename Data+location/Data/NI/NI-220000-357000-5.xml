		<content> In the Irvinestown area we have seven 
 housing estates Brownhill Meadows 33, 
 Reihill Park 51,Sallyswood 100,Hudson 
 Heights 49,Townhill Park 41,Forthill  
 Park 44 and Castle Sreet 31.Most of   
 the houses are owned by the Housing   
 Executive but some people have bought 
 their houses and made improvements.If 
 they wanted to extend the house with  
 more rooms they would have plans drawn
 up and then seek planning permission. 
 If they are allowed to build they  set
 work out to contract with a builder.  
 Other improvements they might want are
 central heating,double glazing,new    
 doors,roof insulation and pebble      
 dashing on the outside walls.Private  
 houses have been built around the town
 recently,many of these are bungalows. 
 On the main street only about 50% of  
 the houses are now used for residences
 as many are used solely for business. </content>
