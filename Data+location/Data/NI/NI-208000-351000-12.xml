		<title>12GROWTH OF CHEESE INDUSTRY</title>
		<content> Our cheese factory is reckoned to be  
 about the only one in west Ulster.    
 David Mitchell and Allistar Johnston  
 saw there was a market for Cottage and
 Mozzarella Cheese and the closure of  
 the old Creamery meant premises were  
 available.The building was leased to  
 the Lough Erne Creamery and from there
 the industry grew.                    
              Between the end of 1982  
 and April 1984,this small company got 
 into financial difficulties.The West  
 Ulster Farmers then undertook the task
 of running it.Promptly an old room was
 converted into a new production room  
 for Mozzarella.Its growth continues   
 and the current aim is to produce 3   
 tonnes of Cottage Cheese and 5 tonnes 
 of Mozzarella, per week.
