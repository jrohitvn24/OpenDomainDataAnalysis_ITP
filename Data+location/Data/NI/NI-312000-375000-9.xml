		<title>09THE CROOKED GLEN IN CRUMLIN</title>
		<content> In the village of Crumlin there is a  
 Glen,which is now being renovated by  
 workmen.Major works are being carried 
 out,such as making a large car_park,  
 toilets,a caravan site and making new 
 stone paths through the Glen.In the   
 Glen there is a river which is called 
 Camlin meaning the Crooked Glen.An    
 interesting feature in the Glen is the
 wishing stone on which you can make   
 wishes all year round.Nearby is a     
 Cockle_house which was repaired in    
 1984.From the Cockle_house you can    
 look across at the water_fall which   
 was created for the mill.There are    
 certain special places along the river
 banks which are used by the fishermen 
 to catch fish.In summer time the      
 ground is covered with blue-bells,    
 ,buttercups and wild garlic which has 
 a very strong scent. I hope the glen  
 will become a great beauty spot.      </content>
