		<content>  There is still a great 'belief' among
 many of the residents, especially     
 those living in the countryside, in   
 traditional Irish superstitions       
 eg. Fairy trees; banshees; 'charms';  
 magpies etc.                          
{ Fairy trees}-- there are several     
 fields within the area which are clear
 except for a single tree (generally a 
 Hawthorne), which the farmer believes 
 is property of the fairies.           
{ Banshees}-- these are by translation 
 from the Irish - 'Fairy women'. Their 
 presence is noted by a high-pitched   
 wailing and screaming, which is       
 followed soon after by the death of   
 someone in the family circle.{(Magpies
 also traditionally herald a death when
 they tarry at a house)                
  A person, who has a{'charm'}has the  
 'power' to heal or cure someone of an 
 ailment such as toothache or warts etc</content>
