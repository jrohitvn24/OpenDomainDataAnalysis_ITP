		<title>17LIFE IN BALLYCLARE</title>
		<content>    Life in  Ballyclare is very homely 
 and  warm. Everybody  seems  to  know 
 everybody else.Any shop  you go  into 
 is warmed by {hospitality.            
{                                      
{  }There is not so much in Ballyclare 
 for the {younger generation}but there 
 several blocks of houses and flats in 
 Ballyclare for the elderly.           
                                       
 Ballyclare  is  not  dirty  and  cold 
 desolated as  some  towns are.In fact 
 by the looks of  things  the majority 
 of Ballyclare  folk  are  house proud.
 There are only a few  houses  in need 
 of repair.I am sure  anybody  who has 
 lived in Ballyclare will always  meet 
 a friend whilst on  a shopping  visit 
 to Ballyclare.                        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
