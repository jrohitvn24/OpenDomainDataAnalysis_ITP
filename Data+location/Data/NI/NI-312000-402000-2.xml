		<content>{LANDSCAPE} This part of mid-Antrim is 
 situated right in the middle of       
 Ulster's most fertile and prosperous  
 farming regions.                      
{RELIEF}    This area is equally       
 divided between a flat lowland belt   
 (c.60m contour line) and an upland    
 plateau (c.130m).The highest point is 
 at Roslin Hill(138.7m).               
{SLEMISH}   The main focus of attention
 is Slemish mountain(448m) lying to the
 N.E. of this area.It was on this      
 solitary extinct volcano that         
 Patrick,Ireland's patron saint, is    
 said to have herded swine.            
{DRAINAGE}  The main river is the Rv.  
 Braid, noted for its fish. There are  
 also two burns,the Deerfin and the    
 Devenagh.At the lowest levels there is
 frequent flooding,resulting in a      
 substantial area of uncultivated      
 bog,used only for rough grazing.      </content>
