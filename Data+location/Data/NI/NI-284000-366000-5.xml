		<title>05FIRST COMMUNION /COALISLAND</title>
		<content> All of us involved in the survey of   
{Coalisland are Roman Catholics}as are 
 most of the people who live in the    
 area. This accounts for the close     
 links between family celebrations and 
 religious ceremonies. One special     
 family event that we all remember was 
 when we received our{First Holy       
{Communion}at the age of seven.We      
 prepared in school for months         
 beforehand. We had to learn our       
 prayers and our religious doctrine and
 prove to our teachers and priests     
 that we were ready for this ceremomy  
 In the week before the big day we     
 went to confession for the first      
 time. There we told the prist all     
 the things we had done wrong and      
 asked God to forgive us. On the day   
 we all wore new clothes. The boys     
 wore suits with badges attached,the   
 girls wore white dresses with veils.  </content>
