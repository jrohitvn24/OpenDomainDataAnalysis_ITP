		<title>09NEWTOWNARDS HOMELIFE/HABITS</title>
		<content> Home life style in Newtownards splits 
 into two categories. Many families    
 have lived in the area for generations
 and depend greatly on grandparents and
 other relations. However, recently the
 town has expanded greatly with new    
 housing estates springing up on the   
 outskirts of the town. These          
 inhabitants tend to migrate from other
 towns so family life is based on a    
 nuclear unit. Eating habits vary      
 greatly. Many traditional foods such  
 as potato bread, soda bread and the   
 'Ulster Fry' are consumed. Also many  
 carry-out shops and restaurants have  
 opened some of which specialise in    
 foreign foods. Newtownards shows its  
 awareness of household safety through 
 its Home Safety Association.          
 Popular family pets are dogs, cats,   
 rabbits and hamsters.
