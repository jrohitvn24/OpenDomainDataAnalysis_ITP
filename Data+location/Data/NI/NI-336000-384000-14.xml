		<title>14  KNOCKAGH;THE MONUMENT</title>
		<content>  Since 1924 the venerable head of the 
{KNOCKAGH HILL}has worn a crown. In    
 that year a memorial to the people of 
 County Antrim who lost their lives in 
 the {Great War of 1914-18}was erected 
 on the highest point of the 967 foot  
 hill and to this day a poppy wreath is
 placed at its foot on Remembrance Day.
  The memorial is in the form of an    
 obelisk 110 feet in height which was  
 paid for by public subscription and   
 constructed of a stone base surmounted
 by a concrete pinnacle.Facing the sea 
 is a plaque bearing the inscription:-{
{ To the Glory of God and in proud and 
{affectionate remembrance of the men of
{County Antrim who fell in the Great   
{War,this memorial is erected by their 
{grateful County.   "Nobly you fought, 
{your knightly virtue proved,   Your   
{memory hallowed in the land you loved"
