		<content> Our block in East Down is one of farms
 and link roads based on{drumlins.}The}
 central place is{Drumaroad,}a village 
 of one hundred and fifty inhabitants. 
 To the north, Dunmore Mountain,covered
 by whins(gorse), rises to 200 metres. 
 East of this, Draper Hill,a drumlin,  
 forms the townland of Scrib. Hills of 
 scrub and farmland in Drumnakelly and 
 Tannaghmore are seen to the northeast.
 Drumnaquoile (southwest) is fragmented
 by hawthorn hedges and stone ditches  
 (walls). Drumanaghan, due south, holds
 a derelict claghan{(village)}Shanbally
 Undulating farmland leads one to the  
 south-east where the{Forde Demesne}   
 provides a view of mature beech woods.
 The{landscape}features pasture and hay
 fields over our whole area, softened  
 by wetlands in valley bottoms. Modern 
 farm residences prevail.Drumlin crests
 have overgrown{forts}(ancient farms). </content>
