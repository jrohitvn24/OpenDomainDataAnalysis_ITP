		<content> Methods of transport used to get      
 to work are - seventeen by car, seven 
 on foot, and four by bus.  One person 
 took ten seconds to go to work while  
 other people took half a minute, and  
 half an hour.                         
                                       
 It was a few yards, 100 yards and     
 one-quarter of a mile to the          
 interviewees' workplaces from their   
 homes but it only took them five      
 minutes to get there.                 
                                       
 The people we interviewed all lived   
 in Holywood and they were very        
 pleasant and co-operative.            
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
