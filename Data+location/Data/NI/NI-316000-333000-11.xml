		<title>11TRADE IN RATHFRILAND</title>
		<content>   IN RATHFRILAND TRADE PLAYS AN       
 IMPORTANT PART,AS THERE ARE MANY SMALL
 SHOPS, A LIVESTOCK MARKET AND AN OPEN 
 AIR MARKET.                           
   THE OPEN AIR MARKET COMES TO        
 RATHFRILAND EVERY WEDNESDAY. IT       
 ATTRACTS QUITE A LARGE CROWD TO THE   
 TOWN. THE STALL OWNERS COME FROM      
 NEIGHBOURING TOWNS SUCH AS KILKEEL,   
 WARRENPOINT, PORTADOWN AND BANBRIDGE. 
 THE STALLS SELL GOODS WHICH INCLUDE   
 FLOWERS AND PLANTS, CLOTHES, BOOKS,   
 TAPES, FISH AND OTHER GENERAL ITEMS.  
   THE STALLS ARE SET UP AROUND        
 8:30a.m. AND TRADE COMMENCES AT       
 9:00a.m. USUALLY FINISHING AT 5:30p.m.
   THIS MARKET HAS ALWAYS BEEN HELD IN 
 THE SQUARE WHICH IS IN THE CENTRE OF  
 THE TOWN.HOWEVER, TRADE IN THIS MARKET
 HAS DECLINED RECENTLY AS THE LOCAL    
 PEOPLE HAVE BECOME MORE DEPENDENT ON  
 THE SHOPS.                            </content>
