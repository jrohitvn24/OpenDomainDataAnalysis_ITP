 LONDONDERRY.A LOCAL SONG DECLARES THAT
 IT IS "JUST THREE MILES FROM DERRY TO 
 THE BRIDGE AT DRUMAHOE"BESIDE THIS    
 BRIDGE IS A BAR CALLED THE{THREE MILE 
{HOUSE."}THE RIVER FAUGHAN FLOWS       
 THROUGH DRUMAHOE AND IT IS BESIDE THIS
 RIVER THAT HOUSING HAS DEVELOPED.     
  THE VILLAGE HAS GROWN ENORMOUSLY OVER
 THE YEARS.  AT FIRST THE HOUSING WAS  
 SMALL RURAL COTTAGES SOME OF WHICH    
 STILL REMAIN, FOR EXAMPLE FINCAIRN    
 COTTAGES; THERE WERE ALSO LARGE HOUSES
 OF ESTATE OWNERS AND MILL OWNERS WHICH
 REMAIN.  A SMALL RURAL HOUSING ESTATE 
 WAS THEN BUILT.                       
 OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS THE VILLAGE HAS
 GROWN ENORMOUSLY.  NEW PUBLIC HOUSING 
 ESTATES HAVE BEEN BUILT.  PRIVATE     
 HOUSING ESTATES HAVE BEEN BUILT       
 AND DRUMAHOE IS NOW ONE OF THE GROWING
 SUBURBS OF LONDONDERRY.               </content>
