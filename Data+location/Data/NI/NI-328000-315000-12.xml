		<content>  In an interview with Mrs. Sarah      
 Annett we were told how she makes     
 Potato Bread. She says her mother     
 taught her how to make "Tattie Bread" 
 and she had been taught by her mother.
  First of all Mrs. Annett told us that
 she normally used potatoes left over  
 from dinner which she mashed and mixed
 with flour and salt - the amount of   
 flour being a matter of experience.   
  Although the mixture can be cooked in
 a pan Mrs. Annett produced an old     
 circular griddle and set it on the    
 kitchen range. She rolled and         
 quartered her mixture and "dry fried" 
 it. After only a couple of minutes    
 Mrs. Annett presented us with hot     
 tattie bread and butter - Mourne      
 style.
