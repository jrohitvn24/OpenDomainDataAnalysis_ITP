		<content> Each year the town has a{Civic Week}in
 which all  local  organisations take a
 part.  These have included the staging
 of a{ Hiring Fair}with  farm lads  and
 servant girls being hired for the next
 half year as in times past.Stalls sell
 traditional dulse and yellow man.     
                                       
 Other  traditions are  associated with
 the commemoration of the{Battle of the
{Boyne.}  Arches  are  built  over some
 streets and bunting is put up.  On the
 eve of  the {Twelth of July  }bonfires
 are lit in  Antiville and  other parts
 of the town. On the day itself members
 of the{Orange Order}leave to parade at
 a rally .                             
 The traditions of Hallowe'en are still
 practised mainly by younger children.
