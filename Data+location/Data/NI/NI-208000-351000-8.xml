		<title>08THE CANON MAGUIRE PARK</title>
		<content> The Canon Maguire Park was first      
 bought by the football club in        
 1958.It was drained and opened in     
 1962.After 21 years of service it was 
 felt that a Prunty Type Pitch would   
 serve the community of Derrygonnelly  
 better.Work proceeded and this new    
 pitch was completed in 1983.There was 
 a grand opening day on the 9th May    
 1983.The occasion was celebrated by   
 having an inter-club 9-a-side         
 tournament.Even though many           
 footballers and supporters volunteered
 their services, the final outlay on   
 the project was around Â£60,000.The    
 provision of dressing rooms and       
 toilets is currently being undertaken.
     The Park is used for Camogie and  
 Gaelic Football and various other     
 sporting activities.
