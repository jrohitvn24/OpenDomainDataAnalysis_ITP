		<title>12Shopping In Larne</title>
		<content>  Larne is reasonably well provided    
 for as far as shops as concerned.     
 There are six supermarkets in the     
 town, selling a full range of goods   
 from food products to household       
 necessities to clothing.              
 These stores attract people from a    
 radius of up to twenty kilometres for 
 weekly shopping.                      
 Each part of the town has its own     
 'local' shop, but here prices are more
 expensive because the small shop has  
 not as great a turnover and therefore 
 cannot afford to take a cut in profit 
 to compete with the town centre       
 stores.                               
 The town is well supplied with shoe   
 shops, food stores, newsagents and    
 greengrocers.There is a lack of choice
 in chemists and ladies' fashion shops.
