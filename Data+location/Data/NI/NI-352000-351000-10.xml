		<title>10Tourism in Killyleagh.</title>
		<content>  This stone was erected to remind     
 visitors of Sloane's association with 
 the town.He is said to have been born 
 on the site of 13 Church Hill.        
  The local parish church which graces 
 the town also carries a commemorative 
 plaque for the Rev. Hinks, the        
 Egyptologist, who brought back finds  
 for the Ulster Museum in Belfast.     
  Some sections of the town benefit    
 from this local history as well as the
 sailing, and in the summer the local  
 public houses and hoteliers see some  
 increase in their trade. One          
 inparticular, 'The Fool's Penny',     
 overlooking Strangford Lough, gets    
 many tourists from all over the world,
 such as Canada, Australia and even    
 China. The Town's largest hotel is    
 being renovated to provide a          
 superior service for guests who visit 
 Killyleagh.                           </content>
