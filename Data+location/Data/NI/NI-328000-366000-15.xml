		<title>15A SCHOOLBOY'S SATURDAY</title>
		<content> On Saturday I got up at nine o'clock  
 to watch television and then went out 
 to play small ball. After this I was  
 given my pocket money (80 pence) and  
 bought water bombs to throw at my     
 brother. I went round to my friend's  
 to play football, and was the first to
 score ten, so I won as usual. At three
 thirty I went swimming, having had a  
 dinner of fish and chips. Richard came
 with me to swim. After swimming I     
 again played football, with me and    
 my brother against my friend and his  
 father. I spent the evening watching  
 television and then went to bed       
 upstairs after having a read.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
