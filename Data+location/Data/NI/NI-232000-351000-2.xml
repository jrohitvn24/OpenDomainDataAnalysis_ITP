		<title>02A school child's morning.</title>
		<content>      A typical day for me would start 
 when mammy calls me at 8.00am.I don't 
 get up until 8.30am.I dress usually in
 jeans as our school does not have a   
 uniform.I go up to the kitchen for a  
 cup of tea.We get the school bus at   
 the bottom of the lane at 8.50am.I    
 always save a place for my two friends
 Ciara and Rita at the back of the bus.
      When we reach the school at      
 9.15am we go out to the toilets to    
 have a chat for a few minutes with our
 other two friends Geraldine and Agnes.
 When we go into class we say prayers  
 and have Religion.We usually do Maths 
 and English and sometimes Workcards.  
 We have our two course lunch from     
 12.15pm to 12.40pm in the school      
 dining hall and have playtime until   
 12.55pm.
