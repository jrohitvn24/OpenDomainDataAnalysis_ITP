		<content> There are seven farmers in this block 
 who buy{store lambs}in the autumn to  
 finish off as fatteners during the    
 winter months. These lambs are reared 
 on the nearby Antrim mountains in the 
 summer months and then sold to lowland
 farmers. They thrive well coming      
 off the poorer mountain pastures. The 
 average size of these flocks is 75 to 
 100 head. They are mainly{Cross-bred _
 that is a cross between a{Border      
{Leicester}ram and a{Blackface}ewe.    
 There are no farms depending solely   
 on sheep. The farmer buys in{Pellets  
 and farm produces{Barley}or{Oats}for  
 supplementary feed. Some farmers grow 
{Turnips}for sheep. When there is frost
 or snow it is essential that the sheep
 are given concentrates to eat_that    
 is{Barley or Oats}along with a sheep  
 lick. The lambs are mostly sold       
 through {Ballymoney Market.           </content>
