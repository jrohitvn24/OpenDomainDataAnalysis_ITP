		<content> Bushtown is another place of          
 interest There is a Legend as to how  
 it got its name.The legend says that  
 whilst the building of a Church was   
 taking place a savage bull kept       
 appearing and wrecking that which had 
 been built. This went on for a long   
 time until the priest went to the site
 to guard it.When the bull appeared the
 priest got a stick and beat the bull  
 He then stuck the stick in the ground 
 and dared the bull to pass.The bull   
 left and never returned.The stick that
 the priest stuck in the ground took   
 root and grew into a bush.This bush   
 can be seen to this day. The town is  
 about a mile and a quarter outside the
 village of Hilltown near to the       
 Kilkeel,Bryansford roads.
