		<title>18ENTERPRISE HOUSE</title>
		<content> The age of the workers starts at 16   
 to middle aged. Some have had previous
 experiences using their talents but   
 for some it is their first time. If   
 anybody gets into financial difficulty
 Enterprise House will give them cash  
 to get going again. In the beginning  
 the people will get support and help  
 to buy machinery.                     
 There are three similar complexes in  
 Northern Ireland. They are in Belfast,
 Londonderry and Newry. There are also 
 some in England and Scotland. Mr.Boal,
 the development officer,went to look  
 at these and said the best was at     
 Clarkenwell in London.                
 The complex will find jobs for 200 _  
 250 people. In the first year Â£70000  
 is hoped to be raised in rent. As it  
 costs Â£500 p.a. per person in         
 unemployment benifit,the government   
 are saving Â£1000000 p.a. PAMELA GABBEY</content>
