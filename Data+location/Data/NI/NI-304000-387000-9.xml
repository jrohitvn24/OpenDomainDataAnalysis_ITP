		<title>09FISHERMEN ON THE LOUGH</title>
		<content> FISHING FAMILIES HAVE EARNED A LIVING 
 FROM EEL FISHING ON THE LOUGH FOR MANY
 GENERATIONS. THEY ARE A VERY PROUD AND
 INDEPENDANT PEOPLE WHO WORK VERY HARD 
 AND FOR LONG HOURS. THE LINES ARE SET 
 AT NIGHT AND COLLECTED EARLY IN THE   
 MORNING. WHEN THE DAY'S CATCH HAS BEEN
 LANDED AND COLLECTED. THE LINES HAVE  
 TO BE 'PEGGED' AND LEFT READY FOR THE 
 NEXT FISHING SESSION. THIS CONSISTS OF
 REPLACING THE HOOKS EVERY SIX INCHES  
 ON TWO AND A HALF MILES OF LINE AND   
 CAN TAKE UP TO THREE HOURS AND ALL THE
 FAMILY LEND A HAND. WHEN THE LINES ARE
 SET, THIS LONG LINE IS LET OUT BIT BY 
 BIT INTO THE WATER AND EACH HOOK HAS  
 TO BE BAITED INDIVIDUALLY. THIS CAN   
 TAKE HOURS OF PATIENT WORK ON THE COLD
 WATERS OF THE LOUGH, BUT FEW WOULD    
 CHANGE THEIR WAY OF LIFE AND FISHING  
 LICENCES ARE PRIZED POSSESIONS TO BE  
 HANDED DOWN FROM FATHER TO SON.       </content>
