{years.                                
  Life in this area over the past 60   
 years has changed dramatically.Indeed 
 one might almost call it a revolution.
 Most of the changes have been for the 
 better.                               
 In the early years of this century    
 women wore long skirts,big hats,and   
 their hair tied in a bun knot.Most men
 had moustaches.Women today wear very  
 fashionable clothes.They even wear    
 trousers which at the beginning of the
 century were considered rather bold   
 and worn by men.                      
 Most people walked wherever they      
 wanted to go.You could also go by     
 railway or by bike.A good Raleigh bike
 cost from Â£10_Â£20. A Raleigh bike     
 today would cost about Â£100.Today     
 people usually travel by cars or      
 buses.                                </content>
