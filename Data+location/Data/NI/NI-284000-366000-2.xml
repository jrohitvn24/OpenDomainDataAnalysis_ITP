		<content>{The family is still the most important
{unit in our society. Most families    
{surveyed in our school are still two  
{parent families, with the majority of 
{one parent families being due to the  
{death of a parent. The average size of
{family in our class worked out at 4.4 
{with the number of children ranging   
{from one to twelve. }                 
 In the{Coalisland}area the importance 
 attached to family life is shown by   
 the fact the the new Roman  Catholic  
 church was named the church of the    
{Holy Family.}The Boy Scout troop      
 formed in 1983 is named the Holy      
 Family 10th {Tyrone Boy Scouts .      
 Family life still provides most of the
 occasions for celebration,even        
 funerals  in our area have a certain  
 element of celebration attached to    
 them. Religious occasions and family  
 celebrations are closely linked.      </content>
