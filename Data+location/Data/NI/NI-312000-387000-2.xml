		<content>{LOUGH NEAGH ECOLOGY:                  
{BIRD LIFE:}The majority of Lough      
 Neaghs mid winter wildfowl population 
 consists of ducks which dive for their
 food.Examples of these are            
 Pochard,Tufted duck and Goldeneye.They
 rely mainly on the larvae of the Lough
 Neagh fly for their food.Swans are    
 to be found in sheltered areas.       
{FISH: }Eels can be found in Lough     
 Neagh.They feed on algae,fly larvea   
 and other planktonic creatures.       
 Salmon arrive in Lough Neagh in early 
 June on their way to the river and    
 streams to spawn.                     
 Pollen or freshwater Herring  are not 
 as popular for the fisherman as they  
 were before 1900.                     
 Lough Neagh trout or dollaghan are not
 now as plentiful as they once were.   
 Roach have recently been introduced   
 into the Lough Neagh basin.           </content>
