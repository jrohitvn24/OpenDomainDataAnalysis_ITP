		<content>   The second industry is a{pre-cast}  
{concrete}works,and it,too,has been    
 operating for about 30 years. Here the
 concrete is put into moulds to harden 
 to make the various items. The moulds 
 may be made from wood or metal,and    
 more recently from fibre-glass - this 
 last type being made in Banbridge. The
 firm produces a wide variety of items 
 specified by the Dept. of Environment,
 the Housing Executive,the local       
 Council,the Electricity Service or by 
 the many builders within a 20-mile    
 radius as well as by the individual   
 customer. Items produced include lamp-
 post bases,traffic bollards,fence     
 posts,paving and kerb stones,cattle   
 troughs,sills,garden gnomes and urns  
 etc.about 50 different items.The sand,
 cement and gravel used come from      
 Cookstown.Production stops during hard
 frost which damages hardening concrete</content>
