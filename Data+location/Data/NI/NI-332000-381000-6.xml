		<content>       What are we going to do to day? 
 Where will we go?  These are some of  
 the questions the young unemployed    
 people of our area ask themselves     
 every day of every week of every month
 of every year.                        
       Some older people thought they  
 were lucky when they got a job in{Lear
{Fan}but it didn't last long! Some of  
 those people had already lost a job   
 before from, maybe, I.C.I. in         
 Carrickfergus or the shipyard in      
 Belfast.                              
       A few years ago when a big      
 shopping centre opened ( called{Abbey 
{Centre}) some lucky people got jobs as
 cashiers and cleaners and other jobs  
 as well. But it was mostly women who  
 got these jobs.                       
       Everyone has hopes and fears in 
 our area. Some hope they will get a   
 job, some fear they might lose theirs.</content>
