		<title>05GROOMSPORT HARBOUR</title>
		<content>   It is believed that the original    
 harbour was built during the Viking   
 period.Today 8 small fishing boats and
 8 large ones use the harbour.         
 Groomsport itself has one permanent   
 boat employing 5 villagers full-time  
 and 6 part-time.The chief fish caught 
 is skate with the use of gill-nets.   
     About 65 pleasure boats also use  
 the harbour and most of these are     
 owned by Bangor residents(the town is 
 only 2km away).                       
     Cockle Island just offshore is a  
 small island protected and guarded for
 seabirds to allow them to breed.      
     During the summer the car park at 
 the harbour is packed with holiday-   
 makers.Many have come for a picnic or 
 want to swim in Cove Bay.In Winter    
 however the harbour is dead,the       
 caravans cannot be used,and only the  
 odd Belfast residednt may visit it.   </content>
