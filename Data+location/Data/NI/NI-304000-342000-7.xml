		<content> Sixty years ago, the only thing to do 
 if you wanted a bit of power to do    
 your work was to use a team of horses 
 pulling your plough or cart. This work
                                       
 was very hard and important for both  
 man beast.                            
 The women and children would often    
 clean eggs, milk the cows by hand,    
 cutting  flax, soaking it, and hanging
 it out to dry.                        
 The men worked out in the fields      
 ploughing, sowing, harvesting and     
 selling the crops.                    
 The meals were usually, potatoes,     
 bacon, turnips and buttermilk.  Only  
 the rich could have chops and other   
 luxuries.                             
 The pastimes for the girls would be   
 hopstotch while the boys played       
 Cowboys and Indians or Cops and       
 Robbers.                              </content>
