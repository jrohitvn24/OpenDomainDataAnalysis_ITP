		<title>03RIVER FOYLE</title>
		<content>    The River Foyle plays a very       
 important part in our block. It flows 
 in a northerly direction until it     
 enters the estuary of Lough Foyle at  
 Culmore Point. The depth of the river 
 is clearly important as the river     
 needs to be deep enough to facilitate 
 large ships. The river is deepest in  
 the narrow stretch of water to the    
 north of Madam's Bank.                
    The width of the river is also     
 important concerning both economic    
 factors and leisure activities. The   
 widest stretch of the river is at     
 Madam's Bank and the narrowest at     
 Culmore point.The port of Derry has   
 long been important and centuries of  
 trading has meant that this part of   
 the River Foyle has also been in      
 constant use.Large coal, cargo and    
 fishing boats have all used this      
 stretch of river.                     </content>
