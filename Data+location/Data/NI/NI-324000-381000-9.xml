  One night in 1718,{Shane and Nessie} 
 held up a farmer he found that he was 
 ill,poor and also expecting the       
 bailiff to evict him.Touched by his   
 story Shane lent the farmer the money 
 for his rent ,the farmer did not repay
 the money, but did give him shelter in
 time of trouble.{Nessie},who lived    
 near the Flush,Ballyutoague, was the  
 leader of a gang which terrorized     
 parishes. Once he went to a           
 party,mingled with the crowd,broke    
 into the house and stole all the      
 valuables.                            
   Nessie often fought soldiers.Later  
 he went to England,where he entered   
 the high jump in a regimental sports.A
 dragoon recognised him,he was brought 
 to Carrickfergus and hung in 1720.    </content>
