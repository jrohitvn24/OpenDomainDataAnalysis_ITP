		<content> RELIGION.The area which we have been  
 surveying is one of mixed religions,  
 mostly people of the Protestant and   
 Catholic faiths but there are also    
 some Jewish people.There are therefore
 quite a number of churches            
 representing the various faiths.The   
 mainCatholic churches are St. Therese 
 of Lisieux, St.Gerards,St.Mary's      
 Greencastle. The main Protestant      
 churchesare St. Peter's Antrim Road,  
 Rosemary Memorial Church and          
 Fortwilliam Presbyterian Church. There
 are also a large number of schools in 
 the general area primary,secondary    
 and grammar.Many of the schools are to
 be found clustered around one another 
 on the Somerton Road.There is also    
 a Jewish synagogue in the             
 area.Relatios between the various     
 groups in the area are very cordial.
