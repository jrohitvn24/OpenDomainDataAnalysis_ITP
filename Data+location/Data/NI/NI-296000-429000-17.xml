		<content> Most farmers in the area grow potatoes
 and one or two depend on them as a    
 sole source of income.The farmer      
 ploughs first, then rotavates, drills 
 and plants_with artificial fertiliser.
 An automatic planter can cover five   
 acres in a day_one manned by 2 people_
 2 or 3 acres. At harvest; yields of up
 to 20 tonnes/acre are expected.       
 Harvesters pick about 1 acre per day. 
 Potatoes are stored in sheds for some 
 weeks, then sold to merchants, and    
 those grown in this district are      
 renowned for their quality. The{Fane  
{Valley}potato packing depot processes 
 40 tonnes of potatoes every day and   
 rejects about five tonnes, which are  
 returned to the farmer for seed. Main 
 types are{Dunbars, British Queens,Home
{Guard}and{Pentland &amp; Dell.}Some are   
 exported, others sold to shops, take- 
 outs, etc.; in{Britain}and{Ireland.   </content>
