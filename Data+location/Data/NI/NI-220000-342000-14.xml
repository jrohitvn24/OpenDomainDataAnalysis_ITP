		<content>     Being an island transport presents
 some problems.For a long time,until   
 1950,the only access to the town was  
 by two bridges,the present East       
 bridge(1892) and the West bridge      
 (1885).These two were connected by the
 main street along which most of the   
 building took place.By the late       
 1940's,with a growing town a new      
 bridge was built,north to Cornagrade  
 (Johnston bridge 1950).Then in the    
 fifties the northern part of the      
 island had a road constructed and a   
 new bridge built beside the East      
 bridge(Queen Elizabeth bridge 1954).  
 Since then a further bridge has been  
 built beside the West bridge (1982-3  
 Castle bridge) Currently road         
 improvements going on along the south 
 of the island will eventually lead to 
 another bridge being built close to   
 the East one (money permitting).      </content>
