		<content>  Mr.Watterson gave us some interesting
 facts about the development of        
 Groomsport village since World War 2. 
 There is no Secondary School there but
 the new Primary School built some 20  
 years ago now has 70 pupils.There are 
 3 shops now serving the community,one 
 of them a supermarket.                
     Fishing has seriously declined as 
 a source of employment.Once there were
 about 10 fishing boats and the        
 fishermen lived in thatched cottages  
 near the harbour.Now there is only one
 permanent ship.However today much     
 activity still goes on around the     
 harbour.This is because the sandy     
 beaches on either side attract        
 families from the local caravan sites 
 as well as day trippers from Belfast. 
 In addition the recent expansion of   
 the harbour has allowed many to keep  
 sailing boats and speed boats there.  </content>
