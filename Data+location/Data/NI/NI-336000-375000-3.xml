 PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED CHILDREN .THE  
 CHILDREN RANGE FROM 3 TO 16 YEARS.    
 THEY FIRST GO INTO THE NURSERY SCHOOL 
 WHERE THEY SPEND 2 YEARS OR MORE      
 DEPENDING ON HOW WELL THEY DEVELOP. IN
 THE NEXT STAGE THE CLASSES ARE THE    
 SAME AS IN ALL PRIMARY SCHOOLS,EXCEPT 
 THAT THE CHILDREN ARE SOMETIMES OLDER 
 BECAUSE OF SPENDING TIME IN HOSPITAL.

 CLASSES GO SWIMMING AND HORSERIDING.  
 SOME OF THE OLDER CLASSES GO CANOEING 
 AND HAVE ADVENTURE HOLIDAYS.DURING THE
 EASTER AND SUMMER TERMS ALL CLASSES   
 HAVE A VISIT TO MILLISLE WHERE        
 THE "BOAT HOUSE " IS SITUATED. THIS IS
 A HOLIDAY HOUSE THAT HAS BEEN ADAPTED 
 TO SUIT THE NEEDS OF DISABLED PEOPLE.
