		<title>19Cromore House Portstewart</title>
		<content> Cromore House was the family home of  
 the Cromie family,one of the most     
 influential families in the           
 Portstewart area until the early part 
 of this century.                      
  The original house dates from the mid
 18th century. in 1834 John Cromie     
 extended it.                          
 After lying in a state of disrepair   
 for some years it became a residence  
 for post-graduate students of the New 
 University of Ulster and was well     
 looked after and being restored.      
 However,it has recently come onto the 
 market and there is concern that it   
 may once again be allowed to fall into
 disrepair.                            
  The most impressive room in the house
 is the Hall which has often been used 
 as the setting for religious and      
 musical programmes by the television  
 companies in Northern Ireland.        </content>
