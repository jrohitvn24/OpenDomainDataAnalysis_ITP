 IN A HALL IN THE SQUARE IN THE EARLY  
 1930'S. RECENTLY THEY HAVE BUILT A NEW
 EXTENSION FOR THEIR SUNDAY SCHOOL.    
   THE BAPTIST CHURCH BEGAN IN A SMALL 
 WOODEN HALL IN THE 1960'S. A NEW      
 CHURCH HAS BEEN BUILT ON THE SAME     
 SITE. THIS OCCURRED IN EARLY 1984. THE
 REASON FOR THIS WAS BECAUSE OF THEIR  
 GROWING MEMBERSHIP.

 SCHOOL ROAD WHICH IS USED FOR         
 CHILDRENS' MEETINGS. THE DRUMLOUGH
