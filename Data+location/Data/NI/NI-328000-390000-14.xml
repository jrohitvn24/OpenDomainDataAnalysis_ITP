		<content>    There   is   a  {taxi  service  }in
 Ballyclare,run by a local family.  The
 car  for  the {taxi  service }is a red
 Sierra with  leather  seats.  The{taxi
{service}also has a mini bus.          
                                       
    The{bus station}in Ballyclare is on
 the Mill Road, which is at  the bottom
 of  the town. The fares are reasonably
 cheap. From Ballyclare to  Belfast the
 price  would  be  about 45p. A  return
 ticket  from  Ballyclare   to  Belfast
 would be about 80p.                   
                                       
    There   is   no {train  station }in
 Ballyclare. The   nearest   one  would
 be in Larne. Some   examples  of local
 train fares  are Â£1.50  from  Larne to
 Belfast and Belfast to Ballymena would
 be about Â£1.80.
