		<title>04WOODBURN ABBEY.</title>
		<content> The abbey of Goodborn or Woodborn,    
 took its name from the river          
 Woodburne; it was commonly known as   
 "St. Mary's Abbey."    It was founded 
 by John De Courcy, for the            
 Praemonstratensian monks (white       
 canons).   Four large carved stones   
 are preserved in St. Nicholas Church  
 in the centre of Carrickfergus.   The 
 abbey and its possessions were        
 surrendered to Henry V111 and taken   
 over by Sir Arthur Chichester in 1604.
 It is thought that the houses in the  
 Irish Quarter were built in the 17th  
 century with stones from the ruins.   
                                       
      Courtaulds factory was built on  
 part of the abbey.  The abbey is      
 believed to have connections with     
 Drieburgh in Scotland, which has Sir  
 Walter Scott buried in its ruins.
