		<content> ALTNAGELVIN HOSPITAL was opened in{   
{1959. It was built in an L SHAPE but  
{has recently been expanded }and it    
 serves a large area around {DERRY}.   
   A statue of {PRINCESS MACHA }stands 
 outside the hospital.  The story of   
{PRINCESS MACHA }is a legend .  She was
 the greatest runner in{ULSTER. }At    
 that time strangers came and ,to      
 impress them the {ULSTER} nobles      
 forced her to run against a horse.    
 Even though she was pregnant she was  
 still forced .  She managed to win the
 race but collapsed at the end.  The   
 women delivered two bouncing babies   
 but the effort killed {MACHA}.  With  
 her dying words she cursed the        
 noblemen of {ULSTER "When you most    
{need your strength you shall be as    
{weak as a dying woman ."
