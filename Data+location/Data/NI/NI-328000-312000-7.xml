		<content> THESE EVENTS ARE ORGANISED BY A       
 COMMITTEE COMPRISING REPRESENTATIVES  
 FROM THE LOCAL CLUBS AND              
 ORGANISATIONS.  THE COMMITTEE         
 ENCOURAGES THE PUBLIC TO COME FORWARD 
 WITH IDEAS FOR EVENTS AT THE FESTIVAL,
 AND APPRECIATE CONSTRUCTIVE COMMENTS  
 ON PREVIOUS YEAR'S EFFORTS.           
 IN ITS INAUGURAL YEAR THE TOTAL       
 NUMBER OF EVENTS WAS 30, THIS HAS NOW 
 RISEN TO OVER 100.  WHEN POSSIBLE THE 
 COMMITTEE TRY TO INVOLVE THE NATURAL  
 BEAUTY OF THE AREA IN THE FESTIVAL AND
 LAST YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, AN EXHIBITION 
 OF CARTOON PICTURES WAS PUT ON        
 DISPLAY AT THE SILENT VALLEY.         
 PUBLICITY IS A VERY IMPODRTANT FACTOR 
 TOWARDS THE SUCCESS OF THE FESTIVAL,  
 AND THIS YEAR AS WELL AS THE USUAL    
 PRESS COVERAGE, IT IS HOPED TO        
 DISTRIBUTE 5,000 PROGRAMMES           
 ADVERTISING THE VARIOUS EVENTS.       </content>
