		<title>13HEATING OUR HOMES</title>
		<content>                                       
 In our area the houses are heated by  
 various methods.{Coal}is the most     
 common fuel used and it is burned in  
 open fires or closed stoves. Some coal
 is smokeless, but very expensive. A   
 bag costs about Â£9 which is twice the 
 price of ordinary coal.{Peats}and{wood
 are also burned in these fires and    
 stoves.                               
{Oil}is another popular fuel but it is 
 expensive - a gallon costing about Â£1.
 The oil burns and heats water in a    
 boiler. The water is piped to         
 radiators all through the houses.     
 Some homes are heated by{electric }   
 storage heaters. Nearly everyone has  
 an electric fire which they can plug  
 in to get heat in a hurry.            
 All fuels used to heat the homes have 
 (with the exception of peat and wood) 
 to be imported.                       </content>
