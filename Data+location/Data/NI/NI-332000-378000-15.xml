 steals their eggs.There are many      
 paths leading to the top of Cave      
 Hill.On a Sunday many people enjoy    
 walks on the hillside. From the top of
 Cave Hill there are marvellous views  
 of the city of Belfast and Belfast

 model toys.In autumn the view of Cave 
 HILL is a truely marvellous sight.
