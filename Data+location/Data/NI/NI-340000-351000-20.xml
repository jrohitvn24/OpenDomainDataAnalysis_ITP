		<content> I took a survey of our classrooms     
 hobbies.In my survey I found that     
 quite a lot of people liked to collect
 odds and ends.I also found out that   
 three people in our class had home    
 computers.Mark Watson has an Amstrad  
 and a joystick.Alan Spratt has a      
 Dragon 32 and a joystick.My computer  
 is a Spectrum and it is small and     
 black and has rubber keys.It has a 48k
 memory and has a medium power voltage.
 I also have an interface as well.The  
 computer itself is quite powerful and 
 is quite capable of doing business    
 accounts.Six people in the room have  
 no hobbies at all and two really enjoy
 collecting Brittans farm machinery.
