		<content> Today is June 3rd 1985.I rose at      
 7.30am and made my bed.I dressed in a 
 light blue and white top and a pair of
 cotton trousers.Now breakfast time.   
 First I had a glass of pure orange    
 then a small bowl of Frosties,a cup of
 tea and a slice of toast with butter  
 and marmalade.I washed with Fairy soap
 and brushed my teeth with Crest       
 toothpaste.                           
   I rode to school on my bike.The     
 first person I met was Tommy the      
 school patrolman.At 8.30am I went     
 straight to the cloakroom to change my
 shoes.There I met Peter the caretaker.
 Off to the classroom I went got my    
 books out waited for my friends to    
 come in.At 9.00am MRS.McCAUL,my       
 teacher came in and we started our    
 work.
