		<content>   The 2nd Broughshane Presbyterian    
 Church was ready for use in 1861,and  
 was built because the first church was
 too small.A new manse was also built  
 and was not finished until 1872.The{  
{Rev.Armstrong}is the tenth minister in
 the church,and took over in 1971.In   
 1939 when the new church hall was     
 erected,it was used by the army at the
 beginning of the{Second World War.}   
   When the extension was added to the 
 hall in 1975 it was used even more    
 than before,especially by such        
 organisations as the bowling          
 club,badminton club,girls' brigade,   
 boys' brigade,Junior Christian        
 Endeavour and P.W.A.                  
   A service is held in the church     
 weekly at 12.00 noon and on alternate 
 Sundays at 6.00 p.m. Also the church  
 is proud to be the owners of two      
 beautiful{stained glass windows.}     </content>
