		<title>13Enniskillen County Hospital</title>
		<content>   The County Hospital at Breandrum was
 begun in 1817 and completed in 1821.  
 It was paid for and run by private    
 donation and in 1836 it cost Â£1,400   
 per year. In 1896 it was taken over by
 the County Council and a year later an
 extension fund was started by Dr.Kidd.
 Over the next 30 years many           
 improvements were carried out         
 including the installation of an X-ray
 machine and an Ultra Violet Unit in   
 1928. All this was paid for by fund   
 raising and donation. In 1949 it was  
 taken over by the state and in 1964   
 the new Erne Hospital was opened on   
 the site of the Workhouse. The County 
 has since become the main geriatric   
 hospital for Fermanagh area.
