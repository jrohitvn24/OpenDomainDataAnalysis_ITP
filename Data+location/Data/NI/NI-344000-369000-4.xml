		<title>04Farming - Interview</title>
		<content>  We interviewed a farmer,Mr Hamilton  
 who is also a councillor and farms    
 mostly vegetables.He lives in a large 
 house with a beautiful garden and has 
 pet peacocks,cockerels and pheasants. 
 He has 150 acres of land.His farm is  
 on reclaimed land and for generations 
 his family have farmed there          
 successfully.He employs 3 permanent   
 workers and in the summer he employs 7
 or 8 to help him with his harvesting. 
  The main threat to his farming is    
 world-wide competition and also big   
 business syndicates buying land for   
 leisure purposes such as shooting,    
 fishing and riding centres.           
  He is interested in conservation and 
 also in wildlife preservation where   
 possible,but he says butterflies and  
 rabbits can destroy his cabbages.     
  His future plans are to give his land
 a rest and change to livestock farming</content>
