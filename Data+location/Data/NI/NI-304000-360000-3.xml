		<content>  Kinnegoe Marine is situated on the   
 east side of Kinnegoe Harbour.It is   
 built on reclaimed land on a site of  
 about twenty five acres.              
  Groups,mainly schools and youth      
 organisations,use the facilities      
 extensively.Individuals can also use  
 them for a small charge.Tuition is    
 given in all the different activities.
  A wall has been built out into the   
 Lough to prevent the water from       
 becoming rough and damaging the boats 
 moored to the jetties.                
  Shops on the site cater for the      
 various needs of water sports.There is
 one which sells boats and surf-boards,
 while a chandlery answers the need for
 different boating equipment.          
  A slipway has been built from which  
 craft can be launched,and on fine     
 summer evenings the area is extremely 
 busy.                                 </content>
