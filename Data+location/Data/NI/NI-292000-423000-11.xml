		<content> In{school}classes commence at 9.10am.,
 after {assembly}. Each class lasts for
 35 minutes unless we have a double    
 period. In Form 1 and 2 we have a set 
 timetable, but from Form 3 we have to 
 choose optional subjects as well as   
 our compulsories. Break occurs at the 
 end of the fourth period at 11.30am.  
 when we can buy items from the {Tuck  
{shop}which is run by the sixth form.  
                                       
 There are two classes before          
 lunchtime,which is at 12.55pm. Lunch  
 is served in the dining hall or if    
 preferred a packed-lunch can be eaten.
 Classes recommence at 1.45pm. and     
 school ends at 3.30pm.,although some  
 pupils leave ten minutes early for    
 transport reasons. We are given early 
 and late passes at the beginning of   
 each school where necessary.
