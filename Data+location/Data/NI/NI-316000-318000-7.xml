		<content> MY daddy is a pilot. He gets up and   
 has breakfast. After breakfast he     
 rings the air-port to say he is       
 leaving. He has a two hour journey    
 because we live seventy miles from    
 Dublin airport. When he is at the     
 airport he looks at the weather maps. 
 Next he finds out which aeroplane he  
 is flying. He gets a black case with  
 all the maps and goes to the aeroplane
 an hour before take-off. He flies to  
 Shannon and has a stop there and stays
 for an hour before flying to Boston   
 and on to New York. He rests there one
 night and flies back to Dublin via    
 Boston and Shannon.                   
 He comes home and sleeps because he   
 has flown through the night.          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
