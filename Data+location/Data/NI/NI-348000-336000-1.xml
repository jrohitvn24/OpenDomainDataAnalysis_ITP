		<title>01SURVEY AREA</title>
		<content> This area includes the town lands of  
 Minerstown,Ballynagallagh,Ballyvaston,
 Bright,Lisoid and parts of            
 Rathmullan,Ballydargan,Ballylig       
 ,Ballygilbert,Rossglass,Carrowbane and
 Whigamstown.                          
 The area is hilly, covered with       
 drumlins,marshy areas and small       
 streams are found in the hollows      
 between the drumlins.                 
 The only really high ground in the    
 area is Carrowbane Mountain which     
 rises to a height of just over 70m    
 above sea level.                      
  The land falls away steeply on three 
 sides from Carrowbane giving it a     
 commanding view of the area.It was    
 probably for this reason that Bright  
 townland on top of Carrowbane was an  
 important ancient  settlement site.
