		<title>02ST. CIARANS HIGH SCHOOL 1</title>
		<content> The school and parish are named after 
 an early Irish saint who founded the  
 church and monastery at Errigal. St.  
 Ciarans serves the parishes of Errigal
 Ciaran, Clogher, Aghaloo, Eskra and   
 Aughentaine. Most of the school       
 catchment area is in the Southern     
 Education and Library board area.     
    St. Ciarans was opened in 1966 and 
 has developed rapidly in recent years,
 both in teaching staff and classrooms.
 As well as eighteen permanent         
 classrooms, there are two C.D.T. rooms
 and thirteen mobile classrooms. We    
 also have a grass football pitch, an  
 all-weather pitch and four tennis     
 courts. In addition, an extension to  
 the school including a second         
 gymnasium has been approved and will  
 soon be started.
