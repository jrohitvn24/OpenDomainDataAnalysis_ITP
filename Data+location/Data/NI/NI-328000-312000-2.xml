		<content> FISHING IS A VERY IMPORTANT INDUSTRY  
 IN KILKEEL. MANY PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED, 
 NOT ONLY AS FISHERMEN, BUT IN THE     
 FACTORIES AT THE HARBOUR WHERE THE    
 FISH AND PRAWNS ARE PROCESSED.        
 ALTHOUGH WORKING CONDITIONS FOR THE   
 FISHERMEN HAVE IMPROVED OVER THE YEARS
 WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF MECHANISATION
 ON MANY BOATS, THE HOURS ARE STILL    
 LONG AND IRREGULAR. AT PRESENT THERE  
 ARE ALMOST 100 BOATS IN THE FLEET AND 
 THESE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO FOUR        
 CATEGORIES.                           
 THE SMALLEST TYPE IS A SKIFF. IN THE  
 LARGEST OF THESE A CREW OF FOUR,      
 INCLUDING THE SKIPPER IS NEEDED AND   
 THEY ONLY FISH FOR AT THE MOST SIX    
 WEEKS IN A YEAR DEPENDING ON THE      
 WEIGHT OF HERRING THEY ARE PERMITED TO
 CATCH.                                
 A PELAGIC FISHING BOAT MEASURES       
 BETWEEN 60 AND 80 FEET LONG.          </content>
