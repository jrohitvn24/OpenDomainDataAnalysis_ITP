		<content> On a typical Thursday morning daddy   
 gets up at seven o'clock to feed his  
 cattle.David and I usually get up at  
 the same time.We get dressed quickly  
 and at about eight o'clock my mummy   
 and little brother get up.For the next
 three quarters of an hour David and I 
 either watch TV or ride our bikes.At  
{8:45}my dad comes back from feeding   
 his cattle and is in a rush to get his
 breakfast to be ready for work.Daddy  
 leaves at nine o'clock and mummy runs 
 us to school in the car.After school  
 mummy comes to collect us and we go to
 Crossgar to shop.We come back at about
{4:30}and do our homework.We have our  
 tea at {5:30}.Dad feeds his cattle    
 again after tea and we watch          
 television until eight o'clock and    
 then we go to bed.
