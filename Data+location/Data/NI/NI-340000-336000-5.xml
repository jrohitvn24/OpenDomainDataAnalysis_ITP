		<content> Other species include many trees and  
 shrubs and some freshwater and wetland
 plants.The area has a very wide       
 variety of habitats including a small 
 cliff of shale (blasted to allow the  
 railway through).Sensitive management 
 is producing a very valuable Reserve. 
 In Dundrum itself, the old two-storey 
 railway sheds have been converted into
 single storey warehouses.             
 At the end of the old railway, Dundrum
 pier is almost completely disused as a
 pier; the last boat offloaded coal    
 this year. The pier buildings are     
 still used as a warehouse and showroom
 for fireplaces and heating supplies;  
 an occasional visiting yacht might tie
 up briefly and the pier is increasing-
 ly being used as a base for wind-     
 surfers in the Inner Bay who take     
 advantage of the extensive shallow    
 water at high tide.                   </content>
