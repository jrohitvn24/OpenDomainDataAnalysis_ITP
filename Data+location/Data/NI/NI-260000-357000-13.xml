		<title>13GORMLEY'S ENGINEERING WORKS</title>
		<content> There are four small industries in our
 area,two engineering works,a          
 concrete products industry and a      
 joinery firm. We visited Harry        
 Gormley's Engineering company. One of 
 the workers showed us around. First of
 all we saw the computerised bending   
 machine. There was a piece of steel in
 it and the power for bending it was   
 150 tons.We saw a man spraying a      
 forklift.At present they are making a 
 boat for use on Lough Erne.It is for a
 man who wants to bring stones across  
 the Lough.There are 20 employees.There
 are two lorries. They have six        
 forklifts.They  only make products    
 of steel.We saw the lathes            
 working.Some of the things they make  
 are yardscrapers,transport boxes,     
 land-rollers, buckrakes and           
 loaders.They are sold in every county 
 in Ireland.                           </content>
