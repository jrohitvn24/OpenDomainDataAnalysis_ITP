 "D-block".The stone quarried is{      
{whinstone}and is mostly used for road 
 building and foundations.There is an  
 associated cement block works nearby. 
  The other{industry}in the area is    
 confined to the Derriaghy area and is 
 mostly concerned with distributive    
 warehousing and light industry.Many of
 the factories that used to occupy

 1980's.

 worked at the ill-fated{De Lorean}car 
 factory which was sited within 200m of
 the north-east corner of this         
 "d-block".This government backed
