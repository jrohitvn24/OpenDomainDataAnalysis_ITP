		<title>11Paper Factory,Lurgan</title>
		<content>  The paper factory is situated at     
 Annesborough Estate,Lurgan.It is one  
 of the biggest factories on the       
 Estate.                               
  The paper is bought in England,and   
 the factory change it into cardboard  
 using a corrugating machine.          
  The cardboard is used to make boxes  
 of different shapes and sizes.        
  Modern machinery has increased the   
 capacity for production,although this 
 can be at the expense of employment.  
  Some other box-making firms do not   
 have the machinery to make their own  
 cardboard,so they are supplied with it
 by the factory.                       
  The majority of boxes are made for   
 the food and drink trade,who use the  
 boxes to package their products.      
  Together with a sister factory in    
 Dublin,they sell throughout Ireland.
