		<content>  Waterside House is a residential     
 hostel situated beside Kinnegoe Marina
 and overlooking Lough Neagh.          
  Groups of about thirty can be        
 accommodated here in considerable     
 comfort.                              
  The House is used mainly by youth    
 organisations,who can use the         
 surroundings to partake in many       
 activities.                           
  The nature of the area attracts a    
 very wide variety of animals,many of  
 them quite rare,and the development of
 the area provides many facilities to  
 study them at close range.            
  Help in the study of the area is     
 given by guides who work there.       
  Groups staying at the House can also 
 take part in the many sports available
 and can obtain qualified instruction  
 in each.
