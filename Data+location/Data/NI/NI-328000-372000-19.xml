		<title>19"Troubles", a Child's View</title>
		<content> It was the{summer of 1983}and we had  
 just been given the summer break from 
 school.We were playing, when suddenly 
 we heard a loud bang.When we asked the
 youth leader what it was, he wouldn't 
 tell us.We were told not to go out,   
 but we went out to play{"Two Balls"}on
 the wall.My ball dropped and it went  
 over to a fence.I was picking it up   
 when I saw bits of glass all over the 
 road. There were pieces of metal and  
{wreckage}everywhere! A delivery van   
 belonging to a local supermarket had  
 been{blown up.}My cousin Nuala and I  
 ran in and told the leader. By this   
 time everyone was crying because they 
 had heard about the{bomb.}I couldn't  
 get home so I had to go down to my    
 granny's house.Later, when everything 
 was calm I got a lift home in my      
 aunt's car. Luckily, only slight      
{injuries}were caused by this bomb.    </content>
