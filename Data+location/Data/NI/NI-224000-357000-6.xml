		<content> We saw the old offices which were     
 going to be storage places.  The new  
 offices were well built and were      
 mostly made of wood.  We were in the  
 offices and saw some equipment which  
 could send messages to Africa and     
 other countries just by the touch of a
 button.                               
       Then we went outside to see  the
 garages and meet the garage-men.  To  
 finish our lovely trip to Reihill-Mc  
 Keowns, Gerry Mc Nulty was very kind  
 and gave us all a glass of orange     
 each.
