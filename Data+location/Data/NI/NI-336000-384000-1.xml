		<title>01INTRODUCTION TO GREENISLAND</title>
		<content>  Between{'the hill'}(KNOCKAGH)to the  
 north and{'the shore'}(BELFAST LOUGH) 
 2km to the south lies the community of
{Greenisland.                          
  The road system around which it has  
 grown is in the form of a capital{'H' 
 The central road running N_S is       
 Station Road and if you want to find  
 the heart of Greenisland you must go  
 to the {railway station.}The district 
 may owe its name to a small grassy    
 island nearby,but the existence of a {
{community of 6000 people}is due to the
 building of the railway.              
  But there really is no heart.It was  
 built bit by bit to supply housing for
{Belfast's overflow population}and for 
 new local industries.People eat and   
 sleep there but work and play         
 elsewhere.Yet it is a green and       
 pleasant place and loved by those who 
 live on its gentle slopes.            </content>
