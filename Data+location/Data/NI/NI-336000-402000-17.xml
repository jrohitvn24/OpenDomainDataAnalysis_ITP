		<title>17THE LARNE HISTORICAL CENTRE</title>
		<content> In the early Seventies a collection of
{archive material}including{photographs
 was  assembled and now has a permanent
 home in the{Carnegie Arts Centre. }The
 recreation of a  country house kitchen
 from the  beginning of the  century is
 complete with an open hearth crane and
 griddle. The dresser is filled with an
 array of cups and plates.             
                                       
 There is a blacksmith's forge with all
 his tools.  Around it are agricultural
 instruments used over eighty years ago
                                       
 There is display of photographs of the
 town and  district and the  faces from
 the past.   This Historical Centre was
 largely the creation of {John Clifford
 historian, writer &amp; actor and remains 
 a tribute to his memory.
