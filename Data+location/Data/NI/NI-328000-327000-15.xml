		<content> The area is on the North side of the  
 Mournes. This is in the rain shadow   
 from the prevailing SW winds but is   
 affected by the orographic rainfall   
 associated with the Mournes.          
 Rainfall varies from over 1800 mm per 
 year on the tops of the mountains to  
 under 1600 mm per year at Fofanny     
 reservoir.                            
 The variation in temperature is       
 perhaps best exemplified by the       
 varying lengths of the growing season 
 (number of days per year with average 
 temperatures above 5.6 deg (Cent)).   
 The mountain tops have 240 such days  
 and the valleys have 260 such days.   
 The exposed mountain tops are         
 obviously the windiest but the flat   
 area South of Fofanny reservoir has a 
 reputation for high winds and extreme 
 gustiness.                            
                                       </content>
