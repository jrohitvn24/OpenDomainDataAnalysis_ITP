		<content>  Mr Noble is an old gentleman who has 
 lived in the area for all his life,82 
 years to be precise.Mr Noble used to  
 be a surveyor and he told us some very
 useful information about the area.We  
 were told that all the names in this  
 area were  Gaelic,for example         
 Boghill whose original gaelic name was
 Bauchill,which means cowherd.There was
 also Mullusk,now Mallusk meaning{"The 
{Plain Of The Congregation"}.          
  Mr Noble discribed the Boghill stone,
 this is a stone that lies at the top  
 of Boghill hill.From this stone you   
 can see all five counties in          
 N.Ireland, excluding Fermanagh.Mr     
 Noble's family has lived in Roughfort 
 for many generations,in fact he could 
 even tell us that his great,great     
 ,grandmother had lived in the house   
 next to his caravan.
