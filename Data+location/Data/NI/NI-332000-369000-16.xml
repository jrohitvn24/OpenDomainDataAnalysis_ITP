		<content>{    Nazareth Lodge}is a home for      
 children which has existed in the area
 since 1899. It is run by the{Sisters  
{of Nazareth.}For many years it catered
 for Boys only. At first it was used as
 an industrial school and a home for   
 orphans. In 1984 the sisters took care
 of babies, and this was continued     
 until the year 1953, when a nearby    
 baby home was opened. The boys when   
 they reached the age of 11 were       
 formally transferred to a{residential 
{school}at{Kircubbin.}Nowadays the     
 children stay at{Nazareth Lodge}until 
 the age of about 16. It was not until 
 the year 1967 that girls were first   
 admitted and since then children are  
 reared in{"family"}groups. At present 
 there are three groups with numbers   
 varying between 11 and 14 children in 
 each group.                           
                                       </content>
