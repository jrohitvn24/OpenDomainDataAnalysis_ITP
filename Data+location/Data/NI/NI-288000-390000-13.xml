		<title>13SHOPPING</title>
		<content> Magherafelt has twenty-six food shops 
 and sixty-six non-food shops.The      
 largest shop in Magherafelt is        
 Cuddy's,a department store which sells
 household goods,ladies',gent's and    
 children's clothes,fancy goods and    
 toys.                                 
    The majority of shops are near the 
 town centre in Rainey Street,Broad    
 Street,Queen's Street,Church Street   
 and Market Square.A wide range of     
 goods can be purchased in the         
 town,many shoppers come in from the   
 surrounding townlands and villages,not
 only for their weekly purchases but   
 also for major items such as furniture
 or clothing.                          
    Some grocers still take a van      
 around the country areas,but this     
 practice is not nearly as common as it
 was a number of years ago because most
 families have their own transport.    </content>
