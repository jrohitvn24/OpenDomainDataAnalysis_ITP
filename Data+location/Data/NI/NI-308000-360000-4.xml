		<content>   Siul Fada is the Irish for "Long    
 Walk". It is a sponsored walk held    
 every year in June and the money      
 collected goes to help children learn 
 Irish. The children are helped to go  
 to the Gaeltacht which is an          
 Irish-speaking district in Donegal.   
   I went on the walk this year. We    
 walked from Lurgan out to Lough Neagh.
 We had a picnic there. We got a bag of
 crisps, a  can of lemonade, a         
 bandit and a Penguin. We stayed at    
 Castor's Bay for about twenty minutes 
 and then we started off for home. We  
 went down an old dirt track and then  
 on to the Annesborough Rd. It took us 
 about an hour and a half to get back  
 to Lurgan. We got our cards signed to 
 show that we had completed the walk   
 and then we went home. Next day I was 
 very tired and my feet were sore.
