		<title>15Country Roads,   Randalstown</title>
		<content> In total there are twelve roads       
 throughout the area. Four are'B'class 
 roads: Portglenone, Ahoghill, Roguery 
 and Whitesides Roads. To the east the 
 Caddy road is class 'C', while the    
 others are narrow minor roads.        
 Numerous laneways lead off these to   
 the farmhouses.                       
 The average width of the 'B' roads is 
 7 meters , while the smaller roads    
 average only 3.5 meters.  Maintenance 
 of these is carried out by the Dept.of
 the Environment, and is paid for by   
 the local district council.           
 The smaller roads are geneally in poor
 condition ,with lots of potholes and  
 areas where the tarmac has been broken
 up. However these roads are mainly    
 only used by local people and farmers 
 tending their land. In many places it 
 is difficult for two vehicles to pass 
 safely. Hedgerows also hinder vision. </content>
