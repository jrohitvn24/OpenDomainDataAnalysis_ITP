		<content> THE SPES MAGNA IS 112 FEET IN LENGTH  
 AND CAN HOLD 300 TONNES OF FISH.      
 TWELVE THOUSAND GALLONS OF DIESEL ARE 
 KEPT ON BOARD AND IT USES 50 GALLONS  
 EVERY HOUR.  IN JULY EACH YEAR THESE  
 BOATS SAIL TO THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND   
 AND SPEND THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS       
 FISHING IN THE NORTH SEA CATCHING     
 MAINLY MACKEREL AND HERRING.  THEY    
 FISH FOR THREE TO FOUR DAYS AT A TIME 
 THEN DOCK TO UNLOAD THEIR CATCH ONTO A
 FACTORY SHIP AND TAKE ON BOARD FRESH  
 SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND OIL.  WHERE THEY 
 DOCK DEPENDS ON WHERE THEY ARE        
 FISHING.  FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE WEST    
 COAST THEY USE$ EITHER MALLAIG OR     
 ULLAPOOL.  FURTHER NORTH THEY WOULD   
 DOCK AT STORNAWAY AND IF THEY ARE ON  
 THE EAST COAST THE PORT OF FRASERBURGH
 IS USED.  THE CREW OF THE SPES MAGNA  
 CONSISTS OF 12 MEN,                   
                                       </content>
