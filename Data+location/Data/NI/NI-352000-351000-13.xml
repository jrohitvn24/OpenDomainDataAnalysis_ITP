		<title>13Social Life in Killyleagh.</title>
		<content> Like most small towns Killyleagh has  
 many clubs run by local people.These  
 include church based organisations    
 such as the Boy's Brigade, the Girl's 
 Brigade, Scouts and Youth Clubs.For   
 older people they run the indoor      
 bowling club. There is an active      
 Women's Institute,Keep-fit club and   
 Wildfowlers Association. A new club   
 has also been estasblished to provise 
 a venue for the new craze of          
 Break-Dancing.                        
 Perhaps the most successful club in   
 the town this year was the Killyleagh 
 Football club which won the Amateur   
 League and the AIB Border Cup which   
 dates back to the First World War.    
  Despite this seemingly wide choice of
 clubs many young people in the town   
 feel that there is still inadequate   
 sporting facilities for them in 1985.
