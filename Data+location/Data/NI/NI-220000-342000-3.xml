		<content>{ENNISKILLEN or INNISKILLING,}the name 
 of the island,is also the name of a   
 famous Irish regiment.The town was    
 founded in 1608 by Captain William    
 Cole.The old castle,which still       
 remains in part,was a{MAGUIRE  }      
 stronghold,but there was no town      
 until the{PROTESTANT PLANTATION.}In   
 1705 a fire destroyed over 80 houses  
 which were rebuilt.By the{GEORGIAN}  }
 period the town had extended beyond   
 the island.{VICTORIAN}building tended 
 to concentrate to the N.and E.with a  
 workhouse,railway and prison.The{20th 
{century}has covered the surrounding   
 hillsides with housing estates and    
 added three more bridges with another 
 one planned.The hilly landscape was   
 suitable for defence purposes with the
 West defended by the"Redoubt"(built   
 1796 a square fort)and the East by    
 the"Forthill"(built 1689 an earthfort)</content>
