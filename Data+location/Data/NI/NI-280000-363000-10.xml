		<content> Twenty years ago in 1965{Powerscreen} 
 was born.Two local men Lee Mallaghan  
 and Pat O'Neill founded it.The site   
 chosen was in Edendork at Gilmores    
 crossroads.The first machine the firm 
 produced was called a{Mark 1.}This is 
 a screening machine which sorts sand  
 from gravel on a powerful level.      
 Business became so successful that{   
{Mark 1}was followed by four more      
 screening machines.                   
   With the expansion in production    
 more space was required.In 1975 a new 
 factory was built opposite our school.
 The engineers developed 3 conveyor    
 machines,the{M60,M80,M100}.           
   Interestingly enough we discovered  
 that the materials required to produce
 these giant steel monsters were       
 imported from England and Wales.Only  
 the labour came from Co.Tyrone.
