		<title>12The Creamery (2)</title>
		<content>  The butter comes out of a pipe at the
 top of a machine and goes through a   
 pipe and into cardboard boxes lined   
 with green plastic.The boxes are      
 stacked on wooden pallets, put on a   
 lorry and sent to Belfast, where they 
 are put into deep freeze. Later they  
 are packed for sale in shops.         
   The whey goes to another building.It
 is dried out and made into {casein}for
 export, mainly to America to be used  
 as a food additive. The types of {    
{casein}are{rennet}and{acid.           
   The creamery was established in     
 1965.This area was chosen because it  
 was central to the milk catchment     
 area. About 24 people are employed    
 here. They provide milk in various    
 forms- fresh milk in cartons and      
 bottles, skimmed milk, buttermilk,    
 butter, cheese and casein. A new Farm 
 Service  section opened recently.     </content>
