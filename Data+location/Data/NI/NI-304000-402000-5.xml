		<title>05REARING PIGS</title>
		<content>  Sows arrive in the farrowing pens    
 three days before their piglets are   
 born and remain there, throughout     
 weaning, approximately four and a half
 weeks. During weaning the sows are fed
 double rations - about ten pounds of  
 barley and soya (from North Antrim    
 Mills, Dervock) with vitamins and     
 minerals and skimmed milk (from       
 Diomona Creamery).                    
  After weaning the piglets are moved  
 to the flat decks where they remain   
 until they weigh about eighty pounds. 
 At this weight the piglets are        
 transferred to the fattening houses,  
 they are fed four and a half pounds of
 meal per day until they are two       
 hundred pounds weight and about twenty
 one weeks old. These piglets are then 
 sent to the local pork processing     
 factory in Cullybackey. On average    
 thirty three pigs are sold each week. </content>
