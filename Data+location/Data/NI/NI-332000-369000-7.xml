		<content>     Having completed a survey of      
 90-100 people we found that{44%       
 admitted to reading their horoscopes  
 ;of these the majority were women.    
 Horoscopes were taken out of media    
 sources.{33%}of those who answered the
 survey said they were superstitious   
 believing more in old wives tales such
 as black cats, walking under ladders  
 etc.than in lucky charms, including-  
 horse-shoes, four leaved clovers and  
 Rabbits' paws. Some people living in  
 the area studied said that they had   
 experienced poltergeists either in    
 their own homes or in a graveyard.Some
 also agreed that television coverage  
 had helped to calm any fear of these  
 presences. People have gradually come 
 to accept strange phenomena such as   
 mind over matter i.e. willing objects 
 to move and "Gifted" people who can   
 see into the future.                  </content>
