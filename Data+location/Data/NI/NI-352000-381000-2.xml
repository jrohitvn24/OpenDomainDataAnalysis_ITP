		<content> We interviewed a man called           
 Mr.Watterson,one of the oldest people 
 living in Groomsport.He has lived     
 there since 1911,the year he was      
 born.He told us about life from World 
 War 1 until the present day           
     The Primary School he attended is 
 now the church hall (Maxwell Hall).   
 When it was a school,there was a      
 portable partition which divided the  
 room in two.There were only 2 teachers
 and 70 pupils.                        
     After the war when he was only    
 9,the population of the village was   
 about 400 people.The Parish Church was
 completed in 1842 and life was much   
 slower in those days.The population   
 today is about 4000.                  
     During World War 2 many villagers 
 joined the Army and fishing stopped   
 completely.There was only one shop in 
 the village then.                     </content>
