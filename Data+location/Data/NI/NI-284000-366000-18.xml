		<title>18LIVING IN COALISLAND.</title>
		<content> We like living in {COALISLAND. }That  
 is what we realised as we worked on   
 the {DOMESDAY PROJECT.}Our area has a 
 very good community spirit and more   
 facilities than we had realised. Most 
 of the boys from the area who attend  
 our school in Dungannon belong to a   
 club in{Coalisland or Clonoe.}When we 
 talked to people on the streets of    
{Coalisland}we found that they would   
 not like to live anywhere else, indeed
 many had come home after years of     
 working in England. The only complaint
 that most people voiced was about the 
 traffic problem and the lack of jobs. 
 Unemployment is very high in the area 
 especially among young people. There  
 is a very strong community spirit in {
{Coalisland,}everyone tends ro know    
 everyone else and to help out when    
 they can. Few people move from the    
 area, not even 4 miles to Dungannon   </content>
