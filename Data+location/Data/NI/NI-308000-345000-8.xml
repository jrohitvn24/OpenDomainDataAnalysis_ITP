 tested on the farm and collected by   
 tankers each day.                     
      The farmer has to have good      
 grazing for h is cows so that they    
 have a good milk yield.  This means   
 they have to have large amounts of    
 fertilizer to sow on the grss to      
 enrich it.  As the fertilizer is so   
 expensive the farmer uses an electric 
 fencer to extensive graze his herd.   
      {Hay}and{Silage}are used to feed 
 the cows in winter as well as the meal
 when kept indoors.                    
       The farmers day will begin at   
 6.30am.  He has to work hard and      
 sometimes long hours.  He has  a full 
 time job looking after the calves and 
 other animals on his farm.
