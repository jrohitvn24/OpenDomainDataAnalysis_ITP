		<content> dinnertime.                           
  In our school you have a choice of   
 bringing a packed lunch, going home,  
 taking school dinner or going to the  
 cafeteria. I took cafeteria lunch.    
  After our second period of Maths we  
 went to Games. As the weather was good
 we went to the beach for a swim.      
  Although school ends at 3.30 p.m. our
 bus does not come until 4.10 p.m. When
 I got home I went up to the local     
 football pitches to watch a match     
 between Carginagh and Ballyveagh.     
  After tea I had a shower and got     
 dressed to go out to the cinema to see
 "Breakdance II". When the film        
 finished my friends and I went to the 
 "Chicken Villa" for a gravy chip. We  
 ate these as we walked round the      
 harbour before going home to bed.
