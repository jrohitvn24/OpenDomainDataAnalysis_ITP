		<title>17LEISURE IN THE AREA</title>
		<content> There are only a few leisure          
 facilities in the area.These include, 
 at St. Ciarans high school the three  
 football pitches, four tennis courts  
 and a gymnasium. There are also       
 snooker tables, darts etc.            
    We interviewed numerous people and 
 got their views on local leisure      
 facilities. They generally complained 
 about the lack of facilities but the  
 younger generation did make use of the
 facilities available at the school in 
 their spare time. The main leisure    
 activity of the older generation was  
 going to the pub.                     
    There is a few facilities for the  
 youth in the town, such as a pool     
 room, and a snooker room. For the     
 younger of the children, there is a   
 playpark with three football pitches.
