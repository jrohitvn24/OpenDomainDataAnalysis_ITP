		<title>09THE FLAGSTAFF WALK</title>
		<content> The Flagstaff Walk is an annual event 
 organised as part of the Newry Canal  
 Festival.  Although called the        
 Flagstaff Walk, the 12 mile route     
 centres around Fathom Mountain and    
 does not go quite as far as the       
 Flagstaff.  It takes place in June and
 hundreds of people walk the distance  
 to raise money for charity.  The      
 starting point is in Newry and from   
 here the participants go up the Dublin
 Rd. as far as Dromalane and they      
 follow the path of the canal.  A      
 little side road takes the walkers to 
 the bottom of Fathom mountain which   
 they climb.  They finally come out by 
 Killeen Bridge and make their way back
 down the Dublin Rd. to the finishing  
 post.  There are trophies for the     
 winners but it is emphasised that the 
 competitors must not run.
