		<title>02FARMING</title>
		<content> Farming is almost exclusively         
 livestock and varies from animals kept
 on rough grazing to animals fed on    
 silage .                              
         To the west holdings and      
 fields are smaller in size and bounded
 by tradilional hedging . The land here
 is almost all given to rough grazing, 
 with a fair proportion of much rougher
 and wetter land.                      
             To the east holdings are  
 large in size with consequently larger
 fields necessary to facilitate modern 
 farm machinery.Access roads through   
 fields have also had to be laid to    
 cope with the machinery.              
             Here the land has been    
 improved for grazing with stones      
 picked off,some marshy parts drained  
 bracken cleared and fertiliser added  
 .Grass for silage,winter fodder for   
 cattle,is most common.                </content>
