		<content> Within this block there is an unusual 
 feature.  Built on the old railway    
 house site, which was situated halfway
 between Newry and Warrenpoint, there  
 now stands a modern bungalow.  This is
 the only house to be found on the mud 
 flat side of the dual carriageway.    
 Initially this was a very small site  
 but over the years its area has grown 
 due to the ingenuity of the owner.  By
 tarmacing over the rubbish and then by
 dumping top soil and sowing grass the 
 site has gradually increased.  The    
 increase in its area has doubled its  
 value.  The new bungalow is completely
 surrounded by a garden and shrubs.    
 The site also houses a greenhouse and 
 a workshed.  There is a mooring post  
 to the right of the island which is no
 longer in use.
