		<title>04PIG FARM BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>  Mr McKeown's farm yard contains his  
 dwelling house and fourteen           
 outbuildings. The farmhouse was built 
 about 95 years ago of local stone and 
 lime and was originally thatched. Now 
 it is pebble dashed with a slate roof.
  The largest outhouses are the        
 harrowing house, part of which is used
 for wintering cattle, and the         
 fattening houses. The other houses are
 used as rearing houses or for         
 accommodating boars and sows after    
 suckling, all of these have slatted   
 concrete floors and fan ventilation.  
 The flat decks where piglets stay     
 untill ready for fattening have       
 perforated steel floors. There is a   
 Solarai House which is naturally      
 ventilated and is a general purpose   
 building. Other buildings are the     
 garage and machine shop, grain silos  
 and the skimmed milk tank.            </content>
