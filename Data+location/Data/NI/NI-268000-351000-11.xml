		<title>11Fishing</title>
		<content>  {Fishing}is a popular sport in our   
 area.  There is a lough out near      
{Rehaghy Mountain}called the{White     
{Lough. }It has a good big car park    
 just off the road.                    
   The Lough is quite small and has a  
 walk around it.  There are rushes     
 around the edge and piers so that     
 fishermen can get out of the rushes to
 cast their bait.                      
   You need to have a few{hooks and    
{spinners}with you. Spinners are hooks 
 that spin in the water like a fish    
 swimming and attract bigger fish to   
 eat them.  Bait that you would need to
 have are worms and maggots.  You need 
 to have a net to catch the fish when  
 you get them to edge of the pier.     
   When I get the fish home I get them 
 gutted and eat them.  You need a      
 licence to fish if you are an adult.
