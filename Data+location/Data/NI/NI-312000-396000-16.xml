 It was started around 1800.At the     
 factory all sorts of wool is done like
 for suits and rugs.First it comes to  
 the factory in bails then it's sent to
 the carding then it is spun into yarn 
 then it goes to the winding.There it  
 is dyed and then its sent to be warped
 then it goes to the drawing in.Next   
 it goes into the weaving which makes  
 it into material and it goes to the   
 darner who darnes the faults.When they
 finish it goes to the wash house and  
 after it's washed it goes to the      
 dryers.Then it's sent to the finishing
 end to be finished.Next it is sent in 
 bails for it to go to the customer.
