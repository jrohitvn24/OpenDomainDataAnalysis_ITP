		<content>  This is now the most important       
 developing industry &amp; employer. Co.   
 Fermanagh is a beautiful &amp; unspoiled  
 area of countryside, dominated by     
 mountains &amp; lakes. 1/3 of our area is 
 under water &amp; this provides us with a 
 natural resource for fishing (game &amp;  
 coarse fishing) sailing, cruising     
 water skiing etc. During the past 15  
 years a number of new hotels were     
 developed along the shores of Lough   
 Erne e.g. Killyhevlin a 3 star with 25
 bedrooms. It also offers 14 self      
 catering lakeside chalets, which are  
 most popular with families. There are 
 2 smaller family run hotels which can 
 offer good food and accommodation at  
 competitive prices, these are the     
 Railway, and Fort Lodge Hotels.       
  Due to the expanding tourist industry
 courses in catering &amp; management are  
 now organised by the F.E. college.    </content>
