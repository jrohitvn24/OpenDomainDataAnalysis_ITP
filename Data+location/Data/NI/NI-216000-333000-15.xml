		<content>{The Grand Gates}are at the entrance   
 to{Florencecourt House}and{Forest     
{Park.}No one lives in the Gate Lodges 
 now.                                  
{ The Lodges}were cosy and warm.There  
 were three rooms,the kitchen was the  
 biggest room.There was also a living  
 room and a small bedroom.Outside there
 was a big back yard.                  
  My granny was born in one of the     
 lodges and she lived there for        
 eighteen years until{1942.}           
  Altogether{five people}lived in the  
 lodge.Granny went to the Old Gate     
 School and left school at sixteen to  
 work in{Florencecourt House}as a      
{parlour maid.}She worked for Lord and 
 Lady Enniskillen for two years until  
 the family moved to the Mill House.   
  The{Forestry Service}now use the     
 Lodges for storing equipment.The out  
 side is kept in its original glory.   </content>
