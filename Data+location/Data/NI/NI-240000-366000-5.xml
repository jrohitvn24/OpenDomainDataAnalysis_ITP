		<title>05LOUGH MUCK</title>
		<content>{Lough Muck}is a freshwater lake       
 approx.1/2 mile long by 1/8 mile      
 wide,within easy travelling distance  
 of{Omagh.}Until 3O years ago there was
 a pier with changing facilities for   
 organised swimming.Within more recent 
 times the lough was a base for water  
 sports and in particular water skiing.
 fishing of course was also popular    
 with pike,roach and perch being in    
 good supply.                          
             There is no reason        
 why,with proper planning,the lough    
 could not be made into a recreational 
 and tourist centre.It still can       
 provide ample scope for the above     
 pastimes and with the addition of     
 amenities such as picnic areas,etc.It 
 could play an important part of the   
 area's continuing growth.
