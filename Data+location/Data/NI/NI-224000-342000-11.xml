		<content>   I was born over 70 years ago in     
 Belmore St., Enniskillen but later    
 moved to the Pound Brae, then called  
 Prospect Hill. At that time there were
 only two houses on the Pound Brae and 
 the rest was meadow. We lived in the  
 house on the right of the Railway     
 bridge under which ran the Omagh /    
 Londonderry line.                     
   When coming down the Pound Brae the 
 signal box of the Great Northern      
 Railway was as the left and Orchard   
 Terrace was on the right. Along the   
 gas lit street was the Railway Hotel  
 and the Railway Depot and most of the 
 houses offered dinners and teas on the
 Fair Days each month. Unlike today the
 many of houses had front gardens and  
 then were few shops though a Mr Mc    
 Craddick had a jaunting car for hire.
