		<title>16A Day In The Life Of Conor.</title>
		<content>{the teacher}who is on duty rings the  
 bell.Every boy will come running to   
 their line. Each class line will go   
 into school one after another as its  
 name is called out.School ends at     
{15.00}At that time we all say our     
 evening prayers &amp; then go out in an   
 orderly fashion.Before I watch t.v.   
 I sit down &amp; do my homework.After that
 I would go out on my bike with my     
 friend{Martin}until{my parents}come   
 home from work.I would help them in   
 with whatever they had brought home   
 like shopping from{Wellworth's        
{Superstore.}When I'd have finished    
 that  I would go perhaps back to      
 Martin's.Soon{Mammy}would have the tea
 ready for us all.It's nearly always   
 meat &amp; potatoes.Usually after that I  
 go for a quick bath. When I am warm in
 bed at{20.30,}I think over the past   
 day,{say prayers}&amp; soon I fall asleep.</content>
