		<title>12BALLYCASTLE RAILWAY,DERVOCK.</title>
		<content> A railway once passed through{Dervock;
 going from{Ballymoney}to{Ballycastle; 
 via{Dervock, Stranocum, Gracehill}and 
{Capecastle.}The train was sometimes   
 used for carrying sheep and cows but  
 mainly carried passengers. On 2nd     
 July, 1950 it was closed down, because
 people were not travelling on it so   
 much, and there was no money to repair
 the track or rolling stock, nor to pay
 the employees. It was a sad occasion, 
 which the drivers tried to brighten by
 putting paper chains round the boilers
 and funnels of the last train _ pulled
 by 2 engines. The old{STATION}has     
 been converted to a modern bungalow.  
 Some clues to the railway still       
 remain like the{5 mile sign}which     
 stands on Peden's Farm and the{STATION
{GATE}which is at Chestnutt's Garage.  
 Some track is left under a bridge     
 which the train passed through.       </content>
