		<title>09A pupils day in Enniskillen.</title>
		<content>   Another school day. It was 8 o'clock
 and time to get ready. I got up washed
 &amp; dressed.After a quick breakfast, I  
 walked to the bus stop. When we       
 arrived at school, classes had already
 started. First we had English followed
 by General Science. At 11 o'clock the 
 bell rang for a well deserved break. I
 sat down &amp; enjoyed a packet of crisps.
   After fetching books from the wooden
 lockers I dashed off to class.At      
 dinner time I took a packed lunch in  
 the assembly hall, then went outside. 
 The afternoon was most enjoyable when 
 2 periods were P.E. here we played    
 netball &amp; hockey. We then changed     
 back into school uniform &amp; went home  
 by school bus. When I got home I did  
 my homework, had tea watched          
 television &amp; went to bed.
