		<title>10Shooting</title>
		<content>  {Shooting}is a popular sport in our  
 area.  There are many places where    
 people shoot.                         
   One bird that is shot is the{Snipe  
 which lives and nests in swampy areas.
{It makes a characteristic whirring    
{noise as it flies and, as it swerves  
{and dives in flight}it is difficult to
 shoot. {Unfortunately the Snipe is    
{becoming rarer as wet areas are       
{drained and silage harvesters destroy 
{nests.                                
   Other hunters shoot{Pheasants, }many
 of which are reared by people in the  
 area and then released.  There is a   
 closed season for such game birds-they
 may not be shot in the breeding       
 season.                               
  {For sportsmen who dislike killing   
{birds there are clay pigeon clubs     
{where the marksman shoots at discs of 
{clay which are catapulted into the air</content>
