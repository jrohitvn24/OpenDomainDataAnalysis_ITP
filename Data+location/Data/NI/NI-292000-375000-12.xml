		<content> Our school is called{ST Peters}.In our
 school there are about 150 pupils.The 
 school was build in 1918; there were  
 two extensions;the first in 1963 and  
 the second in 1984.It is situated     
 about{half a mile from the shore}.In  
 our school there are seven teaching   
 staff;five kitchen staff and one      
 secretary.We have a caretaker who     
 looks after the school and he is good 
 fun.There was an old cloakroom but now
 it is a laboratory.In the laboratory  
 we do all kinds of things for example 
 we do typing,computer programming,    
 eletronics and other experiments.In   
 our classroom we do normal subjects   
 and other ones as well. For example in
 P.E our favourite game is volleyball  
 but some days we do gymnastics.There  
 is another bigger primary school,{ST.
