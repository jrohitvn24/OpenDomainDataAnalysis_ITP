		<content> The children had to bring turf for the
 old stove which was the only heat in  
 the school. Today my dad leaves me to 
 school by car and I have five pairs of
 shoes. Our school is centrally heated 
 and hot meals are provided.           
      There have been great changes    
 when it comes to jobs. In this area   
 today you could get a job as an       
{electrician, engineer, anything to do 
{with building, factory work and even  
{computer work}. In grandfather's day  
 the jobs were very different. He was a
{thatcher}-putting the straw roof on   
 people's mud-walled homes. Almost     
 every home in this area was thatched  
 fifty years ago so he was kept very   
 busy, cutting long{scallops}-sticks   
 from the ash tree. After he attached  
 them to the roof he wove specially    
 chosen straw in and out through them.
