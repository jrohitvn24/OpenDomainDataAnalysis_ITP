		<title>14Shankbridge Post Office</title>
		<content> Nobody knows when the post office came
 to Shankbridge but there has been one 
 there for over 100 years.The roof used
 to be thatched and much lower than it 
 is now.The O'Neill family have been   
 running the post office for over three
 generations.People used to come to the
 post office in their pony and traps.  
 Some people used to come to the post  
 office from Kells Water.The post      
 office had its final customer in April
 1985 when it was finaly closed.The    
 post office and adjoining buildings   
 will be demolished this year when a   
 new bungalow will be built on the     
 site.
