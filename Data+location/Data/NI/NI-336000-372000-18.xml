		<content> When you are ill you usually have to  
 go to the health centre and           
 wait,sometimes for a long time,for    
 your name to be called out.I have had 
 many illnesses and bugs. Once I fell  
 when I was on my holidays at Portrush 
 because I was trying to jump over a   
 chain but I missed it and fell on my  
 tooth.I was taken to a hospital in    
 Portstewart where the doctor was very 
 nice and told me to take a glass of   
 salty water two or three times a      
 day.It was horrible but I got used to 
 it.The next day my face was all       
 swollen up and I looked like my teddy 
 which is a monkey.It was terrible.At  
 the end of the week we went home and I
 had to go to the Royal Victoria       
 Hospital where they gave me gas to put
 me to sleep and pulled my tooth back  
 into place.I had to wear a plate for  
 weeks.                                </content>
