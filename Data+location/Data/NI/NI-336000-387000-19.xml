		<content> In Primary One I thought the classroom
 was a house with no walls to separate 
 the rooms and that the blackboard was 
 a giant piece of black paper.We learnt
 the alphabet and numbers.To help with 
 our sums we had small plastic bricks. 
  In Primary Two we went on to tens and
 unit sums, learnt bigger words in our 
 reading, wrote stories and still had  
 playtime.                             
  In Primary Three we were taught      
 hundreds, tens and units,school work  
 got harder and we got written         
 homeworks with spellings.             
  In Primary One to Three school       
 started at nine o'clock and stoped    
 at two o'clock but in Primary Four we 
 went on to three o'clock.             
  In Primary Four we did multiplying   
 and dividing, the boys/girls got two  
 hours of Handwork or Needlework a     
 week.                                 </content>
