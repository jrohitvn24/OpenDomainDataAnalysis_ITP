		<title>09Agricultural Show</title>
		<content> Carrowdore Agricultural Show started  
 in 1958 but as a show takes a while to
 organise its first show was not held  
 until 21 - 23 June,1959. This show was
 just a gymkhana but since then new    
 events have been added.  This year for
 the first time there is to be an Inter
 Primary Schools Its a Knock Out       
 competition.  Horses, pigs, sheep,    
 goats,cows, bullocks and bulls are all
 judged at the show.  The show grounds 
 are kindly lent by Mr Jennings.       
 The show also has an Old Time Drive   
 and a Country Market.  Lately there   
 has not been so many people coming to 
 the Show because of the Young Farmers 
 Rally and a local Air Show, in        
 Newtownards.
