		<content> The local football team was formed in 
 the early 1900's.But they soon broke  
 up as a result of the wars.The team   
 was reformed in the early 60's by a   
 group of locals who were supporters of
 Everton.That is how the team got their
 name {MILFORD EVERTON.}               
  Milford Everton are founder members  
 of the IRISH LEAGUE.They have two     
 teams,1 is in the Irish League 2nd    
 division and the other is in the MID  
 ULSTER LEAGUE.                        
  The team has two pitches in          
 Milford.The pitches are called Holm   
 Park Milford.                         
  The highlight of their performances  
 to date was the defeat of Portadown   
 in 1983 in the Irish Senior Cup.      
  The 2nd team was promoted from the   
 3rd division and they just missed
