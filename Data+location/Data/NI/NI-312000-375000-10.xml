		<title>10PHILIP THE MAGICIAN</title>
		<content> My daddy is a Magician and he does    
 magic shows for different people.We   
 have about five doves and my daddy    
 makes them appear out of empty bags.  
 Sometimes he borrows rabbits and makes
 them appear out of empty boxes.He has 
 a yellow magic box to keep his        
 equipment in. It has a wand,a rabbit  
 coming out of a hat,and name Philip   
 painted on it.                        
   Once daddy came and did magic at our
 Christmas concert.He was doing a trick
 with a goose.The trick went wrong and 
 the goose,glad to be released from its
 box,escaped and flew to the back of   
 the hall flapping its wings wildly.   
 Lots of women screamed and ran to the 
 sides of the hall.Daddy used to be a  
 clown in a circus,called the Courtney 
 Brothers circus.He likes being a      
 magician and so do we.
