		<title>17THE GIANT'S CAUSEWAY</title>
		<content>    One of the most famous{natural     
{wonders}of Ireland is the Giant's     
 Causeway.                             
    It was formed by volcanic activity 
 that took place about sixty million   
 years ago.{Hexagonal columns of basalt
 were formed as a result of slow       
 cooling and contractionof the lava    
 flow.                                 
    Legend has it that an Irish giant, 
{Finn MacCoul, built the Causeway}so   
 that he might stride across the sea to
 Scotland without getting his feet wet.
    To the west of Causeway Head is    
 Portcoon Cave,where the sea has found 
 a weakness in the rock.Care needs to  
 be taken when exploring the cave and a
 boat is required.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
