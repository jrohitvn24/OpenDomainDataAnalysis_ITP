		<title>14THE BATTLE</title>
		<content>  It was a summers day when mothers and
 wives kissed their men goodbye.Henry  
 ,Willie,Jemmy and the other leaders   
 scrambled to the top of the old mound 
 and raised a banner.                  
  When John McKinney arrived from      
 Carnmoney with the news that the      
 military had been defeated at Larne,  
 this spurred the boys.The men in total
 were only 500 strong, with  a few     
 wearing uniforms.They all had one     
 thing in common, they were going to do
 or die for their country.Many famous  
 historians have spent their lifetime  
 studying the events of the battle at  
 Antrim.They can give specific details 
 of injuries sustained and even where  
 the dying fell.                       
  The rebels were unsuccessful as the  
 government troops were better equipped
 and better led.They were routed and   
 fled to the hills.                    </content>
