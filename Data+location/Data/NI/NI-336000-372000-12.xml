		<title>12Shandon Motte</title>
		<content> In the late 12th and early 13th       
 centuries Shandon Motte was           
 constructed by the Normans.           
  The name Shandon comes from the      
 Gaelic "Sean Dun" meaning "the old    
 fort". Thus the nearby road was called
 Shandon Park.                         
  The Motte is still there today. Lots 
 of trees and bushes have grown on top 
 of it. There is a panoramic view which
 must have been useful to the Normans  
 when they needed to see the enemy     
  Round the motte there used to be a   
 ditch which has since been filled     
 in.On top of the motte there would    
 have been a wooden fort surrounded by 
 a wooden fence.                       
  There are many of these mottes in    
 Ireland and they were built in a line 
 along the North coast.
