		<content> is served. Wakes can become very      
 entertaining affairs.Stories will be  
 told all night and some elderly men   
 are regular wake goers and a renowned 
 for their storytelling. The element of
 celebration in a wake can be          
 understood by remembering that it is  
 believed that the deceased has gone to
 a better life. On the second day the  
 coffin is brought to the church with  
 friends and relatives following       
 behind. In Coalisland the body is left
 overnight in the church. This is not  
 the custom in all parishes. The       
 funeral mass is celebrated on the     
 third day after which the coffin is   
 carried to the cemetery for burial. In
{Coalisland}the cemetery is beside the 
 old church so the coffin is carried in
 the hearse. A short service is held at
 the graveside. It is customary to     
 provide a meal for the chief mourners.</content>
