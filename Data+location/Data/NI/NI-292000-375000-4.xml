		<content> As a result of its siting in the      
 middle  of the parish a{division }has 
 grown up over years  between the uppe 
 and  lower inhabitants of the  area.  
 Hopefully however with the erection of
 more homes on the site of the base    
 such divisions will eventually        
 disappear.                            
         During the last few years     
 efforts have been  made to  promote an
{industrial estate} on the site at     
 present there are several factories   
 based here.These include a{furniture }
 manufacturer,a {building supplier,}a  
 bed manufacturer and two cement       
 works.Farming in also carried on in   
 parts of aerodrome which lies between 
 the runways with{crops}being grown and
{cattle}grazed{Boat-building}has always
 been a traditional industry here      
 although now new materials are in use.
