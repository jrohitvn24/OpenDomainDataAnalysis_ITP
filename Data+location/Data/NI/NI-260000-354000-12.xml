		<title>12SCHOOL ROUTINE</title>
		<content> Most people travel by bus to school,  
 but some walk and some come by car.   
 The day starts at half nine with      
 assembly and lessons start at nine-   
 forty and each one lasts thirty five  
 minutes. There is a break after the   
 third lesson at eleven-twenty five,   
 which lasts ten minutes.              
    There are another two lessons      
 before lunch break at twelve-thirty   
 five. There are another four lessons  
 in the afternoon, and the day ends at 
 five to four when the buses come to   
 collect the pupils.                   
    School in general is not considered
 too bad by the pupils, but discipline 
 is fairly strict.                     
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
