		<title>14An historic house.</title>
		<content>   All over the 18th century, Ireland's
 wealthy landlords built beautiful     
 houses, many with designs based on    
 classic Greek architecture. The first 
 Earl of Belmore planned a mansion at  
 Castlecoole that would cost Â£30,000   
 but it eventually cost Â£54,000.       
   It was begun in 1788 and the        
 beautiful English Portland stone was  
 brought by sea to Ballyshannon,       
 Carried 8 miles by bullock cart to    
 Lough Erne, by boat to Enniskillen,   
 and by cart the 2 miles to the site.  
 At one time there were 78 craftsmen   
 and 83 labourers working on the house.
 Plasters were brought from England to 
 complete the decoration and by 1797   
 the most luxurious house in the area  
 was ready to move into. However due to
 its expensive unkeep the building is  
 now National Trust property. It is    
 visited by hundreds each year.        </content>
