		<title>08Employment in Ballywalter</title>
		<content>    There is a lot of unemployment in  
 Northern Ireland because there is not 
 a lot of work. Some people from       
 Ballywalter work at Shorts Aircraft   
 Factory, some work at Harland and     
 Wolff shipyard and some work at       
 Donaghadee Carpet Factory. My brother 
 is a lucky one because he is a painter
 and decorator for my friend's dad.    
    Lord Dunleath used to employ many  
 people from the village but now he    
 does not need so many.                
    Some people who have not jobs do   
 not waste their lives by standing at  
 the corner. They go and wash people's 
 windows. Fishermen who own the big    
 fishing boats employ some people to   
 help them. Some folk own little rowing
 boats and go out to the Long Rock to  
 collect dulse and sell it to the      
 visitors.                             
    Farmers do not employ many people. </content>
