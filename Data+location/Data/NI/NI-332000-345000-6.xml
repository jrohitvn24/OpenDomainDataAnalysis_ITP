		<title>06Forestry in Guiness:Felling</title>
		<content> The trees are sold tarrited as        
 standing.This means that every        
 hundredth tree is felled and          
 measured.These are then put on        
 offer,measured,and the section of     
 forest is set out to tender.The       
 highest tender gets to buy the trees. 
  They are then felled and hoisted on  
 to the lorry.The trees are then taken 
 to a sawmill,where they are made into 
 fencing posts,strainers for fencing,  
 fork lift pallets,and occasionally,   
 garden furniture.The worst timber goes
 to make spandboard.Other types go to  
 make housing rafters and fencing      
 overlap.                              
 The forest is at present being        
 harvested and replanted.It will de    
 about fifty years before it can be    
 harvested again.
