 Area bounded on west by Antrim        
 BAY and situated at N.E.corner of     
 Lough Neagh.Area of fairly level      
 ground dissected by Sixmilewater River
 which runs through town centre. The   
 latter occupies top third of our      
 area with remainder mainly rural      
 land.                                 
   The town centre which served the    
 original population of about 3000     
 people has now a large number of      
 empty shops. The main shopping focus  
 has now shifted to the new            
 hypermarket called the Castle Centre  
 which gets its name from the ruins    
 of the castle nearby with its         
 picturesque grounds.The centre        
 attracts shoppers from well outside   
 the town as well as the local         
 population of over 25000.             </content>
