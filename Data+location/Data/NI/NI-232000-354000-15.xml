		<content>We recorded the weather for a          
fortnight in May.                      
Temperatures were 29 degrees Centigrade
maximum and 5 degrees Centigrade       
minimum. The range was 24 degrees      
Centigrade and the average was 17      
degrees Centigrade.                    
We also measured the humidity which    
was 50%. This is to be expected as     
this is a damp area near the lakes and 
mountains receiving a lot of rain.     
124ml of rain fell in this fortnight.  
This is beneficial to farmers.         
The wind was mostly North-Easterly and 
not very strong.                       
There was a lot of sunshine during one 
of these weeks.                        
Generally the weather is mild in the   
summertime and cold and damp in the    
wintertime.                            
                                       
                                       </content>
