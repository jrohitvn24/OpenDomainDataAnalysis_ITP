 reflected in the Gaelic football,     
 hurling and camogie clubs.There is a  
 Gaelic equivalent of the Girl Guides  
 called the Brigini .There are Gaelic  
 culture clubs where Irish dancing,    
 music and language are promoted. The  
 local Youth club has a junior and     
 senior section and also a special     
 section for handicapped people.The    
 R.A.Y.group&lt;Renewal And Youth>is      
 organised by young people for young   
 people and promotes activities to     
 counteract the attractions of alcohol 
 and drugs. The C.L.M.&lt;Cuarteoiri Le
