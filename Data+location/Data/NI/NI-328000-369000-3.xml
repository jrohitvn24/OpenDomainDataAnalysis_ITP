		<title>03   THE BOG MEADOWS (2)</title>
		<content>   For many years people campaigned for
 and against the draining of the Bog   
 Meadows but it was not until the      
 1960's when good building land was    
 almost impossible to find inside      
 Belfast City Boundary that the major  
 decision was taken. The river         
 Blackstaff was straightened and the   
 meadows were drained and dried out.   
 Now one of the most modern industrial 
 estates, close to the railway, the    
 link roads and the motorways covers   
 most of the famous meadows. The large 
 fruit and vegetable markets and many  
 commercial firms have moved from the  
 city centre to the new estates. New   
 industries have been encouraged to    
 site their new premises there,        
 hopefully to provide employment       
 especially for those people who have  
 been made redundant because of the    
 decline of the traditional industries.</content>
