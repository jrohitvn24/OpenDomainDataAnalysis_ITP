 Class B or worse with the exception   
 of the M1 motorway which passes       
 through the north west corner. The    
 Hillhall Road which is the main road  
 in the area has many bends despite the
 fact that it carries a heavy volume of
 traffic between Lisburn and Belfast   
 especially at peak periods.           
 Some of the side roads e.g. Carson's  
 Lane and Pine Hill are only wide      
 enough for one car.                   
{                                      
{Public Transport}                     
 Ulsterbus operate a service on the    
 Hillhall Road seven times per day, six
 days per week but other roads are not 
 serviced.  There is no train service  
 at all in this area with the nearest  
 station being near Hilden (on the     
 Lisburn side of the village)
