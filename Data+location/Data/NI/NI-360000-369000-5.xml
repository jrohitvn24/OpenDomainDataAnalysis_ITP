		<title>05Industry in Ballywalter</title>
		<content>    In days gone by there was quite a  
 lot of local industry in Ballywalter. 
 A tailor made clothes and shoe-maker  
 made their shoes. The blacksmith not  
 only made horse shoes but he also made
 farm equipment.                       
    Now there is very little industry  
 in Ballywalter. There are still two   
 factories and a few men running their 
 own small businesses.                 
    Weatherdair came here from Bradford
 in l949 to make raincoats. In l963    
 they built a new textile factory and  
 now it is owned by Van Heusen and it  
 makes suits.                          
    There is a new factory on the      
 foundation of an old flax mill. They  
 employ only nine men and make         
 engineering parts for Shorts, the     
 Belfast aeroplane makers. There are   
 also one or two men doing welding     
 jobs.                                 </content>
