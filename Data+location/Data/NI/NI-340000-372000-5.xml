		<title>05Sunday in Dundonald</title>
		<content> At eleven o'clock the bells of St.    
 Elizabeth's ring for church.The many  
 churches are fairly well attended,    
 especially in the mornings.Most people
 probably enjoy Sunday as a day to     
 relax but some find it boring.A park, 
 playing fields,and a golf course are  
 open for the more energetic.There is  
 less traffic with few lorries and vans
 although at the village green during  
 church times there can be quite a     
 traffic jam.In summer the Newtownards 
 Road is fairly busy with through      
 traffic to the coast.There are more   
 learner drivers than usual because the
 minor roads are not as busy.Most shops
 are closed except certain newsagents  
 and the Mini-Market.A few garages are 
 open for petrol.Many do gardening,    
 clean the car or other odd jobs.Others
 visit their friends. T.V viewing is   
 popular on Sunday nights.             </content>
