		<title>13HOUSING IN SCARVA</title>
		<content> Modern houses in Scarva are very      
 different from those built at the     
 beginning of this Century. In 1900 the
 houses were in a poor condition, they 
 were two storey terraced houses. They 
 were built with stone and mud and the 
 roofs were thatched. Today they are   
 built with brick and cement with tiled
 roofs.                                
    In 1978 an attractive Park was     
 opened beside our largest modern      
 housing estate, Moody Park. The other 
 housing estate,Glenloughan Park is    
 much smaller. There are also a number 
 of bungalows around the Village. The  
 terraced houses,in Main Street        
 although in good condition are much   
 older.
