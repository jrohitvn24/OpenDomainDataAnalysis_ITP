		<content> When the school was opened in 1966 it 
 had 16 teachers which was small       
 compared with the present teaching    
 staff of 39.                          
    The uniform comprises of, for girls
 a kingfisher skirt, a turquoise       
 shirt-style blouse, school long       
 sleeved v-neck jumper with embossed   
 crest. The boys uniform comprises of  
 light charcoal grey trousers, pearl   
 grey shirt and grey long sleeved      
 v-neck jumper with embossed crest.    
    Life at St. Ciarans is not all     
 study and homework. Our boys and girls
 compete in many competitions,         
 especially football, basketball, and  
 netball for the girls. The highlight  
 of the schools sporting year is the   
 annual sports year with many trophies 
 and prizes for the winners.
