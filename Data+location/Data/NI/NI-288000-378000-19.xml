 left will only enable a brief account 
 to be given.                          
  {The farm has 133 acres}of which 100 
 are suitable for cultivation, 20 for  
 grazing and 13 comprise buildings etc.
  {Sheep and beef cattle}are reared.   
 About 50 year old heifers wt. 300     
 kilos bought Oct. and Nov. are housed 
 and fed silage during winter.They are 
 put to grass in spring and sold when  
 weighing 450 to 500 kilos.            
   About 270 to 290 lambs are born from
 mid March. At fourteen days lambs are 
 injected against disease. Fleeces of  
 ewes clipped end of May make up to Â£4.</content>
