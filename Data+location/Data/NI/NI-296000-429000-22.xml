Some new housing developments have been built in the village recently.  Detached properties with land around them were  bought by developers in the mid 2000s when the property market was booming.  In 2008 the country suffered a recession so the developers could not afford to build as planned and these dwellings remain derelict.    There have been many changes in the Castlecatt Road area of the village.  A new Rectory has been erected for the Church of Ireland minister and a new estate called Castlewood Park has been built on land belonging to the Church of Ireland beside the Rectory.   &lt;br />
