  Donaghadee used to be a fishing      
 village with lots of fishermen.       
 Although D'Dee is not a "planned"     
 growth area its population is rising  
 slowly and the town is becoming more  
 and more a dormitory town for Belfast.
                                       
 Residents in the town and surrounding 
 area turn more and to the larger      
 centres such as Bangor and Newtownards
 for shopping and employment.          
                                       
 Most of the land in and near the town 
 used to be owned by the Delacherois   
 family. Some still is, but much has   
 now been bought by the resident farmer
 and/or occupier.
