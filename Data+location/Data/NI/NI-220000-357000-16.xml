		<title>16Fire Station:ANDREW&amp;GARY S</title>
		<content> In the fire station there are two fire
 engines.The big fire engine holds six 
 men and the small fire engine is held 
 on standby.There are sixteen hoses on 
 the big engine and some of these hoses
 are seventy five feet long. The fire  
 station has been operating for ten    
 years and it took twelve months to    
 build.The most common fire in winter  
 is a chimney fire and in summer a bog 
 or forest fire is the commonest.The   
 practice is on Wednesday.They take the
 water from a river or a hydrant in the
 road.On the engine they bring oxygen  
 and breathing apparatus,ladders,axes  
 and metal saws. When firemen are sent 
 for,a bleeper goes off and they hurry 
 to the station and put on their gear. 
 The leggings are strapped to the boots
 which they pull on in seconds with the
 yellow plastic coat and helmet.The    
 first six men go out to the call.     </content>
