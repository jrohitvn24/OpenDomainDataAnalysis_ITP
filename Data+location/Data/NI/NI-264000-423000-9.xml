		<title>09LIMAVADY POPULATION MOBILITY</title>
		<content> The main reason for population        
 movement for all sections of the      
 Limavady community is{work.           
 "My father's job in the Civil Service 
 made a move from Newcastle to Limavady
 necessary."                           
 Another major reason is{marriage. }In 
 most cases the woman moves to her new 
 husband's area.  Many families just   
 want a change to a more pleasant area.
 "We were fed up with the noise of the 
 town and wanted to live in the fresh  
 country air."                         
{Retirement}brings many moves in this  
 direction.  Several families moved    
 because their old house was condemned 
 and was being demolished.  As families
 grow there is a desire for a bigger   
 house of their own.  Limavady is a    
 prosperous, growing town and has a    
 high degree of population movement.
