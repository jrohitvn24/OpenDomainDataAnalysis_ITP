		<content> ARDBARRON, A TOWN-LAND, ABOUT THREE   
 MILES FROM KILLEN.                    
 THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF BUNGALOWS    
 BUILT LATELY AND OLD HOUSES HAVE BEEN 
 RENOVATED.  MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN     
 ARDBARRON ARE FARMERS WHO KEEP COWS,  
 SHEEP AND PIGS.                       
 ARDBARRON IS VERY NEAR TO THE BOG     
 WHERE THE PEOPLE CUT THEIR TURF.  THE 
 MOUNTAIN ACROSS FROM ARDBARRON IS     
 CALLED "THE BIN ROCK".  IF YOU CLIMB  
 TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN THERE IS A 
 LOVELY VIEW AROUND THE WHOLE          
 COUNTRY-SIDE. LOUGH LEE IS UP IN THIS 
 MOUNTAIN AND A LOT OF PEOPLE GO THERE 
 FOR TROUT FISHING.                    
 ARDBARRON HAS AN ORANGE HALL WHERE    
 THEY HOLD DANCES AND BAZAARS, IT ALSO 
 HAS ITS OWN PIPE BAND.                
 IF YOU ARE EVER IN ARDBARRON YOU WILL 
 HEAR THE CUCKOO CALLING WHILE SHE IS  
 HERE.                                 </content>
