		<content> Another resident was asked what her   
 earliest memories of Kells were.She   
 told me that the only thing she could 
 remember was that on a certain day    
 every week a horse drawn bread cart   
 came to Kells.Then I asked her if she 
 remembered what she was doing from the
 year 1914 until year 1918.She told me 
 that she was working in the Old Green 
 Woolen Mill.The next question was did 
 she remember the National Strike which
 was in 1926.She told me that she      
 couldn't remember much about that but 
 one thing she did remember was that   
 there was no coal and people had to   
 saw trees for the fire.I then asked   
 her what she remembered of the second 
 world war.She told me there were      
 blackouts, there was no transport and 
 food was rationed.Houses had no       
 bathrooms nor toilets and were        
 whitewashed.                          </content>
