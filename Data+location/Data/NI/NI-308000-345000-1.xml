 low, ice-moulded, egg-shaped hills    
 which were formed from morainic       
 materials as{Post-glacial}ice-sheets  
 retreated.  Drumlins range in height  
 from 60m to 100m and have a good basic
{soil}structure.  The soils are of a   
 medium loam that respond easily to    
 cultivation.  Under good agriculture  
 practices they are productive, but    
 loam (or brown earths) tend to leach  
 rapidly so additions of artificial or 
 farmyard manures are essential to     
 maintain fertility.  Fields tend to   
 circle the drumlins in a wheel        
 pattern.
