		<title>10The Connswater River cont'd</title>
		<content> of kingfishers flitting up and down   
 the stream. Up to the present time the
 river has been smelly and dirty       
 because things were getting dumped    
 into it.People got so fed up with the 
 dirt and smell that they decided to   
 set up an action committee, the       
 Connswater River Conservation         
 Committee C.R.C.C. for short. They    
 asked people to volunteer their help  
 to clean the river as well as asking  
 the government for help. So far this  
 year 12 cars, 24 shopping trolleys and
 two lorryloads full of dirt and       
 rubbish have been removed. Young      
 people have been helped by the Dept of
 Agriculture to dredge away the smelly 
 mud and clean the overgrown banks on  
 either side. The committee hopes to   
 transform the Connswater from a smelly
 eyesore into an amenity for the people
 of East Belfast.                      </content>
