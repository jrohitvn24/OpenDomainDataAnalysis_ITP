		<title>03EDUCATION IN NEWTOWNARDS</title>
		<content> Our school, Castle Gardens, is one of 
 7 primary schools in Newtownards. It  
 was originally a National school,     
 built in l882, when many children from
 the nearby Walkers Mill attended as   
 "part timers". Today there are 59l    
 pupils and 2l teachers including our  
 headmaster Mr McGibney and one        
 full-time remedial teacher. Most      
 children in all primary schools take  
 part in the Selection Procedure in    
 their P7 year. Two Verbal Reasoning   
 tests decide which type of secondary  
 schools each child is to go to. Three 
 grades are awarded A, M and G. Only   
 children with an A can be sure of a   
 grammar school place. Our after school
 activities include football,          
 badminton, netball, choir and music.  
 The PTA has raised funds to buy a     
 computer, climbing frame, cassette    
 recorders, T.V.s, Videos and a Piano. </content>
