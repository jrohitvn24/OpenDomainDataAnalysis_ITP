		<content> There is a staff of over              
 600 to help the patients- 350 nurses, 
 22 doctors, 230 ancillary.            
 The most common disease for           
 in-patients is heart disease.         
    Sister Ignatius is the Director of 
 Nursing Services and has been at the  
 hospital since 1951.  Apart from      
 allocating nursing staff to various   
 departments, providing professional   
 advice, and ensuring that the needs   
 of student nurses in training are met,
 a very important part of her work     
 involves the nursing budget.  She     
 regrets that her administrative duties
 have lessened the time she can spend  
 with nurses and patients, and will    
 find such time even more constrained  
 as the new tower block rises beside   
 the older building of 1900.
