 For{RECREATION}I would listen to my   
 RADIO. I listen to five different disk
 jockeys who I think are the best.     
 Radio is a good way to hear music and 
 commentries on football matches. My   
 favourite radio station is Radio 1.   
 Radio1 gives you the update in the    
 charts and plays some older pop songs 
 from the 60's.                        
  The comic I get every week is{"ROY OF
{THE ROVERS".}Roy Race plays for first 
 division football team Melchester     
 Rovers. He has been going for 37yrs.  
 but is only 29yrs. old. He leads a    
 very exciting life. The other stories 
 are funny and serious. To amuse myself
 I would play with a balloon indoors.  
 There is also a field behind my house 
 with a river and a waterfall. The     
 farmer's house is at the end of this  
 field.                                </content>
