		<title>15LAMBEG/CASTLEROBIN OPINIONS1</title>
		<content> During our survey of this area,we     
 interviewed several local people to   
 determine local attitudes and         
 opinions.We interviewed three         
 categories of people;{School-children,
{Shop-keepers}and{Senior citizens.}    
 On the next few pages are some of     
 their thoughts and opinions about life
 in the{LAMBEG/CASTLEROBIN}area in     
 1985.                                 
 The questions asked were designed to  
 show a little of what it was like to; 
 1){live}in the area,                  
 2){work}in the area,                  
 3){shop}in the area,                  
 4) find{recreation}in the area.       
 The sample in all categories was very 
 small,but we tried to find out as many
 generally held views as possible.     
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
