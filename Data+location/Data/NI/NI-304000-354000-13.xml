 Is the night of October the 31st.     
 It is the night when children dress   
 up in fancy clothes or ragged clothes.
 They also wear masks, some made of    
 plastic. Some of the masks are scarey 
 and some of them are funny. Instead of
 wearing masks some children put make

 the olden days people saw witchs in   
 the sky on their brooms flying about.
