 the farm at home.All{crops}except corn
 were planted by spade.Corn was sown by
 hand from the sheet tied round the    
 farmers neck and harrowed with one    
 horse and a harrow.The corn was cut   
 with a scythe and thrashed with aflail
  He had very little spare time and    
 was not allowedto{dances}until the age
 of eighteen.Everyone walked to dances 
 and wore hobnail{boots}and corduroy   
 trousers.The music was supplied by a  
 small accordian or a mouth organ,     
 played by one person.A barn dance     
 would last to two or three o,clock in 
 the morning.The floors including dance
 floors were made of hardened dry      
 clay.The prices then were very cheap  
 compared to today's.A two year old cow
 was Â£6.Today about Â£500.A stamp was a 
 half penny,today seventeen pence.     </content>
