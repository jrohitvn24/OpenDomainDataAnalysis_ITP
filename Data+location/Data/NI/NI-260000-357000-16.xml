		<title>16THE PLAYING FIELDS</title>
		<content> NEW PLAYING FIELDS  WERE MADE IN      
 BALLYGAWLEY IN 1982_3. THEY ARE       
 BEHIND ST CIARAN'S HALL. THERE IS A   
 GAELIC FOOTBALL PITCH AND A SOCCER    
 PITCH . THERE IS A PLAYING PARK. IN IT
 THERE ARE FOUR SWINGS AND TWO SEE -   
 SAWS. THERE IS A CLIMBING FRAME. THE  
 LITTLE ONES ENJOY GOING TO THE PLAYING
 PARK. THERE IS A NEW GATE AND NO CARS 
 ARE ALLOWED IN. SOMETIMES THE BIG GATE
 IS OPENED TO LET CARS IN. THERE ARE   
 TWO BABY SWINGS AND TWO BIG           
 SWINGS.LAST YEAR IN THE PLAYING FIELDS
 THERE WERE SPORTS.THE PLAYING FIELDS  
 ARE BUILT ALONG THE BANKS OF THE      
 RIVER.THERE IS A PATH AROUND THE      
 PLAYING PARK SO THAT PEOPLE CAN WALK  
 AROUND IT.UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NOT  
 ALL THAT MUCH USE MADE OF THE PLAYING 
 FIELDS EXCEPT IN THE SUMMER TIME.
