		<title>01THE RIVER FOYLE</title>
		<content>{The River Foyle rises in the Sperrins.
{At Londonderry it is very wide. It is 
{between a quarter and a half a mile   
{wide in some places. It has to be     
{dredged at all times for ships because
{it is very muddy. The river used to be
{very dirty but has been cleaned up a  
{bit. People fish in the river for     
{sport and sail and row in it. Salmon  
{are caught by the Foyle Fisheries.    
{These salmon are sent to be auctioned 
{at Billingsgate Market in London.Some-
{times seals come from the sea to catch
{the salmon. A few years ago a killer  
{whale nicknamed Dopey Dick came up the
{river after the salmon and seals.
