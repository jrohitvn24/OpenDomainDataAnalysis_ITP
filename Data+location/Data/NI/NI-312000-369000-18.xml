		<content>    St.Joseph's Gaelic Athletic Club   
 was founded in 1945, the first        
 President being Fr.O'Hare. The club is
 affiliated to thr Gaelic Athletic     
 Association which celebrated it's     
 centenary in 1984. The local club has 
 an excellent staff of officials who   
 vigorously promote Gaelic culture and 
 games, i.e. Irish music and dancing,  
 Irish drama and writing; and Gaelic   
 football, hurling and camogie. Teams  
 in the latter compete in Co. Antrim   
 leagues.                              
    A very successful annual event is  
 the "Scor", a competition for all ages
 in Irish dancing, verse speaking,     
 instrumental music and drama. Ceili   
 dancing in the social sense is well   
 catered for, and Irish Language       
 classes are held. The club has just   
 bought new premises at Bell's Corner  
 and a new pitch etc. is planned.      </content>
