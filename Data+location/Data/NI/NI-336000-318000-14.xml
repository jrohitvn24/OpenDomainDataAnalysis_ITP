		<title>14HOW PEOPLE COMMUNICATE</title>
		<content> In these days of ever increasing      
 communications we discovered that     
 although most people have telephones  
 many people still write some letters. 
 Of all the houses we surveyed  we     
 found that 29% had no telephone 57%   
 had one telephone and the others had  
 two or more.                          
 People also communicate with friends  
 by writing letters.  However they are 
 not as frequent letter writers because
 only 12% would write once a week .    
 The vast majority would perhaps write 
 once a month or even less .           
 It would appear from the study that   
 the people in this area have friends  
  all over the world in places like New
 Zealand , America , Canada ,Europe and
 Austalia as well as other parts of the
 British Isles.                        
                                       
                                       </content>
