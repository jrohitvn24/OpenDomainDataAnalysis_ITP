		<content>                                       
 THE TIN PLATING USED IN THIS INDUSTRY 
 IS MINED IN WALES AND SHIPPED IN THE  
 FORM OF FLAT SHEETS TO THE FACTORY    
 FLOOR WHERE IT IS CUT TO THE REQUIRED 
 SIZE. APPROXIMATELY 28 CANS ARE       
 OBTAINED FROM A SINGLE SHEET.         
 CANS WHICH ARE USED FOR SUCH          
 COMMODITIES AS STRAWBERRIES AND MEAT  
 MUST HAVE THEIR INNER SURFACE         
 LACQUERED TO PREVENT DISCOLOURATION OF
 THE FOOD AND THIS IS DONE ON THE      
 PORTADOWN PREMISES.                   
 THE TIN WHILE BEING SHAPED AT A HIGH  
 TEMPERATURE IS EITHER LEFT PLAIN OR IN
 THE CASE OF THINNER MORE FLEXIBLE     
 PLATE BEADED FOR ADDED STRENGTH.      
 THE CYLINDRICAL SHAPE HAVING BEEN     
 FORMED ONE END IS SEALED ON.          
 THE FINISHED CANS ARE TRANSPORTED BY  
 MEANS OF FORKLIFT TRUCKS TO THE       
 WAREHOUSE WHERE THEY ARE STACKED.     </content>
