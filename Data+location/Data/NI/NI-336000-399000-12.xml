		<title>12AN OLD "RESIDENTER"</title>
		<content> Here is an old man, in his eighties,  
 stiff and bent from a lifetime of     
 work. He has a strange talent. He is a
 "diviner". He makes his rod from{     
{"black sally"}(willow) or ash, cut    
 near the root in the shape of a       
 "cattypult". With this held firmly in 
 both hands and{"both legs on the      
{ground"}he can find water, and even   
 dead bodies. He says{"Water on the    
{surface - there're no kick with it."} 
 He has had this ability since he left 
 school. He has worked for government  
 agencies finding water - yes, and     
 bodies! His doctor has recently       
 advised him to stop this work. Why?{  
{"It would effect you - you would get  
{staggery."}When did he last divine? { 
{"Last Saturday."}- so he has not taken
 his doctor's advice. He continues to  
 search for hidden springs for the     
 farmer needing water.                 </content>
