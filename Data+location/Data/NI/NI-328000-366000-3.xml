		<title>03LIFE IN A PROTESTANT ESTATE</title>
		<content> I live in Areema Drive which is in a  
 Protestant estate. Not far away is    
 Twinbrook, a Catholic estate. Last    
 week we had a lot of trouble with the 
 Catholics. They wanted to fight the   
 older children. Now it is back to     
 normal.                               
 On Fraday Heather got her windows     
 broken and she had to repair them with
 sellotape.                            
 On the road joining the estates there 
 is a ramp to slow the traffic. There  
 is also a river.                      
 On Thursday the police came down to   
 block the roads because the people    
 from Areema were having a meeting     
 about closing the roadbetween the     
 estates. Every night the police come  
 up to the cricket pitch to see if     
 there are any Catholics around.       
                                       
                                       </content>
