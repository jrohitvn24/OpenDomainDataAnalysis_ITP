		<content>      We know little about our area but
 we do know that the Normans came in   
 the twelfth century.  A mote and      
 wooden keep were built by the Normans 
 just a few miles outside Ballywalter. 
 The mote is now surrounded by trees.  
      We think the Normans built a     
 Medieval Church near Whitechurch. In  
 Whitechurch Graveyard are two Norman  
 coffin lids which have markings.      
 There is a sword for a man on one and 
 a pair of scissors for a woman on the 
 other.                                
     People came from Scotland and     
 England at the beginning of the l7th  
 century. The roofs of the houses were 
 covered with slates which came from   
 Tullycavey Quarries, about a mile     
 away.                                 
     In l85l the harbour was built and 
 the coal boats began to come. Potatoes
 and grain were shipped to other places</content>
