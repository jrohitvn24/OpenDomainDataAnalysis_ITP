		<content> My family go to the dentist on the    
 Belmont Road and he is very good.My   
 mum used to work for him before I was 
 born.I have only one filling which is 
 good if you are eleven years old. We  
 go to him every six months for a check
 up as well, and when I have any loose 
 teeth I also go to him as I dont like 
 my mum or dad trying to pull them     
 out.When you go in to his surgery you 
 have to sit in a special chair which  
 leans back so that he can see your    
 teeth properly.He looks at them and   
 says things about them to the nurse   
 who writes them down.He has a drill   
 which makes a high pitched noise and  
 sprays out water.Sometimes if you are 
 getting a filling he will give you an 
 injection so that it doesnt hurt.I    
 dont mind going to the dentist as my  
 teeth are good.
