		<content> Spending{free or leisure time}is of   
 increasing importance today because   
 people have more time away from work, 
 whether working on shifts or sadly    
 unemployed.                           
 In our school survey we discovered    
 that among young people playing sports
 such as football,hockey or indoor     
 games, was the most common form of    
 recreation.{Youth Clubs}provided most 
 of these facilities for the young.They
 also provided discos and roller       
 skating.                              
 Ardnaveigh school operates an{Adult   
{club}where young adults and the       
 unemployed can also enjoy these       
 activities.                           
 Among the elderly gardening was a     
{popular hobby.}The local private      
 snooker club was also well subscribed.
 Few of the young people had a regular 
 hobby - some collected stamps.        </content>
