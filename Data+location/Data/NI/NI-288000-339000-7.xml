		<content>    My Dad Mr. William McConnell is a  
 dairy farmer who lives in the townland
 of Drumgaw.Altogether he farms 92     
 acres 52 of which are used for grazing
 and the remaining 40 are used for     
 silage.54 are in the Drumgaw area and 
 38 are in Ballymoran.                 
   {LIVESTOCK                          
 65 Friesian cows        15 Bullocks   
  7 Friesian heifers     35 Calves     
            1 Limousin bull            
 Although this is primarily a dairy    
 farm some cattle are reared for beef. 
 All farm work involves animal care and
 production of grass crops to feed     
 them.On average{the farmer works 13   
{hours per day}on six days of the week 
 and on{Sunday 7 hours.}He can only    
 have a few days holiday during which  
 he must pay a neighbour to look after 
 his stock. Much of his profit is      
 invested in the farm.                 </content>
