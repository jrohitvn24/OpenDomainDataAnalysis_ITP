		<content>     We made out questionnaires on the 
 stability of the Malone and           
 Stranmillis areas. We found that most 
 of the people liked living where they 
 did and had no desire to move. Most of
 the answers to the question{" Why do  
{you like living here? " were " Because
{its quiet, friendly and near shops."  
 In the Stranmillis area the majority  
 had lived there a number of years and 
 also preferred to remain there.       
{ Housing}                             
     We carried out a Housing survey   
 around the school. The majority of the
 housing was built around{1954.        
 Originally the area contained a       
 farmhouse and brick works.{Part}of the
 area contains much older housing and  
 was built in the{1920's}or{1930's.}The
 older housing is typical ribbon       
 development and  includes both terrace
 blocks and large detached houses.     </content>
