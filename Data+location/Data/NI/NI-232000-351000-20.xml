		<title>20Brougher Mountain Masts</title>
		<content>     On the top of Brougher Mountain   
 there is a relay station.It picks up  
 the television signals from the main  
 station in Belfast and transmitts them
 to this area.The area includes West   
 Tyrone and most of Fermanagh.         
     The station is jointly owned by   
 the BBC and ITV.It was built in the   
 early seventies and extended for BBC 2
 and Channel 4 in the early eighties.We
 can see from our school,a large       
 building,two high masts and a smaller 
 third mast.                           
     No one stays permanently.Engineers
 visit it weekly to check that         
 everything is in order.In Winter the  
 engineer sometimes stays overnight.   
     Occasionally people who pass      
 through the district go to have a look
 at the masts.They use the road up the 
 mountain built by the companies.
