		<content> THE SLAB IS BY NOW VERY SMOOTH WITH A 
 FAINT SHINE ON IT.  TO OBTAIN A FINAL 
 SHINE A FELT PAD WITH A POWDER IS     
 USED, PRODUCING A GREAT DEAL OF HEAT  
 WHICH SHINES THE STONE.               
 THE SLABS ARE THEN TAKEN FROM THIS    
 MACHINE TO AN AUTOMATIC SECONDARY SAW 
 WITH A 600 MM DIAMETER BLADE WHERE    
 THEY ARE CUT TO THE REQUIRED SIZE.    
 THE SIZE, SHAPE AND CUSTOMER'S NAME IS
 WRITTEN ON THE STONE AND IT IS THEN   
 TAKEN FOR SHAPING TO A MILLING        
 MACHINE.                              
 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES, FOR  
 EXAMPLE, BOOKS, HEARTS AND SCROLLS.   
 THE PROCESS REQUIRES MUCH WORK.  THE  
 MILLING MACHINES, LIKE THE SAWS, ARE  
 ALL DIAMOND TIPPED, AS DIAMOND IS THE 
 ONLY MATERIAL HARD ENOUGH TO CUT      
 GRANITE.  WHEN THE TOPS ARE SHAPED    
 THE NEXT PROCESS IS POLISHING THE     
 SIDES OF THE MONUMENT.                </content>
