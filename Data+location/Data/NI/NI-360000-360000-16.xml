  Kircubbin has grown up as a modern   
 market town serving the Mid-Ards. Its 
 growth began in the 1790's and by the 
 middle of the 19th. century had a     
 population of 600. It's name was      
 derived from Kilcubyn or Kilcooby     
 former townland names. Currently it is
 growing faster than any other village 
 in the Ards, especially the Parsonage 
 Road development.
