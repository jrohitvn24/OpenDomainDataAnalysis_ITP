		<title>09EMPLOYMENT IN EAST BANGOR</title>
		<content> There are few sources of employment in
 this area which is mainly residential.
      A small number of people find    
 employment in local shops in the      
 Ballyholme area of Bangor and in the  
 village of Groomsport.An even smaller 
 number are employed at Groomsport     
 harbour and at the Coastguard Station 
 at Orlock.                            
     Most workers in the area could be 
 described as white-collar workers.They
 travel to Belfast or other places of  
 work.Manual workers are few while     
 there are numerous civil servants,    
 policemen,prison officers,bank        
 officials,teachers,business-men and   
 administrators.                       
     Farms in the region are generally 
 family owned and usually small,giving 
 employment to very few people.
