		<content> Most of the housing in the area is    
 over occupied. Farm houses tend to be 
 two storied; built in the complex of  
 farm building however newer farm      
 dwellings are removed from farm       
 complexes and tend to be of the       
 bungalow type.                        
 There are very few "public sector"    
 houses in the area. Those that are    
 were originally built as labourers    
 cottages and recently improved. They  
 were recently offered for sale to the 
 sitting tenants at special prices and 
 many were bought. As they stand       
 detached in half an acre of land they 
 were a very sound investment as many  
 have recently been sold at a          
 substantial profit.                   
 There is little new building in the   
 area and no public sector building.
