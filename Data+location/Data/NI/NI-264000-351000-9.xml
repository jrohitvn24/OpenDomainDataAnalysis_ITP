		<content>{The Parish Church}in Moore St;built by
{Acheson Moore}in{1736,}has an         
 impressive spire,visible for many     
 miles around.                         
  In{1973 Christian Stewardship}was    
 introduced in the parishes of Carnteel
 and Crilly.Over 200 members heard it  
 defined as "The regarding of          
 ourselves,our time,our talents and    
 our money as a trust from God to be   
 used for his work in the world." After
 several speakers had expressed views  
 on different aspects of the campaign  
 the rector,Rev.J.M.Barton,summed up.As
 a result of stewardship many people   
 have become involved in church work   
 and financial committments have shown 
 a marked improvement.The premises next
 door,once used as the Belfast         
 Bank,have been converted into a       
 Church Hall,costing around Â£62 000.
