		<content> In response to development of the{"old
{village"}houses have become{"highly   
{desirable",}commercial interests have 
 developed shopping amenities, and     
 movement of population away from      
 Belfast and other towns has resulted  
 in the expansion of housing on the    
 perimeter.                            
     The effect on the native          
 population has been pretty drastic.As 
 the old people died the{escalating    
{cost of houses}have put them beyond   
 the reach of the younger generation   
 and in large numbers they have moved  
 out to Lisburn,Moira,etc..            
     The great problem confronting     
 Hillsborough today is that of         
 preserving a{sense of community}and   
 neighbourliness.It seems unlikely that
 we shall ever again know the "family  
 feeling" of the little village of     
 forty years ago.                      </content>
