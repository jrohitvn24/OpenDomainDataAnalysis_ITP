 It is estimated that it costs Â£7,500  
 per day to run the Ulsterbus          
 operations in Dungannon. Each bus in  
 the depot uses, on average, forty     
 eight litres of diesel fuel per day.  
 They are all serviced once a month in 
 the maintenance garages. A bus can be 
 expected to have a flat tyre six times
 in a year. Every year there are, on   
 average, thirty accidents involving   
 buses from the Dungannon depot,though 
 on the whole these are of a minor     
 nature. By far and away the biggest   
 expense lies in the payment of the    
 wages of the staff .There are fifty   
 two employees in Dungannon and with   
 the average weekly wage being in      
 excess of one hundred pounds, wages   
 account for over two thirds of running
 costs.                                </content>
