		<title>10A CATHOLIC COMMUNITY</title>
		<content> Religion plays a big part in my life. 
 The home, school and church work      
 together in our Religious Education.  
 All of the children around here are   
 Catholics and go to the Catholic      
 School. My home can easily be seen as 
 a Catholic  religious home because of 
 the pictures, the crucifix and the    
 family prayers. We pray before meals  
 and after, at bedtime and at special  
 times. Births,Birthdays, Christenings,
 Christmas, Easter and first reception 
 of the Sacraments are special times.  
 "When you're praying you must put your
 mind to your prayers and think of what
 you are saying". "In church looking   
 behind you is the worst form of bad   
 manners when you are supposed to look 
 at the altar and pray to God".Talk    
 like this goes on in the house.We are 
 taught to love, respect and forgive.  
 Everybody goes to Mass on Sunday.     </content>
