		<title>03HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</title>
		<content> The earliest evidence of the past can 
 be found in the townland of Tullygowan
 where a defensive{Rath}overlooks the  
 floodplain of the R.Maine.            
  The major settlement of this area was
 during the {plantation of Ulster}in   
 the 16th C.,when the forefathers of   
 most of the present farmers came from 
 Scotland having been given an area of 
 land.The many Scottish clan names     
 like-Mc Donald,Scott,and Cameron      
 together with the strong Presbyterian 
 Church tradition is evidence of this. 
  There was a settlement here in       
 pre-reformation times as old church   
 records state that in 1376 Paul was   
 rector of the parish of ST.Colmanellus
 of{Atholrill.}The ruins of this old   
 church can be found at the centre of  
 Ahoghill at the bottom of Church st.  
  The name Ahoghill comes from the     
 gaelic{Atha Thuathghail-Toughills Ford</content>
