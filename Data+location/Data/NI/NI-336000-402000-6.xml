		<content> In our area we have a several  primary
 schools,{Linn , Moyle, St.Antony's}and
{Antiville.}At secondary level there is
{Larne High School}and{Larne Grammar}In
 Northern Ireland our  schooling system
 is different from Britain as we have a
 state school while Roman Catholic boys
 and girls attend their own schools.   
                                       
 This is also one of the few areas with
{selection at 11+ .} In their last year
 at primary school the  pupils do tests
 to determine their suitability for the
 next stage of their education. It does
 not work in  practice as large numbers
 of pupils who come to secondary school
 follow{GCE Courses}and gain top grades
 in an  examination for which they were
 not considered capable.
