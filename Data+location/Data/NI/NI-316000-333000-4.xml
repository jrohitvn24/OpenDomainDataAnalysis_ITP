		<title>04BEEF FARMING IN RATHFRILAND</title>
		<content>   BEEF FARMING IS AN EVER GROWING     
 INDUSTRY. FARMERS BUY THEIR CALVES    
 WHEN THE ANIMALS ARE ABOUT 1.5 YEARS  
 OLD.THESE CALVES ARE USUALLY BOUGHT IN
 OCTOBER AND PUT STRAIGHT INTO A CATTLE
 HOUSE ALL WINTER.DURING THIS TIME THEY
 ARE FED SILAGE AND CONCENTRATES.      
   TO KEEP CATTLE OVER THE WINTER      
 MONTHS THE CATTLE MUST BE LOOKED AFTER
 AND SO THERE ARE SPECIAL SHEDS BUILT  
 TO BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE FARMER  
 AND TO KEEP THE CATTLE WARM AND       
 HEALTHY DURING THE COLD WEATHER. THE  
 CATTLE MUST ALSO HAVE PLENTY OF       
 VENTILATION.                          
   THE CATTLE ARE THEN GRAZED          
 THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER ON GOOD         
 GRASSLAND AND ARE FATTENED TO BE SOLD 
 IN SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER WHEN THEY     
 WEIGH ABOUT 600 - 700 kgs.            
                                       
                                       </content>
