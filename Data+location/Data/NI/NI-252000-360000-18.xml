 classroom 5 metres by 8 metres with   
 eight small windows in it,and a small 
 porch which was a cloakroom.The walls 
 were made of stone and it had a slated
 roof.The water was taken from a{well  
 by bucket over 200 metres away.The    
 toilets were outside at the bottom of 
 the playground.There was also a shed  
 to store turf and coal for the        
 fire.After it was built each pupil had

 heat the school.There was an open     
 fireplace.There was a{garden}beside   
 the school in which fruit and         
 vegetables grew.In January 1966 the   
 pupils left the old school and went to
