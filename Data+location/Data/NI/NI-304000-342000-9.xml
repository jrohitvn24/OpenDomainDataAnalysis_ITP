		<title>09SCARVA ORANGE HALL</title>
		<content> It is called this because it is used  
 by the Loyal Orange Men which we call 
 Orange Men.  The Orange Men use it for
 having meetings in, and when they come
 home on the 12th July they have a meal
 in it.                                
 It is a red brick building, and it    
 looks like a castle, It's big and it  
 has blue windows.  It is used on a    
 Friday or Saturday night for discos   
 and dancing.                          
 The Orange Hall is near our school.   
 The foundation stone was laid 1906.   
 It was opened by Mr. Henry Thompson's 
 wife .  It looks like Hampton Court   
 Palace in London.
