		<content> Our area is mostly rural but the      
 people who live in it would           
 identify with the small town of       
{Coalisland.}The town, population      
 approx.5,000 , owes its name to the   
 deposits of coal once mined in the    
 area, though its real growth was the  
 result of the opening of the{Tyrone   
{Canal}in 1744. The town was built     
 around the basin of the canal which   
 accounts for its odd shape.{Coalisland
 has a one sided  main street  and a   
 square which is really a triangle     
 shape.The outskirts of the town is    
 dominated by sand and clay pits which 
 contrast sharply with the rest of the 
 area.{Coalisland's}most famous son is 
{Denis Taylor, World Snooker Champion  
{1985.}The town will also be remembered
 as the starting point for the first
