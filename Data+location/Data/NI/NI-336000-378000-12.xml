		<title>12TRAFFIC CENSUS SURVEY</title>
		<content>      A Traffic Census Survey was      
 carried out on 13th March, 1985       
 between 8am and 9am at 20 vantage     
 points.  The purpose of the survey was
 to measure the peak traffic flow along
 the Through-Pass linking Bangor and   
 Belfast.                              
      The survey recorded the volume of
 traffic over a 24-hour period during a
 working day: the number of vehicles   
 from Belfast to Bangor was 12,607 and 
 from Bangor to Belfast was 13,649.    
 Several observations were made.  The  
 number of commuters entering Holywood 
 from all vantage points was 570 and   
 leaving Holywood was 1,050.  The      
 volume of traffic travelling from     
 Belfast along the Through-Pass via    
 Holywood to Bangor increased from 660 
 to 700 and the numbers of vehicles    
 travelling in the opposite direction  
 increased from 2,500 to 2,720.        </content>
