		<title>07FARM BUILDINGS</title>
		<content>  The most interesting building on Mr  
 Perry's farm is the milking parlour.  
 10 cows can be milk here at the same  
 time. The cows are brought here twice 
 a day to be milked, at six am and     
 again around six pm.                  
  The remainder of the buildings are   
 sheds for calves, or for the cattle   
 during the winter, or for keeping the 
 show cattle while they are being built
 up and groomed for the show. Ech show 
 has a cubicle in which it is kept.    
  An open shed is used to house farm   
 machinery which includes  three       
 tractors, a slurry tanker, a sprayer, 
 a roller, a manure sower and ploughs.
