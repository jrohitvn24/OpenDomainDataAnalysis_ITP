		<title>18O'Hara's Castle Portstewart</title>
		<content> Now St.Mary's Dominican College,Rock  
 Castle was originally built by Henry  
 O'Hara in 1834. It was three storeys  
 high and had a basement. There were 4 
 corner turrets two of which had       
 circular staircases. When Henry O'Hara
 died in 1844,the castle was extended. 
 The castle became the property of the 
 Cromie family,who lived at Cromore    
 House,before being bought from them by
 the Dominican Sisters in 1917.        
  They extended the castle in 1929 and 
 had a chapel added in 1935.           
  From 1963 to 1965 further extensions 
 were carried out to enlarge the       
 Convent school which is now a         
 college,catering for both boys and    
 girls from the age of 11 years to     
 18 years.                             
  Rock Castle is a prominent feature of
 the Portstewart coastline.
