		<title>10Brown's Bay Farm</title>
		<content> Brown' Bay Farm lies on the northern  
 tip of Islandmagee, a promontory which
 forms the eastern side of Larne Lough.
 The island people have traditionally  
 been involved in Farming and the Sea. 
 The farm that we visited comprises 125
 acres and is the remaining part of a  
 much larger farm.                     
 It has been in the family for four    
 generations.                          
 It is basically a dairy farm with a   
 herd of 120 cattle, of which 50 are   
 milking at the present time.          
 The breed is Friesian, kept because of
 the quantity and quality of the milk  
 they produce.                         
 The cows are milked twice a day, and  
 the milk goes by tanker to Ballycarry 
 Creamery, which is about 15 km away.
