		<content>   This block includes the eastern end 
 of Enniskillen, the unrivalled centre 
 of Co.Fermanagh. Enniskillen grew up  
 on an island as a Plantation and      
 garrison town which gave its name to  
 two famous regiments in the British   
 army.                                 
   To-day Enniskillen,with a population
 of 13,000, is a fine shopping and     
 business centre and this is reflected 
 in the block by the variety of shops. 
 It is also a market town serving the  
 farming community in the area as seen 
 by the lively weekly market and       
 farmers mart. Tourism, the most       
 important developing industry in the  
 area is catered for by a number of    
 fine hotels. An industrial estate has 
 been built to attract new industry.The

 converge in the area.
