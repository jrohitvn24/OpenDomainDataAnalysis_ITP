		<title>15"THE BELGRAVIA,"BELFAST 9.</title>
		<content> In the early 1980's it was reckoned   
 that about 20% of the population of   
 Belfast was aged 60 or over. For many 
 years the Housing Authorities have    
 been tackling the housing problems of 
 the city. One of the main problems was
 to provide modern homes for senior    
 citizens.                             
 The Belgravia Hotel on the Lisburn    
 Road had been home for some elderly   
 folk who did not want to live on their
 own. After a terrorist bomb,the       
 building had to be demolished. It was 
 then that the Northern Ireland Housing
 Association decided to use the site   
 for a complex of self-contained flats 
 for senior citizens.In May,1985 "The  
 Belgravia"was offically opened,       
 providing a beautiful home for 75     
 people. When we visited the home,     
 everyone said they were happy to have 
 such a lovely place to live in.       </content>
