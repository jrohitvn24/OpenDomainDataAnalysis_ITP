		<content> . Glastry is a typical small community
 in the Ards. There are two churches:  
 Glastry Presbyterian and manse,       
 Glastry Methodist and manse.          
  The choice of site was probably      
 determined by its central location in 
 the Peninsula. Around the churches has
 grown a small community of twelve     
 families. There are two farms, an     
 antiques business which opens only in 
 the evenings and weekends, and another
 converted farm complex which now      
 specializes in pottery and engraved   
 glass. Glastry House was once the     
 residence of the Savage family.       
                                       
   The situation right in the centre of
 the Peninsula was ideal for the       
 Churches. The Education Authorities   
 also recognized its potential when    
 they were choosing the site for a new 
 Secondary school in 1957.             </content>
