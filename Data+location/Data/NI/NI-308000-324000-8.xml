		<title>08SOCIAL CONCERNS IN NEWRY.</title>
		<content> The present Customs Clearance Station 
 causes traffic chaos on the           
 Newry-Dublin Rd. Lorries line the road
 no both sides causing congestion and  
 blocking entrances to homes.A new     
 bye-pass to Damolly, on Newry's north 
 side,is planned.It has met with much  
 opposition from residents of Damolly  
 and from farmers.                     
     Because of the "Troubles" many    
 people are leaving Derrybeg Estate.   
 Eleven vacant houses are up for sale  
 cheaply,costing Â£2,000 or Â£3,000 each.
 Some old wrecked houses,vacant for 5  
 years,will be demolished and a shop   
 built in their place.                 
     A home has just been opened in    
 Patrick St.It is for people who have  
 been treated for mental illness and   
 then discharged.There are twelve      
 residents.
