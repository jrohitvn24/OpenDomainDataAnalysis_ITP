		<content> The fragile nature of most of the     
 vegetation cover on the sand dunes and
 the unstable nature of the sand       
 beneath means that overuse or abuse of
 the system usually leads to consider- 
 able erosion and damage. For this     
 reason, much of the management of the 
 Reserve serves to channel people in   
 order to restrict damage to a small   
 area. A major headache for the Wardens
 is the increasing use of small, off-  
 the-road, scrambles bikes and wide-   
 tyred dune bikes. These are difficult 
 to catch and can do considerable      
 damage. Horse-riding is permitted     
 along certain paths, although this is 
 by permit only. Further, almost       
 uncontrollable damage is done to the  
 seaward face of the dunes by          
 picnickers burrowing into the sand to 
 avoid the wind. Thatching with dead   
 Sea Buckthorn has reduced this problem</content>
