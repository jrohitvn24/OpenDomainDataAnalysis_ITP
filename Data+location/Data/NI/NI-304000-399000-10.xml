		<content> Although there are few large wild     
 animals like badgers and foxes as this
 is an intensive farming area, there   
 is at present a large population of   
 both{rabbits and brown rats}which live
 in the hedge banks and water ditches. 
{Hedgehogs}can still be seen, though   
 often they are killed on roads by cars
  {Moorhens}and {curlews}are nesting on
 the bogland while a few crows nest in 
 the high trees. However,the bird      
 population is also to be found in the 
 hedgerows which provide good shelter. 
 Here there is a very wide aray of     
 smaller birds,which are also seen in  
 the village gardens e.g.{hedgesparrow,
{blackbird,thrushes and starlings.}    
  The river Maine is famous for its    
 fishing because of the good stocks of 
{brown trout,eels and salmon.}         
 The small streams are used as spawning
 grounds and for catching{sticklebacks.</content>
