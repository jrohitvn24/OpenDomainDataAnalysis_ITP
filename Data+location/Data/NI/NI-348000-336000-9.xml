		<title>09ARABLE FARMING</title>
		<content> Arable Farming is not very important  
 in this area. Barley is the principal 
 crop and it is gorwn mainly as fodder 
 _ it is crushed and fed to the stock. 
 Potatoes are grown for household use  
 mainly but they are also grown        
 commercially. Merchants from the      
 Mourne area of Co. Down lease land in 
 this area as it is free               
 fromwire_worm. They grow large        
 quantities of seed potatoes for       
 export.Little local labour is         
 employed as the operation is          
 largely mechanised and any            
 labour required is brought in         
 from the merchant home area of        
 Mourne.                               
 Silage is grown on a large scale      
 and is used with barley as            
 winter fodder.
