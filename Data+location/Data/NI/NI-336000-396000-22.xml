<title>22Toreagh Primary School</title>
<content>

Toreagh Primary is a small, rural school and is well known by all the citizens of Raloo. The intake has increased a lot in the last 25 years. At the moment we have 95 pupils. Our school has 3 full-time teachers (one of them is the head teacher), 3 part-time teachers, 4 classroom assistants and a secretary. &lt;br />&lt;br />The building had a Â£300,000 extension in 2003. We have 4 classrooms, a staffroom, a library, an office, a special needs room, an assembly hall, 2 sets of children's toilets, 2 teacher's toilets, 2 cleaner's stores, 3 normal stores, a shelter, outdoor equipment, a storage cabin, a small car park and an outside classroom. Outside we have a playground, a field, a pond and a vegetable patch which take up a vast amount of area. All of these are taken care of by the eco-club members.&lt;br />&lt;br />The subjects we do are literacy, numeracy, World Around Us, R.E., P.E., Personal Development and Mutual Understanding (PDMU), mental maths, topic maths, Spanish, heartstart, art and writing. We get a written homework along with spellings and reading from Monday to Thursday. Over the weekend we have no homework. After school we have clubs, such as hockey, football and eco-club. During school some pupils learn to play different instruments e.g. clarinet, violin and recorder.&lt;br />&lt;br />We have to sit 3 tests to decide which secondary school we will move on to. Pupils with the highest marks get accepted into the schools first. Most pupils from Toreagh move on to Larne Grammar, Larne High, Downshire, Ballyclare High and Ballyclare Secondary.&lt;br />&lt;br />Toreagh is fun and educational with smiles wherever you go from both the teachers and the pupils. :-)&lt;br />&lt;br />By Ellen and Ella P6 </content>
