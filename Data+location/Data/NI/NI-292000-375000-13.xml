		<title>13LAMAS FAIR IN ARDBOE</title>
		<content> Lamas fair is a time for celebration  
 and enjoyment.It is in the holidays.  
    Years ago,in my grandmother's time 
 they would have horses for sale and   
 they called it a{horse fair.}But      
 nowadays we have parachuting,         
 horse-riding and a few{stalls}selling 
{yellow man,Peggy's leg ,Lamas}cake and
 edible seaweed called dulse and other 
  foods.We can buy toys there too.     
     People come from many different   
 parts to celebrate this special       
 tradition.In 1973 people attempted to 
 turn Lamas into a parochial fund-     
 raising fete held on a weekend in     
 August.This is slowly dying away again
 but the real Old Lamas fair on the    
{2nd. August}still goes on.            
 The word Lamas is said to mean{LOAF   
{MASS }but it was originally a pagan   
 festival held at mid-summer,going back
 much further than 2000 years.         </content>
