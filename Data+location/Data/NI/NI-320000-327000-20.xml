		<title>20RELIGION IN HILLTOWN</title>
		<content> In Hilltown there are 3 religions.The 
{Catholic}religion which I am part of  
 the{presbyterian}religion and the     
{Church Of Ireland}The main religion is
 Catholic which we know by comparing   
 the number in the  Catholic school and
 the number in the Presbyterian.The    
 smallest religion is the Church Of    
 Ireland .There are only about 4       
 families of this religion in Hilltown 
 and all their children go to a school 
 in Rathfriland.There are two catholic 
 chapels in Hilltown.One is called St  
 John the Bapist and the other is      
 called St John the Evangelist.Most    
 Presbyterians go to a meeting house   
 and some go to a free Presbyterian    
 church in Ballyronney which is just   
 outside Hilltown.Others go to a Non   
 subscribing which is called Clonduff.
