{called James Marshal.}His forge was   
 along the main Londonderry ,Belfast   
 road.It is now a cowshed. The bridge  
 is sixteen metres long and made up of 
 sixteen wrought iron crosses each one 
 metre long metre long the floor is    
 made of wood. His name is engraved    
 on iron. It was built so people could 
 come to school and church across the  
{Faughan}without having to go miles to 
 the nearest road bridge. It is six    
 steps up from the ground at one side  
 and level at the other side.
