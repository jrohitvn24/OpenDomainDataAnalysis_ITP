		<title>09Social Concern in Dungiven</title>
		<content> There is concern about the rise in    
 vandalism,possible drug_taking,glue_  
 sniffing and under_age drinking.This  
 is accompanied by apathy towards the  
 Church,which in the past in this area 
 was unthinkable.                      
 Being on the main Belfast_Derry route 
 the volume of traffic through Dungiven
 is quite alarming and with sections of
 the main street quite narrow the      
 situation is almost chaotic.A by_pass 
 had been planned but had to be shelved
 because of lack of public finance.    
 Litter is a problem not only in the   
 village after discos etc.but also in  
 the countryside and especially in     
 beautiful areas near the River Roe and
 in secluded spots in the surrounding  
 hills.A local committee is trying to  
 educate people to take a pride in     
 their area and some success has been  
 achieved.                             </content>
