		<title>06An Adult's Morning.</title>
		<content>       This is an example of my        
 father's day.It starts at 8.20am when 
 he gets up.He washes and then dresses 
 normally in trousers,a jumper,a shirt,
 and a tie.At about 8.30am he shaves.  
 Shaving is followed by breakfast which
 consists of porridge,tea and toast.At 
 8.50am he leaves the house to walk    
 about a quarter of a mile to the local
 primary school.                       
       He works there as a teacher.When
 he arrives he checks the mail and at  
 9.10 rings the bell for school to     
 begin.As he is headmaster he teaches  
 the top two classes,P6 and P7.        
 Altogether there are about thirty     
 children in the two classes.At 12.15pm
 there is a break for the two course   
 lunch which he takes in the school    
 dining hall.
