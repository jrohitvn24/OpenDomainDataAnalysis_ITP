		<title>11Entertainment: Gilford</title>
		<content> In Gilford there is no theatre, opera,
 cinema or music hall. In the G.C.C.   
 hall they have discos, dancing, bingo 
 and parties. At the disco they put on 
 the flash-lights and they have coke   
 and crisps. They have dances in the   
 hall for pensioners and they enjoy it.
 Sometimes they have outings for       
 pensioners to the beach or somewhere  
 like that. At Christmas they have     
 parties in the G.C.C. hall for        
 children and adults. They have films  
 and dances for the children. some of  
 the children enjoy it because they get
 sweets and crisps and lemonade. The   
 G.C.C. hall is used for many things   
 like meetings and Youth Clubs. Every  
 Thursday the girls go to the Youth    
 Club for a bit of sport. Some of the  
 girls have to bring a pair of roller  
 boots to skate around on.
