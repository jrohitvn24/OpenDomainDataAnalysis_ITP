		<title>19THE CHURCHES</title>
		<content>    In 1985 church affairs are often   
 news in N.Ireland. In fact in this    
 area, as in many others, the churches 
 co-exist peacefully and with mutual   
 respect, which is something of a      
 tradition locally. It cannot be said  
 that there is no trace at all of the  
 polarisation which the media so often 
 present as the Ulster disease; but it 
 is so muted by common consent as to be
 barely perceptible. This has to be due
 to a greater or lesser extent to the  
 ministers of the different            
 denominations. They are at present,   
    Rev. Oliver Thompson,C of I.       
    Rev. John O'Sullivan, R.C.         
    Rev. Hazzard, Methodist.           
      Each church has a full active    
 Christian life caring for the old,    
 sick, less fortunate. All help        
 annually with Civic Week.Info. re     
 Services etc. is easily available.    </content>
