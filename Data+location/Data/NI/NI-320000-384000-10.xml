		<title>10My Summer Holidays</title>
		<content> During my summer holidays I hope to   
 have my cousin Brian up from Donegal. 
 I hope he brings his B.M.X. bike and  
 his fishing rod so we can go for bike 
 rides and go fishing. I also hope to  
 go away for a weekend with Christopher
 Scarlett to Ballywalter. I hope we go 
 out in his fishing boat to do some    
 fishing.                              
 I am going to Jersey on my holidays. I
 looked at a brochure on the on the    
 many intresting things to see.I would 
 like to see the German underground    
 hospital used during the Second World 
 War when the Germans captured the     
 island.They had it for 5 years.Also I 
 would like to see a museum which has  
 guns etc.used by the Germans in the
