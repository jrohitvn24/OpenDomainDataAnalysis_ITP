		<title>04LISDOART FLAX MILL</title>
		<content> The Lisdoart mill was erected by the  
 local landlord, George Vesey Stewart. 
 He erected the mill in 1864 and it    
 gave employment to 200 people and in  
 the long run many more.               
    Along with milling enterprises     
 Stewart also tried to set up an       
 industrial village. He built a terrace
 of houses and a factory and he also   
 introduced his own currency, the      
 Lisdoart "quoits".                    
  The spinning enterprise ended when   
 Stewart, now nearly bankrupt as a     
 result of his investment in the mill  
 started an enterprise in New Zealand. 
 The mill was taken over by John Hurst 
 and it stayed in action until 1914.   
 After this it became disused. Today   
 the mill is of some use (refer to page
 15).
