		<title>05FARMING METHODS.</title>
		<content>    Since most of the land was pasture,
 there was little need for ultra modern
 techniques.Tractors, ploughs,chemical 
 fertilizers were used when required.  
 Though obviously in the case of       
 McBride's farm,milking machines       
 were used and the highest standards of
 hygiene and cleanliness were observed.
    Many of the farms had to make use  
 of {HYDRAULIC RAMS}to pump water up   
 the hills to their homes.The principal
 means of transport is the landrover   
 for getting about farmland,and cars   
 for travelling to Glengormley or      
 further afield.Public transport though
 available was inconvenient and usually
 some distance from the farms.         
    However of the people interviewed, 
 no one,and especially children,seemed 
 to mind living in the countryside.    
 Indeed only in winter do they         
 complain.                             </content>
