		<title>08RIDING SCHOOL SAFETY</title>
		<content> The school is very conscious of safety
 at all times. Particular attention is 
 paid to the importance and choice of  
 the correct headgear and safety       
 helmets, and of the proper footwear.  
                                       
 Under no circumstances are 'training  
 shoes' permitted; riding boots or     
 'wellington boots' must be worn. In   
 the event of an accident, if the rider
 is wearing 'trainers', there is a real
 danger of their foot being caught in  
 the stirrup and being dragged along by
 the horse.                            
                                       
 The school has no objection to casual 
 clothes being worn by beginners, but  
 most people learning to ride prefer to
 wear the proper set of jodhpurs,      
 riding boots and helmet.
