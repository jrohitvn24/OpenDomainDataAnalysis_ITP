		<title>04Shopping in Enniskillen.</title>
		<content>   The shopping area includes Belmore &amp;
 Forthill St. These are outside the    
 main CBD. During the past 10 Years,   
 these areas have increased in         
 importance for shopping, especially   
 since the town centre is closed off to
 traffic after 6pm. These streets are  
 accessible to pedestrians &amp; traffic at
 all times &amp; therefore we find a large 
 number of fast food shops,            
 restaurants, pubs &amp; newsagents. They  
 benefit from this location with most  
 trade during evenings &amp; weekends.     
   Our newest shop is Wellworths, a    
 large variety chain store, which      
 attracts customers from all over      
 Fermanagh &amp; bordering counties. Prices
 are competitive. Its location creates 
 parking &amp; traffic problems. We also   
 find our larger hardware stores which 
 require good sites &amp; easy access, as  
 do our main garage dealers for BL etc.</content>
