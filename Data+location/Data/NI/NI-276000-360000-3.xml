		<title>03NEW INDUSTRY IN DUNGANNON</title>

 They are all relatively small units   
 each employing less than fifty        
 people. The changing pattern of       
 industry has shown a move away from   
 large factories, making similar       
 products, to smaller units            
 manufacturing a wider range of goods. 
 One of the major industrial successes,
 over the last fifteen years has been  
 the establishment of a full lead      
 crystal glass industry centred in     
 Dungannon town. Glass making had been 
 carried on in this area over two      
 hundred years ago but little evidence 
 of it remains.{Tyrone Crystal}was     
 founded in 1970 by a local priest     
 called Father Austin Eustace and      
 originally employed twelve people. It 
 was owned by about three hundred local
 share holders and did not really get  
 off the ground.                       </content>
