		<title>08Customs in Cullyhanna.</title>
		<content> There are many local customs in this  
 area which the people hold on to and  
 are proud of.The most popular one is  
 the making of the St. Brigid crosses  
 for 1st February,her feast day.St     
 Brigid was born at Faughart,near      
 Dundalk,about 10 miles from           
 here.Rushes are gathered in the fields
 and woven by hand into the shape of a 
 cross.These are blessed and hung in   
 the homes.Farmers hang them in their  
 outhouses and sheds to protect their  
 property and stock.It is customary for
 people to visit the graves of their   
 relatives and friends every Sunday and
 once a year the graves are blessed    
 during a special ceremony.There is a  
 Parish Mission every three            
 years.Visiting priests come for a     
 week,say two Masses each morning,visit
 the sick and have Devotions in the    
 evening.Everyone attends the Mission. </content>
