		<title>02The Quarry</title>
		<content> When the Quarry was established in    
 1921, by Mr James McBriar he employed 
 quite a number of people and in those 
 days it was all manual labour as there
 were no machines as there is today.   
 During the 1939 - 45 War it was taken 
 over by the Army so that they could   
 get stones to make a runway for a     
 nearby aerodrome.  In 1950, Brendan   
 Boal took over and then Mr Wilber     
 Linton in 1969. Before taking over the
 Quarry Mr Linton was a lorry driver.  
 The Quarry now employs 10 men and has 
 five lorries on the road. The stones  
 from this Quarry are used all over    
 Northern Ireland  in the building of  
 houses, hospitals, factories and      
 schools.
