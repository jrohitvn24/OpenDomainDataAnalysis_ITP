		<title>02Life in a Boarding School</title>
		<content> I go to a boarding school, which means
 that I live in school instead of going
 home in the afternoons, as my home is 
 too far away from school to travel    
 from each day. Being a boarder is good
 fun at times but sometimes it is very 
 boring. In the summer afternoons I    
 play cricket in the nets, or play     
 football on the field. We can watch TV
 from 4.45 until 5.15. Then after we   
 have done our homework from 6_7pm we  
 can go out again or watch TV. The     
 breakfast or dinner routine differs   
 from what happens at my home. In      
 schoo we have to get up at 7.30 in the
 morning to have breakfast but at home 
 I get up when I like and eat what I   
 like. I enjoy the company of the other
 boys during the term, but I have      
 friends at home as well.
