		<content>   RATHFRILAND'S LOCAL NEWSPAPER 'THE  
 OUTLOOK' WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1940 AND  
 AT THIS TIME ,ONLY COST ONE OLD PENNY.
 IT HAD NEVER ANY LOCAL NEWSPAPER TO   
 COMPETE WITH.                         
   IN THE PRODUCTION OF A NEWSPAPER,   
 THE WRITTEN COPY IS SET UP AND TYPED. 
 IT IS THEN PROOFED AND READ. NEXT IT  
 IS PASTED ONTO THE PAPER,PHOTOGRAPHED 
 AND PLATED. THESE ARE THEN PLACED IN  
 THE PRINTING MACHINE AND THE REQUIRED 
 NUMBER OF COPIES OF EACH PAGE ARE     
 PRINTED.THE PAGES ARE LOADED ONTO A   
 FOLDING MACHINE AND FOLDED INTO A     
 COMPLETED PAPER.                      
   EACH WEEK APPROXIMATELY 10,000      
 COPIES ARE PRINTED AND CIRCULATED.    
   A LOCAL NEWSPAPER HAS AN ADVANTAGE  
 IN THAT IT DEALS ONLY WITH ITS OWN    
 AREA AND GIVES LOCAL NEWS IN DEPTH.
