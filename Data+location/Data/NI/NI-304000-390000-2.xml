		<content> The predominant physical feature      
 marked in the map is the{Upper        
{Craigmore Quarry. }This is not now in 
 operation except for occasional loads 
 of loose stones (Basalt) and quarry   
 dust being extracted by a small       
 tractor-digger.  The last quarry      
 machinery for stone processing was    
 removed about two years ago.          
                                       
 There was a farm to the south of the  
 marked{Craigmore Quarries}which was   
 purchased for quarrying in the early  
 1970's and the works are now          
 abandoned.  This site has aroused     
 considerable controversy in the       
 neighbourhood as a result of{Antrim   
{Borough Council's}application to place
 a refuse tip in the abandoned quarry.
