		<title>08SHOPPING DAY</title>
		<content> Saturday is shopping day. First we    
 call for my granny and then we go to  
 Stewart's for our crisps.  After that 
 my granny goes to pay her television  
 rent.  Next I go and get my comics    
 while my granny and mummy go to the   
 bakery.  There my mum gets sausage    
 rolls and buns.  Every month my mummy 
 would go into Tweedys and pay the     
 clothes bill or look out something for
 one of the family.  While mum, gran   
 and I are away, daddy goes and gets   
 the meat from my great uncle's butcher
 shop.  After that we would drive to   
 Smith's car park and go and get our   
 food from the supermarket.  We would  
 get a big trolley and fill it with    
 food for the week.  Then we would have
 to wait in a queue to pay.  My daddy  
 and I would pack it all while my      
 mummy would get the food out of the   
 trolly.   WRITTEN BY KIRSTY (aged 11) </content>
