		<title>20LIFE ON A FARM</title>
		<content>                                       
   I live on a small farm about five   
miles outside Limavady. Every morning  
my father gets up at 7.00 to feed the  
animals. We have pigs, cows and hens.  
   My father also works as a builder   
during the rest of the day. At that    
time my mother feeds the hens and      
brings in the eggs.                    
   From May the piglets are born and   
my brother and I take turns to watch   
them at night.                         
   In the winter we bring hay to the   
cattle in the sheds, I find this very  
hard work.                             
   At the end of our day's work it is  
back to feeding the animals before     
homework and bed.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
