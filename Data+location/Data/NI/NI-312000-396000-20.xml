		<title>20Hopes For The Future</title>
		<content> Our class of thirty pupils conducted a
 survey of their parents on what their 
 hopes were for the future.They hoped  
 that there would be prosperity and    
 peace in Ireland and that children    
 would find employment.Parents also    
 hoped that there would be a cure for  
 Cancer and other diseases and that    
 there would be less strikes.They hoped
 there would be no nuclear war and that
 nuclear weapons would be              
 destroyed.They also hoped there would 
 be no starvation and there would be   
 enough food to feed everyone.Parents  
 hoped that more people would go to    
 church and there would be more        
 recreation for children.              
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
