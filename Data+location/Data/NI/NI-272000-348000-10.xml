  In our area there is one church      
 building, which is{Minterburn         
{Presbyterian.}The church is a T_shaped
 stone building.The congregation of    
{presbyterians}gathered together in    
 1657, and the church was built some   
 time later. The vestry was added      
 recently, and appears to be built of  
 cement blocks. The slated roof is     
 pitched. There are 11 windows, two of 
 which are stained glass. Unlike the   
 windows in most houses, they are all  
 arch shaped and about 4 metres high.  
 The wooden doors are also arch shaped.
 There are many interesting old head-  
 stones in the graveyard. One marble   
 stone, close to the church door, is in
 memory of the{Clow}family. It is      
 intriguing that this family was born  
 in Scotland.{James Clow}died on 9th   
 June 1892.                            </content>
