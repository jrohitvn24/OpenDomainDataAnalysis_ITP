		<title>14THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> The blue carpet in the church is in   
 memory of Dennis Wilson(already       
 mentioned)presented by his parents.   
 The congregation also donated the east
 doors in memory of Dennis Wilson. The 
 lights in the church, were a gift of  
 Francis Wright Howey in memory of his 
 family.The reading lights over the    
 pulpit are copper and brass and       
 although now converted to electricity,
 were once oil lamps. There is a new   
 baptismal font in the memory of       
 Joseph Ligget who died on the third   
 September 1984.It was dedicated on his
 birthday in March. When we visited the
 church it had not been used, but by   
 the time of writing this the first    
 baptism has taken place-of Linda      
 Caroline Loughrin .Inside a display   
 case the  old communion vessels are on
 show.They appear to be made of pewter.
