		<content> Lady of the Lake is a festival held in
 Irvinestown each year.Legend tells us 
 that a beautiful lady went from island
 to island wearing flowing white gowns 
 and a blue cape and she brought luck  
 and good weather.Every year some young
 ladies enter a competition to select a
 Lady of the Lake.Two girls are chosen 
 as her maidens of honour.The Lady of  
 the Lake comes through the town in a  
 boat towed by a car ;her head covered 
 to hide her identity. Her maidens then
 follow her in a pony and trap and she 
 is revealed on the clock tower.As part
 of the festival there is dancing and  
 singing in the street.The Fancy Dress 
 Parade is one of the highlights and   
 each evening there is a talent contest
 in one of the bars with the final held
 in the Townhall on the last night.The 
 festival attracts locals and visitors 
 to the donkey derby and sports events.</content>
