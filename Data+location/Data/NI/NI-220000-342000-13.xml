		<title>13A TYPICAL FARM:ENNISKILLEN</title>
		<content>  Mr.Brown owns a farm at{BODARRA BIG. 
 He is a typical farmer in the area.The
 farm is 32 acres in size.On the farm  
 he keeps 25 dairy cattle giving an    
 average yield of 1000 gallons per     
 annum.The cattle are all Friesian and 
 give a good yield.Being a dairy farm  
 requires milking the cattle twice a   
 day.This is done with portable milking
 machines in the byre.He has not built 
 a milking parlour but he says that if 
 he stays in dairying he will have to. 
   The land is grassland whuch has not 
 been reseeded but has been improved by
 drainage and fertilizer.It is mown    
 regularly and gives good silage for   
 his cattle. He also,like many other   
 farmers ,has more land rented,in this 
 case 35 acres.On this rented land he  
 keeps beef and store cattle.He grows  
 no crops,not even potatoes for home   
 consumption,it's cheaper to buy them. </content>
