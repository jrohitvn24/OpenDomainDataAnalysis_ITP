 member of the first form in Kilkeel   
 High School. A typical schoolday for  
 me begins when I get up at 7.30am and 
 put on my school uniform. My mum gets 
 up before me and she sets the table   
 for breakfast, which is a bowl of     
 cereal, toast and a mug of tea. I     
 clean my teeth, pack my books and wait
 for a lift from my friend's dad.      
  Today is Thursday and roll-call is at
 8.50am followed by form assembly.     
 Classes start at 9.15am which for my

 recorder but the bell rang and we left
 for Geography. Today we were studying 
 the Index of Connectivity with Mr.

 during which I played tennis with my  
 friend William and I won!             
  In Biology we looked at flowers      </content>
