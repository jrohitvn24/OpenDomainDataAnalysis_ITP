		<content> The area covered by this block is not 
 one of great economic importance.     
 Neither is it one of great social     
 significance.But we,as the inhabitants
 of the region,see it as one of emense 
 natural beauty and friendly welcoming 
 people.It is probably not a place in  
 which one could persuade an impartial 
 stranger to settle down.But it is a   
 place where one is loath to leave for 
 too long,and where one is always      
 welcomed back.                        
  Perhaps that is a purely biased      
 opinion,as we,the writers, are members
 of the community,and would therefore  
 also be the "friendly welcoming       
 people" mentioned above.
