		<content> Apart from the Slievenaman ridge, the 
 hedgerows and ditches provide the main
 natural habitats. These are           
 characterised by weed species, grasses
 and trees such as hawthorn, blackthorn
 and gorse.                            
 Several fields have a thorn (a Fairy  
 Thorn) inside the field, superstition 
 preventing its removal. Often it is   
 made use of by being the 'dump' for   
 stones. Field boundaries vary from    
 modern fences to hedges and dry stone 
 walls. The walls are either made of   
 glacially rounded boulders or sharply 
 angular pieces of Silurian shale, the 
 local bedrock. The area has many small
 fields. Few field boundaries have been
 abandonned, most amalgamations of     
 fields  are effected by knocking a    
 whole through the wall of hedge and   
 allowing the rest to fall down.
