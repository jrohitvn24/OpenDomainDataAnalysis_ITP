		<title>03BALLYNURE CHURCHES</title>
		<content> There are 3 churches in{Ballynure,}all
 of different denominations,to meet the
 requirements of the local  population.
  The{Parish church (Church of Ireland)
 was one  of  the  earliest churches in
 the area . The first parish church was
 built in  1603 and was  preached in by
{Jonathan Swift }who later  became Dean
 of{St Patricks  Cathedral ,Dublin.}The
 original church is now in ruins.      
   The{Presbyterian church}in Ballynure
 was built in 1725 to fill a need for a
 church members to worship in their own
 areas. Before this church they  had to
 walk to Raloo  village (near Larne) to
 worship. Since  1922 the  presbyterian
 church spire  has  been  rebuilt three
 times.                                
    The {Methodist church}is relatively
 the youngest being built in 1846.
