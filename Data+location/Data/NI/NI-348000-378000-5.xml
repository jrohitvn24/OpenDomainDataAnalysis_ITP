		<title>05TRAFFIC SURVEY _ CONCLUSIONS</title>
		<content> 1.In 30 minutes 90 more vehicles used 
   the "Ring-Road".                    
 2.In this time 1300 vehicles would    
   have travelled through Bangor past  
   the two points,(not 605),if the     
   "Ring-Road" was not there.          
 3.Fewer two-wheeled vehicles used the 
   "Ring-Road" where traffic is faster.
 4.Twice as many lorries and almost 1.5
   more vans went along the "Ring-Road"
   perhaps taking goods to or from the 
   Balloo Industrial Estate,to Belfast 
   or the 'Ards Peninsula.             
 5.More vehicles travelled west along  
   the "Ring-Road". Perhaps the traffic
   was going to Belfast,taking the dual
   carriage-way to Newtownards or some 
   may have been going to a hypermarket
{From our findings it seems that the   
 "Ring-Road"{built 17 years ago is     
{still carrying out its purpose        
{effectively.              }P.6 PUPILS.</content>
