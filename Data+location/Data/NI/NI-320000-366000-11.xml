		<content>{LIMESTONE LODGE+QUARRY}-Moneybroom Rd 
  Today there are ruins of a large     
 house and four lime kilns with a      
 disused quarry nearby.                
  In the 1740s lime was used as a      
 fertilizer for the first time in      
 Ireland at the nearby Brookhill estate
 This most likely led to the           
 establishment of the quarry and       
 lime-preparation industry here.       
  At the end of 18th.C.the lodge and   
 land was owned by a George Thompson.  
 There is evidence than this was once  
 quite a substantial lime-preparation  
 concern.Industrial buildings and      
 disused items of machinery are still  
 in evidence.                          
  Local residents can remember the four
 kilns in full operation as recently as
 the 1940s.
