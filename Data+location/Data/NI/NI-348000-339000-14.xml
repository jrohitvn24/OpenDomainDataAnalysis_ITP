 or twelve with little education to    
 work in the fields and later many     
 emigrated to England to look for work 
 as machinery made farming easier.There
 is a big difference in ploughing with 
 a horse and ploughing with a          
 tractor!There weren't any of these    
 super-stores about either.The women   
 baked the bread,milked the cows,made  
 the butter and spent as little as     
 possible in the shops.There wasn't    
 much money around and a pair of shoes 
 or a suit of clothes had to last for  
 years.We walked everywhere in those   
 days or shared a bicycle wiyh a couple
 of friends when going to town or to   
 football matches.But things were      
 cheaper then too.We had a halfpenny   
 loaf and could buy four buns for a    
 penny.There are many changes,children 
 are very lucky nowadays.              </content>
