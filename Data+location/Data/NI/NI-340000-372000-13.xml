		<title>13A DAY IN MY LIFE cont.</title>
		<content> Occasionally unusual visitors ,like   
 the photographer,call at school,and   
 last week some P7's were given their  
 B.C.G. vacination by the doctor.      
 Fortunately I wasn't one of them.     
   At three o'clock school ends and I  
 rushed home to do my homework as today
 I was anxious to watch my favourite   
 T.V programme Dungeons and Dragons.   
 When it was over I went up to the     
 nearby fields to play with my cousin  
 Richard . We lit a fire and I fell    
 into a river so my mother scolded me  
 and sent me to bed early.
