		<title>16THE KNOCKAHOLLET MOTTE</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 In our area there is a{motte and      
{bailey fort.}The motte is a big mound 
 of earth, and the bailey is a ring of 
 earth all round the motte. This fort  
 was built by a Norman knight,{Sir John
{de Courcy,}as his men marched north   
 through this area around the{year     
{1200.}                                
 At that time, the natives of Co.      
 Antrim would have attacked Sir John so
 the Normans built these forts for     
 protection. They always put them on a 
 hill with a good view in all          
 directions so that the natives could  
 be watched. The sides were steep and ,
 at first, there was a high fence all  
 round the top.                        
 There are a number of these forts in  
 Co. Antrim, but the one in our area is
 well preserved.                       </content>
