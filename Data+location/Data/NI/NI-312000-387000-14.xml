		<content>{FAMILY  LIFE:}   In our family one    
 Saturday is just like another.I get   
 up, take the cover from the  budgie   
 cage then get my cereal.Now the       
 rest of the family are coming down .We
 children do the housework.Mum makes   
 sure of that.I think mum plays a major
 part in keeping the house clean and   
 tidy.Mum and dad go out to wash the   
 car ready for going down town to get  
 meat for Sunday dinner.I get Â£1.50    
 pocket money which has to do the      
 whole week.I  usually have mine spent 
 by Sunday and then need more.Back from
 the town we get hamburgers,beans and  
 chips.Next I go out on my bicycle with
 my friends.We all get money and go to 
 a local shop and get sweets and then  
 watch T.V.until supper time.Daddy and 
 I get a curry and a portion of chips. 
 Once the clock strikes 10 00p.m. we   
 children go to bed.                   </content>
