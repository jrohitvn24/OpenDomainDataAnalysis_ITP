		<content> Whilst the general subjects such as   
 maths,english,nature-study,geography, 
 and history are still taught,there    
 is much more emphasis on practical    
 work like art,craft,cookery,P.E.etc.  
 The teaching of these subjects takes  
 place in a less regimented atmosphere 
 than in the past,with the result that 
 all pupils are encouraged to give of  
 their best,and find things out for    
 themselves. Although discipline at the
 school is quite strict,the pupils and 
 teachers enjoy a happy relationship.  
 Uniform is not compulsory,but most    
 parents find it convenient and        
 practical for their children.The girls
 uniform consists of a grey pinafore,  
 white blouse and grey cardigan or     
 jumper; the boys wear grey trousers,  
 grey shirt and grey jumper. School    
 ties are black,navy and white.
