		<title>05Education in Portstewart</title>
		<content> The town is served by two primary     
 schools-St.Colum's Maintained Primary 
 School and Portstewart Controlled     
 Primary School. The only Secondary    
 school in the town is Dominican       
 College which draws its intake mainly 
 from St.Colum's and                   
 St.Patrick's,Portrush-although some   
 pupils also go from Portstewart       
 Controlled Primary. Pupils from       
 St.Colum's who do not transfer to     
 Dominican will go to St.Joseph's      
 Secondary School in Coleraine. The    
 boys from the controlled primary go to
 either Coleraine Academical           
 Institution or the Boys Secondary     
 while the girls go to Coleraine High  
 School or the Girls Secondary School. 
 A few children go to Dalriada in      
 Ballymoney or Dunluce in Bushmills.   
 Throughout secondary schooling most   
 children must travel daily by bus.    </content>
