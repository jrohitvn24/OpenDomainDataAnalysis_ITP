		<title>10HOME LIFE IN SCARVA</title>
		<content> At 7.55 a m, I get up to go to school.
  I dress myself and then I make my own
 breakfast.                            
 The breakfast I have is usually       
 porridge or cornflakes.  When I am    
 doing that my mummy is calling Stewart
 or dressing him.  When I am finished I
 get my books together and put  them in
 my schoolbag.  If my shoes are dirty I
 clean them the night before.  I go and
 brush my hair and get my coat and put 
 it on.  Stewart is usually ready by   
 that time to go to school.            
 When school is over I go home and get 
 changed into old clothes, and then do 
 my homework and go out to play.  When 
 it comes 6.00 p m our tea is usually  
 ready.  After tea is over I watch T.V.
 for half an hour then I go out to     
 again.  At 7.30 p m I get washed and  
 change.  I watch T,V. until 9.30 p m  
 and then I go to bed.                 </content>
