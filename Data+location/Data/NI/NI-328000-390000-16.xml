		<title>16LIFE IN BALLYCLARE</title>
		<content>    Life  in Ballyclare  is becoming  a
 little  bit  boring  because there  is
 hardly   anything   to  do . There  is
 nothing for the children to do because
 there  are  no {amusements }except for
 the  Mayfair which comes  once a year.
 The park at the bottom of the town has
 been  knocked  down  and  there are no
{Leisure  Centres} in  Ballyclare.  The
 nearest are the  ones  in  Antrim  and
 Rathcoole.                            
                                       
    Life in Ballyclare is awful because
 a  lot  of  shops are broken into,cars
 are  stolen ,houses at the back of the
 shops  are being knocked  down and new
 ones  are  put in  place. I don't like
 living  in  Ballyclare  because  there
 isn't much fun for children.
