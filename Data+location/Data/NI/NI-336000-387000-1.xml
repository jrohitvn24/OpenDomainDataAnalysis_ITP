		<title>01SUMMARY OF CARRICKFERGUS.</title>
		<content> The name Carrickfergus is derived from
 the legendary figure of Fergus, who   
 was either a King of Scotland or an   
 Irish chieftain around 320B.C.  Once  
 the capital of Ulster, it is situated 
 10miles along the Belfast Lough shore 
 and has a strikingly beautiful        
 hinterland of farmland, forest and    
 reservoirs. In the early l95O's its   
 growth developed with the man_made    
 fibre industry but with the closure of
 I.C.I.and Courtaulds in l98l more     
 attention has swung to the development
 of the harbour area.  The Courtaulds  
 factory has become an Industrial      
 Estate covering a wide range of       
 individual small firms.  Our survey   
 area stretches West from the Woodburn 
 river (which means MAD River) and     
 follows its course south to the old   
 Courtaulds complex on the Lough shore.
 The western boundary is Knockagh.     </content>
