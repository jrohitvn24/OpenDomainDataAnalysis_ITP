		<content> In recent years the beautiful mill    
 pond has been filled in and as a      
 result swans are no longer seen       
 swimming majestically in the centre of
 the town. Local people protested but  
 nothing could be done to prevent this 
 happening. The head race running at   
 the back of Mill St and Dunbarton St  
 was also filled in and as a result    
 access was made easier to the back of 
 shops in the streets and break-ins are
 commonplace. It is hoped that pathways
 will be built in this area and opened 
 to the general public. The site of the
 Open-Air Swimming Pool convenient to  
 Dunbarton Bungalows has long since    
 closed and used to dump old cars and  
 other rubbish. building permission has
 just been granted for the erection of 
 houses here.
