		<content> The trunk road from Dublin to Derry   
 passes through the northern part.     
  The eastern part of the region is    
 drained by the River Blackwater while 
 the water from the north-western      
 corner flows into a tributary of the  
 River Strule.                         
  The townlands of Garvaghey and       
 Rarogan are in Omagh District Council.
 The rest of the area belongs to       
 Dungannon District. Similarly the     
 region is divided between the Western 
 and Southern Education Boards.        
  Most of the area is part of the      
 Parish of Errigal Ciaran except for   
 the south-western corner which belongs
 to the Parish of Clogher.
