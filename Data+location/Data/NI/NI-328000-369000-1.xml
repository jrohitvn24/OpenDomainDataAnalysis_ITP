		<content>    The block lies in the South-West   
 corner of Greater Belfast and contains
 the districts of Finaghy, Ladybrook,  
 Andersonstown, Taughmonagh, Suffolk   
 and Twinbrook. Part of the western    
 edge of the block lies outside        
 Belfast City Boundary forming part of 
 Lisburn Borough Council. A section of 
 the M1 Motorway(which runs from       
 Belfast to Dungannon) passes through  
 the centre of the block which also    
 contains part of the Belfast to Dublin
 Railway line.                         
   The two best-known buildings are    
 probably 'The Musgrave Park Hospital  
 Complex' and 'The King's Hall at      
 Balmoral' which is the venue for the  
 largest Agricultural shows; the annual
 Ideal Home Exhibition; important      
 boxing matches etc.(some of Barry     
 Mc Guigan's recent world title fights 
 took place there.)                    </content>
