		<title>04MAY DAY AND THE MAYPOLE/2</title>
		<content> This story was found to be impossible 
 as Raven's map of Holywood points out.
  It dates from about 1625 and shows a 
 Maypole structure in the exact spot   
 where those sailors are said to have  
 erected their mast in the 1700's.  A  
 much more likely story says that Early
 English settlers in Holywood much used
 to Maypole traditions in their        
 homeland, quickly made a Maypole in   
 their new homeland and it has for     
 centuries been an important feature of
 life in Holywood.  Many people come to
 Holywood to see this genuine          
 attraction today.                     
                                       
 May Day just would not be the         
 same without the Maypole.  It catches 
 everyone's eye, as dancing routines   
 are performed around it.  On special  
 occasions like May Day the Maypole is 
 decorated with ribbons and flowers.   </content>
