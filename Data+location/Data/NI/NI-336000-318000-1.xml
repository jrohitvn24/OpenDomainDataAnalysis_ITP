		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> Ours is a rural area with mountains to
 the north and the sea on the          
 south.This results in a mainly farming
 and fishing community.                
 The farms are small and scattered     
 about the hillsides and people        
 connected with the fishing are centred
 around the fishing village of         
 Annalong.                             
 Nowadays Annalong is becoming more of 
 a satellite town with houses springing
 up and people travelling as far away  
 as Belfast to work because the fishing
 is in decline.                        
 There are few professional people,    
 except for teachers and a doctor. We  
 do not have bankers and lawyers and   
 only a few businessmen.               
 Its situation beside the sea attracts 
 quite a number of vivitors in the     
 summer, who stay mostly in caravans.
