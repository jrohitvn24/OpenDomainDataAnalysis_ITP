		<title>01THE LOCAL AREA</title>
		<content> Our area is situated on the southern  
 shore of {BELFAST LOUGH}about 16 km   
 east of Belfast.The area is mainly sea
 which includes a busy shipping lane   
 where ships of all sizes and          
 descriptions ply their way to and from
 Belfast docks.                        
   Most of the land in this block is   
 privately owned by two educational    
 establishments and one 18 hole golf   
 course.There are,however,three        
 residential areas:-                   
{ GLENCRAIG, SEAHILL}and{CRAIGAVAD     
 These areas are served by a single    
 church in Glencraig whose present     
 vicar is the Reverend Canon A.        
 Maconachie.It is a Church of Ireland  
 (Anglican) establishment so people of 
 other denominations have to travel    
 outside the area to their churches
