		<title>11How my Dad spends his Day</title>
		<content>{BB My dad follows the occupation of a 
{policeman.}When he is on night duty he
 goes to work at 11 p.m. Daddy doesn't 
 put his uniform on until he gets to   
 the station incase somebody attacks   
 him. My daddy says:                   
    "Several years ago after very      
 careful consideration I decided to    
 join the{Royal Ulster Constabulary.}My
 first posting was to the most westerly
 police station under the jurisdiction 
 of the British Government, being      
 Belleek in Co. Fermanagh. This of     
 course was after having spent six     
 months in training at the depot in    
 Enniskillen. Since then I have been   
 attached to several stations and      
 presently serve in Belfast.{What I    
{enjoy most is meeting the general     
{public and getting to know new place. 
 My regret is the good friends I have  
 lost through terrorist activity."     </content>
