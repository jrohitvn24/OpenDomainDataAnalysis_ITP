		<content> Our survey showed the following youth 
 uniformed organizations in the area:- 
 Boys'Brigade(5);Girls'Brigade(5);Girl 
 Guides(3);BoyScouts(2);Campaigners(2);
 Church Lads'Brigade.These are all     
 church based except 1 troop of scouts.
 Out of 275children(8-11yrs)in our     
 school,70% are members of uniformed   
 organizations.58% of 268 children     
 (12-18yrs)also belonged.              
 Most groups have summer or weekend    
 camps which are extremely popular. The
 annual display is also a favourite.   
 Nearly all the boys organizations have
 football teams which play on Saturday 
 mornings but none of them has a band. 
 The spiritual needs of the children   
 are catered for,either by Bible class 
 on Sunday,or through Bible study as   
 part of the week-night programme.
