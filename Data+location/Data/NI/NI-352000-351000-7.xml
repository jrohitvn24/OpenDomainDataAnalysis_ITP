		<title>07Seaboard Sailing Centre.</title>
		<content> One of Killyleagh's major advantages  
 is its position on Strangford Lough   
 for those interested in sailing. The  
 South Eastern Education and Library   
 Board realised this opportunity when  
 they established the Seaboard Sailing 
 centre to the south of the town.      
   Its aim is simply to teach people to
 sail. It caters not only for schools  
 and colleges within the Board's       
 jurisdiction but for people from all  
 over the world.                       
   They have several different types of
 craft, sailing dinghies such as       
 Witchcraft, Laser, Topper and G.P.14's
 and three cruisers.                   
    The centre is manned by six        
 permanent staff and can  cater for up 
 to forty people both sailing and      
 residential.
