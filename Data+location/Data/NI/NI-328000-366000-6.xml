 Saint Patrick's Parish Church and     
 grounds cover 3 acres.The present     
 Rector of the church is the Rev       
 Cooper.The organist is Michael        
 Richards.                             
 When the church was first recorded in 
 1306 it was a barn church.The present 
 day church was built in 1870 and is a 
 cruciform church.                     
 A tower has been added to the church  
 since then.It is 82 feet high.Inside  
 the tower there are 8 bells making one
 octave of music.Also there is one very
 old bell which was made in 1686.      
 There are 240 families in the         
 Parish.It costs Â£30,000 to run the    
 church for a year.The Lych gate was   
 erected in memory of John Ferguson in 
 1878.There are arches of yew trees in 
 the grounds which were planted in     
 1886.                                 </content>
