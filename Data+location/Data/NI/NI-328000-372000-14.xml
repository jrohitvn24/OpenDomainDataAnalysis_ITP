		<content>   Our area is not only divided between
 urban and rural zones but also between
 Catholic and Protestant zones.        
   Some areas of Belfast have been     
 traditionally dominated by one or     
 other of the{religious}groups but     
 since the start of the current        
{'troubles'}in 1969 such divisions have
 become more rigid. The majority of the
 population of our area is Catholic and
 is divided from the Protestant area by
 a so-called{'peace-line'.}In some     
 places this takes the form of a high  
 fence; in others it is represented by 
 the two sides of a main road while in 
 other places an area of derelict      
 housing marks the boundary between the
 two communities.                      
   Both sides tend to keep themselves  
 to themselves with religion being     
 closely tied to{Loyalism }(Protestant)
 and{Republicanism}(Catholic).         </content>
