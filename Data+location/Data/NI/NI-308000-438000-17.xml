		<content> The church on Ramoan Road was built   
 not only for those in the town but    
 also for people from the rural areas. 
                                       
 Although there has been a great deal  
 of religious hatred in Northern       
 Ireland, Ballycastle has to a large   
 degree been free from most of this.   
 The clergy and congregations from all 
 the major churches often come together
 for services and social gatherings.   
 When the local Catholic parish priest 
 celebrated his golden jubilee some of 
 the first to congratulate him were the
 local ministers.                      
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
