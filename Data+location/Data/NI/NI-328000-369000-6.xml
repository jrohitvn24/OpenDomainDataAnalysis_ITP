		<title>06    TRAFFIC SURVEY</title>
		<content> The area we studies had the M1        
 Motorway passing through it. This is  
 the busiest road system in Northern   
 Ireland. We carried out three traffic 
 surveys on our square. The first      
 involved counting the traffic flow to 
 and from Belfast in a ten minute      
 period. In our second study we did a  
 similar survey but divided the        
 vehicles into two categories,         
 commercial traffic and domestic       
 traffic. Our final study was simlar to
 first except that we counted the      
 vehicles on Finaghy Road North to     
 compare the traffic on a main road    
 with a motorway. All surveys were     
 carried out mid morning.
