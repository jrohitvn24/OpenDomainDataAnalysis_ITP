		<content> Facilities for the Arts are poor in   
 the Borough, but there are plans in   
 hand to build a new 'dry' leisure     
 complex at the bottom of Station Road.
 This will include a multi_purpose hall
 which should allow for the provision  
 of auditorium and proper stage        
 facilities.                           
 Larne Drama Circle has been battling  
 for years to persuade the local       
 council that such an amenity is       
 necessary.                            
 The Club is an excellent ambassador   
 for the town. This year its production
 of Christina Reid's play, 'Tea In a   
 China Cup' won the premier award in   
 the Amateur Theatre world, the Grand  
 Opera House Challenge Cup.            
 The opportunity of playing in the     
 Grand Opera House in Belfast is       
 granted to six companies who come top 
 in the Drama Festival Season.         </content>
