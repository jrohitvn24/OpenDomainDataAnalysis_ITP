		<title>01Hill Farms and Aughnacloy</title>
		<content> The farm land is hilly and difficult  
 to work with machinery. Fields tend   
 to be small and hedges are the main   
 fencing. Much of the low lying wet    
 land has been drained and improved but
 there is a lot of rough hill grazing. 
 Farm houses have been recently        
 renovated and have modern amenities.  
 In the last 10 years farmers have     
 purchased smaller neighbouring farms  
 to increase their acreage so here are 
 many unoccupied houses in good repair.
 Another sign of depopulation is the   
 disused Primary School in Grid 4.     
 In 5 and 9 a quarry provides local    
 employment, public transport is by    
 Ulsterbus between Belfast and         
 Enniskillen.                          
 Grid 11 has the runs of a 16th century
 church with a small cemetry which is  
 still used. It has recently been laid 
 out as an attractive 'Rest Area'      </content>
