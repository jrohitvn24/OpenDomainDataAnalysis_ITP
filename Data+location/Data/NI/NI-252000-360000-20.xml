		<content> Gaelic{football}is the most popular   
 game for the catholic people of this  
 area.Each GAA club is based in a      
{parish.}The Red knights club is based 
 in Beragh and has 6 different teams of
 15 players each under 12,under 14 ,   
 juvenile under 16,minor under 18,the  
 reerves and the seniors.The teams all 
 play in the Tyrone League.When men    
 reach their mid thirties they retire  
 from the game and just support it.The 
 ladies play camogie which is also a   
 GAA game and is played with a stick   
 and ball.{Handball}is also a popular  
 GAA game and there is a handball alley
 in Beragh.As the GAA seeks to promote 
 a gaelic Irish culture it has very    
 little support from the protest people
 who play soccer and rugby.Catholic    
 also play these games.The nearest     
 clubs for these games are in Omagh.
