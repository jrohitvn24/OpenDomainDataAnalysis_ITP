		<content>{RATHS}Maps of the area show numerous  
 raths or ancient Irish hill forts.    
 However they are very difficult to    
 find on the land and appear as no more
 than hummocks.                        
{HUNGRY HOUSE LANE}Runs N.E. from the  
 Glenavy Rd. There are two local       
 theories for this strange name        
 (1)During the Irish Famine(1840s) a   
 whole household died of hunger here.  
 (2) On this road was a house,where    
 food was distributed during the       
 Famine.                               
{HORSEPARK}Runs off Kilcorig Rd.It is  
 said to be so called as at one time a 
 troop of cavalry from a nearby castle 
 trained here.There is today a house   
 dating from the Ulster Plantation     
 years.It is a listed building and is  
 currently under renovation.(Some of   
 the outbuildings are in almost        
 original condition).                  </content>
