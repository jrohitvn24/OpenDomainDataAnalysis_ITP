		<title>03BALLYGAWLEY ROUNDABOUT</title>
		<content>    Ballygawley is sometimes called the
 Crossroads of Ulster.The roundabout is
 always very busy.We visited the       
 roundabout on May 31st 1985 to make a 
 traffic count.From 10.15am until      
 10.45am 320 vehicles approached the   
 roundabout.Of these 108 came from     
 Dungannon direction,89 from Augher    
 direction,83 from Omagh direction and 
 40 from Ballygawley.Of these,87 went  
 towards Dungannon,110 went towards    
 Augher,87 went towards Omagh and 36   
 went to Ballygawley.195 were cars,78  
 were lorries and 52 were vans.If      
 traffic continued to approach the     
 roundabout at this rate for a 12 hour 
 day period then 7,680 vehicles would  
 pass round the roundabout.If          
 Ballygawley by_pass and roundabout had
 not been built in 1960,then the       
 village would indeed,now be very      
 congested with through_traffic.       </content>
