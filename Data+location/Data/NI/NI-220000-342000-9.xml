		<content>     There are six churhes in the area 
 and three of these are built within   
 50 yards of each other.These are the  
 Roman Catholic,the Church of Ireland  
 and the Methodist.These are all built 
 on the island, to the west, and along 
 with the Presbyterian church,also on  
 the island to the east,they are over  
 100 years old.Off the island to the   
 west are another Church of Ireland and
 the Jehovah Witnesses.                
          In the town old religious    
{attitudes}are still strong and church 
 attendance is still fairly high.This  
 is probably the result of strong Roman
 Catholic beliefs and the Protestant   
 ethos of Sunday Observance.In the town
 there are more Catholics than         
 Protestants,and today there is some   
 ecumenical worship,but it is very     
 limited.
