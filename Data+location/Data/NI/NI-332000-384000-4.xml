 built Community School in Northern    
 Ireland.

{should be a caring community,which    
{demonstrates its concern for all      
{pupils". }                            
  All pupils are afforded a broad      
 balanced curriculum so that in terms  
 of further education,training or      
 employment,they have as wide a choice 
 as possible.Pupils are educated to    
 G.C.E.O-level standard.               
  Throughout the curriculum,and in     
 other ways,strong links are forged    
 with the community.In 1984 the school 
 received the{Schools Curriculum Award

 throughout the United Kingdom.
