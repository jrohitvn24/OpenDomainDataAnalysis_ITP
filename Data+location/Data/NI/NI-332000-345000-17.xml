		<title>17The community in Guiness.</title>
		<content> This area is a close-knit country     
 community.The inhabitants of the      
 block,although not living in close    
 proximity to each other,generally feel
 a strong bond of friendship and       
 loyalty to each other.This is not     
 always apparent to an onlooker,but in 
 times of trouble or distress the      
 residents become like one big family. 
  This spirit of kinship probably dates
 back to penal times when the local    
 people joined forces together against 
 the ruling government.Or it may be an 
 essential part of farm life to depend 
 on ones neighbours in times of need.  
 Whatever the case it is clear that the
 people in this area form a community  
 more like an extended family unit,    
 rather than a number of seperate units
 which are forced together solely      
 because of locational factors.
