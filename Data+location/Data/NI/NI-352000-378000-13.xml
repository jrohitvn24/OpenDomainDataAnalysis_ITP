		<content> BALLYGRAINEY CHURCH HAS OVER 250      
 PEOPLE THAT ATTEND SERVICES.THE       
 MINISTER IS REV. WATSON HE HAS QUITE A
 FEW VISITORS AT THE MANSE TO ASK ABOUT
 THE CHURCH AND THERE ARE JUST FRIENDS 
 WHO COME ROUND TO SE HIM. HE FIRST WAS
 A MINISTER IN 1958 BUT BEFORE THAT HE 
 WAS  A PART TIME MINISTER. MR WATSON  
 SEES HIMSELF AS JUST AN ORDINARY      
 PERSON WHO TRIES TO TEECH OTHER PEOPLE
 ABOUGHT GOD AND RELIGION AND NOT ABOVE
 ANYONE ELSE. A MAN CALLED McALLISTER  
 WAS THE FIRST PREACHER IN BALLYGRAINEY
 CHURCH.NO-BODY IS ABLE TO TELL IF     
 THERE WAS A CHURCH THERE BEFORE.HE    
 LIKES BEING A MINISTER BUT AT TIMES IT
 IS HARD WORK ESPECIALLY TAKING TO     
 CHILDREN.HE VISITS OTHER CHURCHES     
 OFTEN TO PREACH.HE BEEN A MINISTER FOR
 27 YEARS.MR WATSON USED TO HAVE BEES  
 AS A HOBBY BUT THEY DIED.
