		<title>01GENERAL INFORMATION</title>
		<content>{Ballycastle},the administrative centre
 of{Moyle District}is situated on the  
 North Antrim coast within sight of    
 Scotland. It is a small town of around
 5,000 people. The area to the south   
 and west is mainly farmland, but the  
 land is not intensively farmed; its   
 main use being silage and rough       
 grazing.                              
 Behind the town lies the hill called {
{Knocklayd}(514m) the lower slopes of  
 which are covered with coniferous     
 forest.                               
 There is little in the way of local   
 industry apart from a small shirt and 
 garment factory. As a result many     
 local people have to travel out of the
 town to find work. In the Moyle       
 District the rate of unemployment is  
 around 24% _ much higher than many    
 other areas in Northern Ireland.
