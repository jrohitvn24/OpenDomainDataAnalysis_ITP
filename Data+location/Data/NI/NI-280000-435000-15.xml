		<content> A chiropodist lives next door to me on
 a farm. You might think she looks     
 after cows and sheep but in fact she  
 looks after hands and feet.           
  You need a lot of training to be one.
 This lady trained for two years and   
 she learnt all about the bones of the 
 body.                                 
  She needs a lot of materials such as 
 cotton wool,nail snippers,scissors,a  
 file,a probe,a scalple and dressings. 
 When a patient comes with an ingrown  
 toe-nail she gets some instruments and
 takes off each layer of skin until    
 eventually she gets it out. She also  
 treats corns and athletes foot. Her   
 job sometimes takes her away from home
 if anyone is ill and cannot get to the
 surgery at her house. She has been    
 doing this job for twenty-five years.
