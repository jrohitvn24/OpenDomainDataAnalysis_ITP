		<content> In Donemana about 90% of the land is  
 used for grazing and silage.Silage is 
 a crop of grass which is cut in June  
 or July and put into a pit which is   
 sealed with plastic, and is used to   
 feed cattle in winter.The remaining   
 10% contains a few acres of barley    
 which in most cases is undersown with 
 grass,and is also used for cattle     
 food.The few acres of  potatoes are   
 grown for homeuse.There are also many 
 hedgerows which serve to seperate the 
 fields.Along routes of streams and    
 rivers, trees and bushes are very     
 obvious.There are also some well      
 established deciduous trees such as   
 ash, sycamore, and beech,around many  
 of the older farmyards.Clumps of      
 coniferous trees such as spruce and   
 pine appear here and there in land    
 which  is of poor value.
