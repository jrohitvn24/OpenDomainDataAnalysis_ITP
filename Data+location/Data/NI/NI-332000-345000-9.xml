		<content> This is an area of moderate summer    
 weather,but extreme winter conditions.
 Being a semi-mountainous region,it is 
 prone to heavy rainfall in autumn,and 
 severe snow in winter.                
  Climatic conditions are even seen to 
 change in short distances within the  
 block.This is specially noticable with
 snow.The further west one travels one 
 begins to climb into the foot of the  
 mountains.This is marked by a sharp   
 increse in snow cover,varying from    
 around 4-5cm.in the lower east,to     
 10-12cm.when one reaches the highest  
 points in the north-west.             
  It is also surprising to outsiders   
 how quickly the area can decome       
 snowbound.This can happen within the  
 space of only an hour or so.This can  
 be difficult for people working       
 outside the area and run the risk of  
 getting snowed out.                   </content>
