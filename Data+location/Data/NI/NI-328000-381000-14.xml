		<content> area close to the Glenwell Road near  
 M2. An old bridge is still in         
 existence at the end of Farmley Car   
 Park, supposed to be used by troops on
 their way to the Battle of Antrim     
 (1798). The area was boggy  and the   
 land was generally fairly bad and was 
 made up by small farms which took     
 their produce to market in Belfast.   
 Most of the main building began 50    
 years ago when roads and trams began  
 to develop.                           
   Glengormley became the outer        
 junction for the trams and gave people
 much more flexability as to where they
 lived in respect of their work. The   
 majority of employment was still in   
 Belfast and it was not until the      
 improvement of the road systems in the
 60's and government influence that new
 employment was located in this area,  
 thus increasing development further.  </content>
