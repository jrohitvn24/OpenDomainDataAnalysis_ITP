		<title>18Leisure Time,    Randalstown</title>
		<content> Being a rural community there are no  
 facilities at all for group activities
 or individual pastimes,ie.there are no
 leisure centres,youth clubs,community 
 centres, etc.  Hobbies and leisure    
 activities are therefore based around 
 the home.                             
 The children of the area cannot play  
 'football in the street',but of course
 they do have much better open spaces  
 in which to play games. However since 
 they live so far apart team games are 
 rare.  Most country kids drive old    
 cars,motorbikes or tractors around the
 farmland and make good use of the     
 fields for games like 'hide_n_seek'and
 racing their BMX bikes.               
 Many take part in Young Farmers Club  
 activities such as ploughing,cattle or
 sheep showing and craft competitions. 
 This experience all comes in useful   
 when help is needed around the farm.  </content>
