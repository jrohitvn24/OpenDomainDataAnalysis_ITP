 Fermanagh Wood Products Ltd.,is a     
 factory which began production in     
 1976.When it first began,the workers  
 produced dowelling pins which were    
 sold chiefly to local furniture       
 manafacturers.These dowels were made  
 mostly from beech which is grown in   
 Ireland.                              
         Later on, when the management 
 decided to diversify and manafacture  
 handles for tools,other timbers were  
 used.For striking tools hickory from  
 North America, and parmarfin from     
 South America,were found to be        
 suitable because the closeness of the 
 grain makes them hard and durable.    
 Ash,grown in Ireland,is used for      
 bending tools like shovels and spades.
                                   The 
 factory covers an area of just over   
 300 square metres.                    </content>
