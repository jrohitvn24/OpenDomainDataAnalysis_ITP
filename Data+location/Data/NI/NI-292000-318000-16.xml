		<title>16Cures in Cullyhanna.</title>
		<content> Many of the old superstitious cures   
 are still applied in the area,        
 although cures for serious afflictions
 are not so popular, but still         
 respected even if not practised.In the
 cure for the stye in the eye, nine    
 gooseberry thorns are used.Ten were   
 plucked,one thrown away over the      
 shoulder by the sufferer,and the      
 person who was making the cure then   
 jabbed each thorn in succession at the
 stye after he had said some prayers in
 Irish.Anyone could make the cure,     
 providing one's parents were alive.   
 Whooping _ cough could be cured by    
 several methods,the most popular one  
 in the area being, for the patient to 
 receive "three charities"i.e.food from
 a woman who had not changed her maiden
 name after marriage.The food took the 
 form of,bread and butter and jam,a    
 sweet,a biscuit,an apple,etc.         </content>
