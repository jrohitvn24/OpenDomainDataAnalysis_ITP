		<title>17MINTERBURN SCHOOL</title>
		<content> We have many school traditions; the   
 classes take turns, providing a       
 morning assembly,we have a concert    
 each Christmas term,each June we have 
 a sports day,and at the end of June   
 the children who are leaving this     
 school entertain us.One year the      
 teachers decided to entertain! We have
 an active parents teachers            
 association.This year the comittee    
 organised a fashion show and a sale,  
 which raised enough money to finance a
 new reading scheme. Last year we had a
 school trip to Edinburgh, which was   
 enjoyed by all participating.This year
 we had hoped to journey to London, but
 we could not raise a sufficient       
 number.We are going to have a picnic  
 in Tannaghmore Gardens instead!       
 We hope the school at Minterburn will 
 continue for many years.
