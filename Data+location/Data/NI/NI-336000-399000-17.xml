		<title>17AN ICE HOUSE</title>
		<content> In a field beside the old Castle gates
 is a curious old doorway, leading into
 a dark tunnel. The floor is muddy and 
 it has an abandoned  appearance. One  
 might think that it was an air-raid   
 shelter from the Second War. It is an 
 ice house belonging to{Kilwaughter    
{Castle,}which is in Lealies. It is an 
 arched tunnel with a dry well at the  
 back.The arch is about two metres high
 and one metre wide. The well is lower 
 into the ground, being one metre wide,
 and three metres deep. The ice house  
 itself, is now covered in moss and    
 grass. Cattle shelter in it. You would
 know that it is old, because it is    
 built of basalt. A hundred years ago  
 they would have put the meat in the   
 well for cold storage. Then when they 
 wanted the meat, they would send two  
 people down into the well to attach   
 the pullies and bring  up the meat.   </content>
