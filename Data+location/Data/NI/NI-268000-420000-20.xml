		<title>20MINI RUGBY</title>
		<content> I attend Limavady Central Primary     
 School where we play Mini Rugby.  This
 is a game like men's rugby except that
 no kicking is allowed and the only way
 to score is by a "try", when the ball 
 is set down behind the other team's   
 line.  There are seven players in     
 each team, three of which are forwards
 and the rest are backs.  If the ball  
 goes out of play, all six forwards    
 form a scrum, the ball being put in by
 a scrum half.  Forward passing is not 
 allowed.  If it happens a free throw  
 is given to the other team.  Our team 
 have won the Mini Rugby Trophy for the
 second year.  They are Nicky, Ryan,   
 Crighton, Nigel, Trevor, Christopher  
 and myself. The sub is Stewart. Mini  
 Rugby is great. It makes you fit. You 
 are in the open air.  You travel to   
 different places and you make good    
 friends. WRITTEN BY RICHARD (Captain) </content>
