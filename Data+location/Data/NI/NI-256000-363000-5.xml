		<title>05SAND AND GRAVEL QUARRYING</title>
		<content> By 1960 tractor machinery was 'rising'
 sand and gravel, which was being      
 washed and graded by automatic washing
 plant,and used on site for concrete   
 block making; and supplying to the    
 building trade which was just now     
 flourishing because of Government Aid.
    {In the past 25 years, millions of 
{tons of FALLAGHERIN earth have been   
{transported to thousands of building  
{sites in Monaghan, Fermanagh and South
{Tyrone in the form of sand, gravel,   
{building blocks and concrete.}Two     
 other firms have moved in, purchased  
 land to literally move it southwards. 
 The Green Hills are disappearing; huge
 ugly brown caverns and large muddy    
 settling ponds take their place; the  
 bog roads sag beneath 30 ton trucks;  
 the rivers are polluted at source, but
 we have work and people have houses of
 top quality Fallagherin sand'n gravel.</content>
