		<title>06A DERG FARMER'S DAY. 1.</title>
		<content>     Seven a.m. marks the start of     
 another day for the farmer. A day     
 different tothe previous one, as there
 is no knowing of what the day is going
 to unfold."Weather conditions",       
 livestock health and crop conditions  
 all dictate what has to be done.Never 
 the less a basic pattern emerges.     
     Milking of the dairy herd starts  
 off the day.The cows are brought in   
 from their "one day paddocks" to be   
 milked.By 9.a.m. the cows have been   
 milked ,the milking plant             
 sterilised,the cows have been given a 
 "new" paddock with fresh grass and the
 milk is ready for collection.For the  
 next two hours I will feed the rest of
 the livestock and check that they are 
 all in good health.                   
      the rest of the day is spent     
 doing various jobs about the farm.
