		<title>07CHURCH RUINS AND GRAVEYARD</title>
		<content> Beside Carrick Lake we find the ruins 
 of Carrick Lake Chapel and graveyard, 
 dating from around the 1400's.A modern
 writer tells us that it measured 60ft 
 by 18ft inside.Only parts of the two  
 gables remain.It seems to have been a 
 private Chapel of the ruling family,  
 before the Ulster Plantation.It may   
 have existed as a place of worship for
 the local Catholic people until penal 
 times.                                
       Since then the Church has fallen
 into ruin but the graveyard itself is 
 badly kept and the tombstones are     
 difficult to read.Some appear to be   
 buried.The oldest inscriptions on the 
 headstones, which are standing, date  
 back to 1742.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
