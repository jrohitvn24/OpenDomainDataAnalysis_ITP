		<title>07OLD CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH</title>
		<content> The Old Congregational Presbyterian   
 Church in Randalstown, was built in   
 1790.  The land on which the new      
 church was to be built was given by   
 Rose O'Neill.  The new church cost    
 Â£600.00 to build.                     
                                       
 The O.C. is a very unusual shape :_   
 oval.  Only two other churches of this
 shape exist.  One of these is in      
 Edinburgh, and the other is in the    
 bottom of a reservoir in Wales.       
                                       
 The first stone was laid on the{12th  
{July, 1790. }The church was built from
 the stones from Ballymena Castle which
 was being demolished at that time. In 
 1829 the roof of the church was raised
 to accomodate a gallery, at which     
 stage the oval windows were added.    
 These have rotted and need replacing  
 at a cost of Â£10,000 pounds.          </content>
