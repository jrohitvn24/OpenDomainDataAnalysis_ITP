   The Parish Carnival is held each    
year in June. It is a very enjoyable   
day for all the family.                
   Stalls are set up by different      
groups in the community. There are     
shops set up in tents and teas are     
served in the larger tents.            
   Novelty races are held for all ages.
These include egg and spoon, three     
legged, wheelbarrow and relay races.   
   One event which creates great fun is
"Duck The Mermaid". A man sits on a bar
which is connected to a target. When   
the target is hit the man falls into   
a barrel of freezing water.            
   The climax is the naming of the     
"Mayor Of The Roe". A number of local  
people have stood for this position:   
the winner being the one who raised the
most sponsorship money.
