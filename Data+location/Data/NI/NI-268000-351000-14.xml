		<title>14Farm buildings</title>
		<content>   The farm which my class went to see 
 was Mr Elliot's.  It is a modern farm.
{The cattle house holds up to 150      
{cattle. }It is divided into six       
 sections, three down each side.  The  
 roof has ventilators to let the hot   
 air out.  This keeps it from getting  
 too hot in the shed.   Another house  
 on the farm is the{pig house which has
 small walls built to divide it into   
 pens for sows and their piglets.      
{It is dark and stuffy in the pig      
{house.                                
   Another building is the{meal house  
{which is automatically controlled so  
{that when Mr Elliot presses a button a
{measured amount of meal comes down a  
{chute.  He can then take the meal to  
{the required animal.                  
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
