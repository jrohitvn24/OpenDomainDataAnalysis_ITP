		<title>18CLIFTONVILLE GOLF CLUB</title>
		<content> The original golf club was founded in 
 the early 19th century.  The          
 club-house was on the Oldpark Road,   
 and to get to the course golfers had  
 to go through Price's farm on the     
 Ballysillan Road.                     
   In 1924 the club-house was moved to 
 Westland Road and a new 18-hole course
 was built beside it on open fields.   
 The movement was founded by 21 members
 of the Council, but some years after  
 this Sir William Neil, one of the     
 councillors bought 9 holes off the    
 club and turned it into the Joanmount 
 Estate, named after his daughter.     
   The chub has won many cups in its   
 history.  In the 1930's it won the    
 Ulster Cup and every year it plays a  
 club from Cork for the Little Island  
 Cup
