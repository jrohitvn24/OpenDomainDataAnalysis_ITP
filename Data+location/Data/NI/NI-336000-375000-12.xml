		<content> VISIT THE ALLOTMENTS AND BUY WHAT THEY
 REQUIRE.                              
   FOR THE PAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS THE  
 PLOTS HAVE BEEN OWNED BY THE PARKS AND
 CEMETERIES SECTION OF BELFAST CITY    
 COUNCIL.THE RECENT BUILDING OF THE    
 OUTER RING ROAD HAS BROUGHT VANDALISM 
 TO THE PLOTS AS A LARGE PROTECTIVE    
 HEDGE WAS REMOVED FROM THE BOUNDARY   
 AND REPLACED BY A SMALL FENCE.THE     
 NUMBER OF ALLOTMENTS WAS REDUCED      
 BECAUSE OF THE NEW ROAD,AND SOME      
 PEOPLE HAVE ALSO GIVEN UP THEIR PLOTS 
 BECAUSE OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE       
 FREEZER.THE NEED FOR FRESH VEGETABLES 
 IS NOT SO GREAT WHEN FROZEN FOODS CAN 
 BE BOUGHT EASILY.
