		<title>17COUNCIL CONCERNS _ LARNE</title>
		<content>{Tommy Robinson,a councillor on Larne  
{Borough Council}for 8 years,was{mayor 
{in 1983 and is mayor again}this year. 
 We asked him what problems the people 
 of the Coast Road area would bring to 
 him.                                  
{Litter}was the greatest concern.People
 are always throwing away all sorts of 
 things. They even dump grass cuttings 
 on the shore, though the binmen will  
 collect these if asked. A lot of the  
{rates go on clearing up litter.       
{Seaweed,}washed up on Ballygally beach
 by storms,{has to be cleared.         
 People often bring{planning problems  
 to Mr Robinson,if they are building.  
 This is a{tourist area}so the Council 
 don't allow buildings which spoil the 
 scenery. Sometimes people complain    
 about things which don't concern the  
 Council,the greatest being the state  
 of{roads,the responsibility of D.O.E. </content>
