		<content> As this is primarily an agricultural  
 area most of the housing is scattered 
 farmhouses and there is little recent 
 large scale housing development.  Most
 of the recent development is single   
 dwellings.                            
 There are some exceptions to this     
 pattern - fronting the Hillhall Road  
 where the farms are smaller there is  
 an area of ribbon development.  In the
 north east there is an area of large  
 exclusive homes for the wealthier     
 Belfast commuter.  On the western     
 border there are the fringes of two   
 modern Housing Executive estates which
 were built about 12 years ago mainly  
 to re-house people leaving the        
 troubled areas of Belfast.            
 In the soth west corner there is quite
 a large area of older private housing 
 called the Plantation.
