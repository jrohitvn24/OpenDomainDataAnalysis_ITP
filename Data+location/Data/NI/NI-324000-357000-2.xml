 Forty years ago{Hillsborough}looked   
 like a sleepy little village which    
 time had passed by. Virtually every   
 building was as it had been since the 
 time of{Wills Hill}who master-minded  
 the{Georgian architecture}in the 18th.
 century. Apart from maybe an          
 alteration here or there in           
 shop-fronts and a very few later      
 additions everything was just as it   
 had been for two centuries.           
    At that time most of the           
 inhabitants were{"Hillsborough        
{people,"}some the descendants of the  
 people of earlier times and           
 comparatively few of them without some
 sort of family roots going back at    
 least two generations. There was a    
 great sense of "belong" and everyone  
 knew everyone else.
