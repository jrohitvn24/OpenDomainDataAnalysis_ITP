		<title>05THE BREAD BASKET</title>
		<content> The bread basket is a cafe and a cake 
 shop,on the main street.Geoffery's mum
 is one of the assistants.She sells    
 bread,cakes and crisps at the         
 counter.I have only been in the bread 
 basket a few times but I like it      
 because it sells all my favourite food
 and drinks and smells of freshly baked
 bread and cakes.The bread basket is   
 medium sized. There are four chairs   
 to each of the eight tables.The owners
 names are Pat and Cecil Duncan.The    
 prices are quite cheap and they bake  
 all their own food and cakes.My mum   
 likes it because it sells tea,coffee  
 and little snacks.The bread basket    
 owners have built their own bakery at 
 the back in February 1985 and that is 
 where they make all their own bread.  
 They now employ a new baker especially
 to make their cakes.
