		<content>   The houses had thick stone walls and
 small windows and the floors were     
 earthen. Only the rich people had     
 carpet,and oil lamps were used to give
 them light.People had to do their     
 washing by hand and they had irons    
 which were heated in the fire.They had
 no electrical appliances so they did  
 most of their cooking on a pot.       
   Houses are built with concrete      
 bricks now and they are insulated and 
 some houses have very large           
 windows.Washing machines are tumbler  
 dryers are of great convenience and   
 electricity.Cooking is done on        
 electric or gas cookers.              
   All the work had to be done by hand 
 and there was no machinery to help    
 them.Now there is a lot of machinery  
 and work is done a lot quicker than   
 before.It is all a lot easier.
