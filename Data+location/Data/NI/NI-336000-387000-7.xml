		<content> The best time to catch Brown Trout and
 Rainbow Trout is near dusk, when the  
 wind has dropped down to a ripple.    
 Put a dry fly on and use a small      
 colourless float.  If the float       
 disappears below the water you have a 
 fish on.   You strike and hope that   
 you have hooked it.  Should the clutch
 start to scream you have a big fish   
 on, if it doesn't its just under a    
 pound.  The biggest fish I've caught  
 was a 2 pounder and it was caught on a
 bubble float with a worm.  Some       
 good flies to use are Coachman, Zulu  
 Warrior, Goldy Lure, Black Zulu, Peter
 Ross, Greenwell's Glory and Silver    
 Doctor.  I have seen up to one hundred
 fishermen round the dams.  A Junior   
 permit costs Â£3.45 and an adult's     
 costs Â£24.
