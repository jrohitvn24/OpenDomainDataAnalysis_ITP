		<content> Part of the Mourne Wall is in this    
 block. This is a 6 ft high wall of    
 dressed granite blocks, built without 
 mortar which was constructed to       
 delineate the Belfast and District    
 Water Commissioners land. It follows  
 the line of the watershed and goes    
 over all the main peaks with a small  
 tower to mark the approximate summit  
 of each mountain. It was originally   
 built to prevent trespass but has     
 never succeeded in this. Most of the  
 Wall still stands but in places it has
 been broken. This damage is due to a  
 variety of causes but one disturbing  
 recent development has been the       
 introduction of small scrambler motor 
 bikes which use the mountains as a    
 race track. In order to move their    
 bikes from one side of the Wall to the
 other, riders simply demolish the     
 Wall. The bikes also break the ground.</content>
