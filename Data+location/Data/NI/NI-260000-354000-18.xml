		<title>18THE BALLYGAWLEY RIVER</title>
		<content> The Ballygawley river named as the    
 "Ballgawlley Water" on the map is a   
 small, winding stream, rarely reached 
 more than twenty metres in width.     
    Years ago the main purpose was to  
 drive the various mills such as the   
 flax mill at Lisdoart, which is now   
 closed down.                          
    Today the river is mainly used for 
 fishing and has a quite good stock of 
 brown trout. Around this area there   
 are a lot of keen trout anglers, and  
 the main place to fish is the         
 "Ballygawley Waterfall" where a lot of
 trout have been caught.               
    Most of the trout are around the   
 half pound bracket but some trout     
 weigh up to two pounds. Worms are the 
 most popular bait, although flies and 
 spinners are also used. The           
 Ballygawley river flows into the River
 Blackwater.                           </content>
