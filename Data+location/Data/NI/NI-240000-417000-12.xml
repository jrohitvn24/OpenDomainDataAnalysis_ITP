		<title>12FARMING CHANGING LAND USE</title>
		<content> Along most of the western part of the 
 block there is farmland although this 
 is under great pressure from the needs
 of the city as more housing is needed 
 to cope with the ever-increasing      
 population of the city and its        
 suburbs.The population of the city is 
 now estimated at around 92,000,making 
 it the fourth largest city in Ireland.
    Most of the farming which is       
 carried out is dairy farming or       
 raising cattle and sheep for          
 meat.Recently the abbatoir and        
 livestock market moved from the city  
 out to the eastern suburbs, where it  
 is nearer to the large farms.         
    Some cereal crops such as corn,    
 barley,oats, potatoes,cabbage,turnips 
 and some carrots are grown to supply  
 local needs.All in all it seems as if 
 farming in this block will soon be a  
 piece of history.                     </content>
