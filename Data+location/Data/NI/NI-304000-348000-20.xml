		<content> Because of cutting silage in the early
 spring, the corncrake and the cuckoo  
 has totally disappeared from the area.
 A giant hogweed (Heracleum            
 Mantegazzianum) is causing concern to 
 environmentalists in the area. This   
 weed was introduced as a garden       
 ornamental from the Caucasus in the   
 late 19th century. It has spread along
 the River Bann and along the roads of 
 the area. It grows to a height of 3-4 
 metres. Its leaves are 1 metre or more
 wide. Copius quantities of sap are    
 released if a stem or leaf is broken. 
 This irritates the skin causing mild  
 rash or watery blisters and severe    
 cases need hospital treatment. Efforts
 are being made to have it declared an 
 "injurious weed" under the Weeds Act  
 of 1959.
