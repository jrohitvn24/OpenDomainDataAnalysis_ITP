		<content>The village of Trillick provides a     
limited selection of the goods required
by the people of this area.            
                                       
Some of the shops do not open until a  
little later in the morning and remain 
open until the late evening, i.e. from 
10a.m. until 9p.m. It is common for    
housewives to shop on Saturdays in     
Omagh, the county town, 17 miles away. 
This is a convenient way to shop as    
these women travel to these larger     
shops in their own cars. In addition   
to shopping on a larger scale, Omagh   
is the centre for other services, such 
as banking, shopping for clothes and   
recreations.                           
                                       
The main road to Omagh passes through  
the town of Dromore.
