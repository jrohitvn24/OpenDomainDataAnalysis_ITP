 About half of this section  beyond the
 town boundary of Larne is agricultural
 land.  Most of the farms are small and
 are run by the  farmer and his family.
 The  average size is around{ 70 acres.
                                       
 One the higher land{ sheep}are  grazed
 while on the lower pastures some{dairy
{herds}are kept. Both are sold in local
 markets  like the  weekly one  held in
 Ballyclare.The  milk is  processed and
 cheese made in a dairy at{Ballynure.  
                                       
{Barley  and  oats}are  grown  together
 with some potatoes. Some small farmers
 have a  second  occupation and much of
 the work  particularly  looking  after
 the{ chickens}is the work of the wife.
