		<title>14Owning a small shop</title>
		<content> Owning a small shop is hard work in   
 Belfast. Your day just doesnt start at
 9.ooam and end at 5.00pm like with an 
 ordinary worker as there are always   
 books to be taken home and kept       
 up-tp-date. My father is a butcher    
 and,especially working with food he   
 has to be extra particular about      
 hygiene. To start out on your own     
 business you would first consult your 
 bank manager who would want to know   
 the amount of money involved and      
 decide whether or not to lend you the 
 money. Supermarkets today have the    
 power to buy in bulk and sell the     
 goods at a price the small shopkeepers
 cannot compete with. In Ireland in the
 past ten years 11,000 small shops have
 had to close owing to the rise in the 
 number of supermarkets opening.
