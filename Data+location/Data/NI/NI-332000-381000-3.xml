		<content>      I think{Rathcoole Estate}is a    
 pretty reasonable place to live. Our  
 house is a terrace house with three   
 bedrooms, a living room, a sitting    
 room, a kitchen and a bathroom. Most  
 of the houses are like mine though    
 there are flats and tower blocks as   
 well.                                 
      The estate is quite tidy but some
 parts are rundown and dirty and       
 covered in graffiti. The worst part is
 round the old Alpha cinema which was  
 burned down before I can remember.    
      The young people have not very   
 much to do in the estate. There is a  
 Youth Club but it is boring.There     
 aren't any parks or discos but at     
 least there is the{Valley Leisure     
{Centre}for young and old to go to.    
      I hope I get a job when I leave  
 school so I don't have to hang about  
 like some people do.                  </content>
