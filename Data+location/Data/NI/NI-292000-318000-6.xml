		<title>06Cullyhanna Confirmation (2)</title>
		<content> The Rite comprises of a number of     
 parts which help us to understand the 
 meaning of the sacrament.Confirmation 
 is administered during Mass.It begins 
 with an address from the Bishop,      
 followed by the Renewal of Baptismal  
 Promises.Then comes the Laying on of  
 Hands,an ancient gesture which        
 signifies the gift of an invisible    
 power given to us from on high.After  
 this comes the Anointing with Chrism, 
 (made from olive oil &amp; balsam.)This   
 signifies that one is now a special   
 member of the Kingdom of God. Each    
 child goes to the altar with a sponsor
 who places the right hand on the e    
 child's shoulder. The child's         
 Confirmation name is given to the     
 Bishop who dips his thumb into the    
 chrism and makes the sign of the cross
 on the child's forehead,saying"N..Be  
 sealed by the Gift of the Holy Spirit"</content>
