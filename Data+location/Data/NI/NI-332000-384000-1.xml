  This area can be divided into two    
 main parts.Approximately one third    
 of the area is residental and the     
 other two thirds is farmland.         
  The housing estates are on the lower 
 slopes of the Knockagh and Carnmoney  
 Hills,and form part of the borough of 
 Newtownabbey.There is a mixture of    
 rented and privately owned housing,   
 with residents travelling to work in  
 nearby industrial estates and in      
 Belfast.These housing developments are
 fairly modern.                        
  The other two thirds of the area is  
 the upper slopes of the Knockagh.The  
 land is mainly rough grazing and is   
 dotted with small hill farms and      
 occasional private dwelling.Livestock 
 (cattle and sheep)are reared and there
 is little arable farming.             </content>
