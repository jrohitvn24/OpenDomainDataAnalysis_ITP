		<content> There are two churches in the block,  
 one being Roman Catholic and the other
 Presbyterian.                         
  St.Colman's Roman Catholic church was
 originally built on donated land in   
 1934,but has been modernized several  
 times since.The block falls within the
 parish of Magheradroll and Dromara.   
  St.Colman's church in Dunmore serves 
 a congregation of obout three hundred 
 people.Mass is celebrated in the      
 church on Sundays and Friday evenings.
  Magherahamlet Presbyterian church    
 caters for a congregation also of     
 about three hundred,but most of that  
 number come from outside the block.   
 It is a small building located on the 
 eastern edge of the block.            
  The majority of the population of the
 block are Roman Catholic,and therefore
 attend St.Colman's church.
