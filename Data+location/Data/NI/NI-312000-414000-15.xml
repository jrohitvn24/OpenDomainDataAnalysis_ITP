		<title>15BY THE FIRE</title>
		<content> When I was coming home from dancing on
 Saturday it was{wet and misty. }As I  
 came closer to the house I looked in  
 the window I saw the{rosy red fire.   
  I sat down on the sofa between Mammy 
 and Daddy. They asked me how I got on 
 at dancing? I said I got on very well.
 Mammy told me to take my beans and    
 toast. I brought them over to the sofa
  The saucer was sitting on the fire it
 nearly roasted me. I felt it,{warm and
{cosy,}as I put the bowl on my cold    
 legs. It warmed my legs that I thought
 I had never been out at all. {The red 
{and orange sparks were lovely.        
 Bernadette and Mairead were  playing a
 school with some dolls and teddys from
 the bedroom.  Daddy read a book and   
 Mammy was knitting so I took a        
 library book and began to read.  I    
 soon forgot I was out that night in   
 the wind and rain.                    </content>
