		<title>09LAGAN CANAL AT NEWPORT</title>
		<content>{Newport}owes not only its name but    
 its very existance to the Lagan Canal,
 which was built in stages from 1753   
 and which was closed in 1954.There are
 still many signs of the canal,which   
 was controlled by the Lagan Navigation
 Company and joined Belfast to Lough   
 Neagh.Newport became a very busy quay 
 and great quantities of grain and coal
 were unloaded for the nearby Newport  
 Distillery.                           
 Industralisation and building         
 development in the 1970's altered the 
 Newport-Culcavey area substantially.  
 The Finn family now live at 9 Hart    
 Terrace,a row of modern terraced      
 houses.This was originally Puddledock 
 Row where canal navvies lived.They    
 were men who dug out clay and mixed it
 with water to make a watertight lining
 for the canal.
