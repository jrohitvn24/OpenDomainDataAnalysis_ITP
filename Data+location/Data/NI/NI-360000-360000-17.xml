		<title>17LOCAL HISTORY  (part 1)</title>
		<content>       Amongst the English families who
 settled in the Ards, as early as the  
 12th. century, were the Savages, who  
 were of Anglo-Norman descent. They    
 established themselves as the dominant
 local family (N.B. Glastry House)     
 until Shane and Hugh O'Neill, the     
 Earls of Tyrone drove them down to the
 extreme south of the Peninsula where  
 they erected various strongholds      
 during the 17th. century. e.g. Quintin
 Newcastle, &amp; Kirkiston Castles. In a  
 manuscript dated 1405 Robin, son of   
 William Savage, is named as one of    
 John De Courcy's hostages - one of    
 many documentary sources from King    
 John's reign. Roland Savage was "Lord 
 of the Little Ards" during the middle 
 of the 16th. century.                 
  From the early years of King James   
 1's reign, came Scottish &amp; English    
 settlers in search of land &amp; wealth.  </content>
