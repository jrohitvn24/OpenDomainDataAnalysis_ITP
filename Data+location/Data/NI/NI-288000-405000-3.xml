 QUARTER TO SEVEN                      
  I GOT MY CLOTHES ON, WENT TO         
 THE TOILET, WASHED  MY HANDS AND FACE 
 AND WENT DOWN AND GOT MY BREAKFAST I  
 GO OUT AND PLAY FOOTBALL WITH GORDON  
 AND THE DOG TILL A QUARTER PAST EIGHT.
 I GO IN AND GET MY SCHOOL BAG AND GO  
 UP TO THE END OF THE LANE. THE BUS    
 COMES AT AROUND 8:32. SOME MEN TAKE MY
 MONEY AND SOME DO NOT. IN SCHOOL IF WE
 ARE GOOD WE GET DOING ART AT 1:30.
