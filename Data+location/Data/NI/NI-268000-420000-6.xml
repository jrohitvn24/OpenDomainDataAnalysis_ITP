		<content> Whitehill is a private housing estate 
 situated in the north-west of our     
 study region.  At the entrance there  
 are 2 very big houses and smaller ones
 further down the estate.  Some houses 
 are detached and the rest are         
 semi-detached which all have windows  
 in the roofs called skylights or attic
 windows.  Whitehill is a very modern  
 housing estate and the first phase is 
 about 4 to 5 years old.  Most of the  
 houses are completed and being lived  
 in, but there are still some wich are 
 being built at the moment.  Its       
 nickname is "Cornflake Hill" because  
 it is said that when the people have  
 paid their mortgage they have not     
 enough money to buy food, so they live
 on cornflakes.  Before Whitehill was  
 built the land was used for farming.
