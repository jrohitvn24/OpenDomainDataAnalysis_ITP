		<content> A large{motorway}called the M.2.runs  
 through our area linking Belfast to   
 the N.W. of the Province.It carries   
 large numbers of cars,lorries and vans
 each day.This is mostly{through       
{traffic}.                             
 There is a well developed road network
 around the town of Antrim and even    
 the{minor roads}are well tarred and   
 easy to drive on.                     
 Road networks in the housing estates  
 have been well laid out.The streets   
 are wide and have few sharp bends.    
 Most households have a{car}which can  
 be kept in a garage or small parking  
 lot.                                  
{Bus services}are very regular from the
 estates to the centre of town.The     
 countryside is little served and      
 people there depend on their own car. 
 Young people use{cycles}or{scooters.}
