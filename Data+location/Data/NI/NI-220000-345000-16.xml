 but forty years ago it was bought from
 the farmers and changed into an Old

 two buildings but now because of a new
 covered walkway the buildings now join
 to each other.The Home can accomodate

 families and only receive visits from 
 friends.The Home employs 26 people    
 including a part time handi man.
