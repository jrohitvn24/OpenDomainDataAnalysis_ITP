 or fairly new and more are being built
 every day.  There are many individual 
 farm houses and new houses in the     
 farming part of our area.             
   The built up area of Glengormley is 
 bordered by the M2 to the south and   
 the Ballyhenry Road to the west       
 although  new houses are being built  
 along the western side of the         
 Ballyhenry Road.  These are mainly

 Â£45 000.  No play areas are planned.  
   Other areas of development are on
