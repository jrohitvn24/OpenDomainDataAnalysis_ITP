 litter louts. Doors and windows of old
 houses are being broken and kicked in.
 Several attempts of kidnapping have   
 occurred in Gilford district. Schools 
 have been broken into and things      
 stolen. There is one police car to    
 cover the whole area. There are twelve
 in the district police force. Signs   
 have been put up to stop people       
 throwing litter around. There has been
 very little response from people for  
 they are still throwing litter around.

 fine anyone throwing litter on the    
 ground. The average crimes in a month 
 are four. There have been boys under  
 15 years of age drinking and glue     
 sniffing. The lost property average is
