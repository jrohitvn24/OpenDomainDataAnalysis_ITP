		<title>09BUILDINGS IN NEWRY.</title>
		<content> In 1824 St.Mary's chapel had, after 35
 years, become too small for the       
 Catholics of Newry.In 1825 the "Newry 
 Telegraph"  wrote of"the large numbers
 of people kneeling outside for want of
 room inside." A piece of low lying    
 marshy ground called Seymours Green   
 was bought by the bishop for the new  
 Cathedral.In 1811 the British         
 government made a law ordering        
 all people to pay a tax to support the
 building of St.Mary's protestant      
 church.A newspaper wrote that the     
 Catholics would agree to pay the tax  
 if the protestants would agree to help
 them pay for their Cathedral.The      
 foundation stone for the Cathedral was
 laid in 1825 and building finished in 
 1829, before the Act of Emancipation. 
 A new chapter house was added in 1985.
