		<content> The block consists of two river       
 valleys on either side of a ridge,    
 Slievenaman, which rises to 323 m. The
 rivers are the Shimna which flows     
 North-eastwards through squares       
 10,11,7 and 8; and the Muddock River  
 meandering roughly Northwards through 
 squares 9,5 and 1. The area consists  
 of drumlins of glacial till and the   
 thin-soiled shale ridge of            
 Slievenaman. The drumlins are fairly  
 intensively farmed although the       
 inter-drumlin hollows are poorly      
 drained. The farming is small scale,  
 mainly sheep on rough hill land and a 
 few beef cattle in the valleys. Many  
 farmers are part-time. There is no    
 industrial development nor any        
 village. It is a predominantly rural  
 area bordering the Mourne Mountains.
