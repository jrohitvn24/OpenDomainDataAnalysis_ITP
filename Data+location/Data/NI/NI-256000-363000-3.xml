		<title>03THE BUILDING TRADE</title>
		<content> Our survey shows that many men are    
 engaged in the building trade parttime
 or fulltime as selfemployed, or as    
 small contractors employing 1 or 2    
 skilled or semiskilled workers.       
   In recent years,with generous       
 grants,most owner-occupied houses have
 been renovated,extended or rebuilt.   
 New houses have replaced old,and some 
 with local connections have moved in  
 and built houses. As well there are   
 ongoing extensions to farm property.  
 Much of this work has been done by the
 owners. This experience has resulted  
 in many of these skilled tradesmen    
 being in demand in the surrounding    
 areas and towns.                      
   Young men naturally find it         
 relatively easy to being 'taken on' in
 this or related work.{This contributes
{to full employment in the area and    
{hopes for a secure,satisfying future. </content>
