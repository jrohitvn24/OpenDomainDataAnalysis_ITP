		<title>13RECREATION IN COALISLAND  3</title>
		<content>      The ladies prefer BINGO or INDOOR
 BOWLING and a number of local clubs   
 exist. BINGO is run two nights a week 
 locally but other areas have it on    
 alternate nights, so if you so wished 
 you could play it seven nights a week.
 Some women and men play WHIST in the  
 nearby town of Coalisland.            
      COCK-FIGHTING even though illegal
 has a strong following in the area.   
 Many local people provide WALKS or    
 RUNS for the fowl during the year and 
 then they are all brought together to 
 one particular house when they are    
 caged for two weeks and FOUGHT        
 somewhere on the Irish Border during  
 the months of June and July. A lot of 
 money is gambled on the outcome of    
 each battle.                          
      Traditional music is strong in   
 the area.
