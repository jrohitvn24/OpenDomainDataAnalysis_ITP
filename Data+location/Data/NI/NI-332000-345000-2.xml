		<title>02Farming in Guiness:General</title>
		<content> Farming is the most important         
 occupation in the block.Mixed farming 
 is carried out on the lower ground,and
 sheep are raised on the higher land.  
  The average size of farm is 7-8      
 hectares, though the lower lying farms
 are more intensively managed and are  
 thus more financially viable.         
 A variety of crops are grown,including
 fodder crops for the livestock.       
  Most cattle farmers breed beef       
 stock,though one keeps a dairy herd.  
 Cattle are marketed at the nearby     
 towns of Downpatrick and Saintfield,  
 while the sheep farmers go to sales in
 Saintfield or Hilltown.               
 The majority of the farmers suppliment
 their income with othe jobs,          
 particularly sheep farmers.In the     
 whole block there are only about six  
 full-time farmers.
