		<title>19THE QUARRY,GARAGE &amp; CHURCH</title>
		<content>{ The quarry}is one of the many in the 
 Roughfort area.The basalt which has   
 been excavated from the quarry was    
 used to surface roads.Basalt is the   
 most common rock in the area.         
  Extracted minerals have been used to 
 make sea walls in Co.Antrim.The Boyd  
 family who own quarries actually have 
 a connection with our school,as some  
 of the children were former pupils. { 
{ The garage}has been offering its many
 services for around 25 years.It sells 
 petrol,tyres and oil,as many garages  
 do.It also services cars and sells    
 confectionery.                        
  {Lylehill Pres. Church}has a minister
 called{Robert McMaster}.He lives      
 in the manse beside the church (80    
 Lylehill Road)which has been been     
 serving the community for many years.
