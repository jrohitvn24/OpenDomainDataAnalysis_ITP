		<content> After TV and sport the people         
 questioned spent their spare time in a
 number of ways.  Listening to the     
 radio, in a pub, painting, gardening, 
 reading books and writing letters were
 all popular.  It was a surprise to    
 find 9 poets and 12 short-story       
 writers in the sample of 55.  It was  
 an even bigger surprise to find 7 men 
 who sewed! (Only 8 women did.)  The   
 least favourite hobby was pottery with
 1, and only 3 people going to bingo.  
 Only 18% of the sample went to either 
 theatre or cinema.                    
    Those questioned spent most of     
 their spare-time watching something-  
 either TV or sports.  They don't seem 
 to go out very much, and when they do 
 it's to a local club or pub.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
