		<title>02FARMING-A TYPICAL FARMYARD</title>
		<content> Most farm buildings in this block are 
 built around an{open-sided rectangle. 
 The buildings consist of the farmhouse
 itself, barns, stables, byres, milk-  
 house and stores. You can see the     
 history of the farm in the buildings  
 because when the farmer built a new   
 home, he sited it beside the old one  
 which he left standing to use as an   
 outhouse. Therefore one will often    
 find a small cottage built of the     
 local{"black stone",}standing beside a
 larger two-storey house of the same   
 material, no longer used as a home,   
 and finally a modern bungalow.        
 Traditionally all the buildings were  
 white-washed which made them water-   
 proof as well as brightening them.    
 This was usually done in spring. Old  
 farmhouses often have many layers of  
 whitewash. Most old farms had their   
 own kiln,to burn the local{limestone. </content>
