		<title>08The paper-boy</title>
		<content> The paper-boy delivers newspapers to  
 people in their houses or places of   
 work. Newspapers are magazines        
 containing news. These usually come   
 out daily or sometimes weekly. The    
 paper-boy carries these in a bag. He  
 puts the papers through the letter-box
 which is a slit in a door. The owner  
 of the house collects the paper by    
 pulling the paper through the slit.   
 When the paper-boy gets back to the   
 newsagents he leaves his bag. He is   
 usually paid at the end of the week.  
 The newspapers are printed in a       
 factory and sent out to the           
 newsagent's shops daily. The          
 shopowners then give the papers to the
 paper-boy who delivers them on foot or
 by bicycle.
