		<title>19THE HEALTH CENTRE</title>
		<content> The Health Centre is situated at the  
 junction of Ballygudden Road and Main 
 Street and was built in 1972. Doctor  
 White and Dr. Hetherington have their 
 surgeries there with three nurses to  
 look after the treatment room. There  
 are three receptionists (one full-time
 and two part_time). The Centre is open
 during the week from 8.30am to 6.00pm 
 and on Saturday from 9-11am.          
 There is only one doctor on call on   
 Wednesday and Thursday. Generally they
 see 60 patients each day and have to  
 write about 80 prescriptions daily but
 they are at their busiest during the  
 winter months. The most common case   
 they deal with is the treatment of    
 verrucae. They have also had a few    
 emergencies from the local building   
 sites.
