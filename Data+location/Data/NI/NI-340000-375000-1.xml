 Our area lies South-east of the city  
 of Belfast, on the Holywood Hills,with
 views to the North across Belfast     
 Lough, to the town of Carrickfergus   
 with its historic Norman castle.      
 Looking southerly we see Strangford   
 Lough and Scrabo Tower perched on the 
 remains of an extinct volcano and     
 beyond,on a clear day, can be seen the
 Mourne Mountains etched against the   
 skyline.                              
 Although so close to Belfast the main 
 area is comprised of farmland with the
 grazing of cattle being the chief     
 occupation.The cattle are mainly dairy
 herds providing milk for the city and 
 surrounding countryside.It appears to 
 be a fairly prosperous area with many 
 new farm houses,but fields are not    
 large and most retain their original  
 hedge boundaries.                     </content>
