		<content> May 1985 and elections for local      
 government have just taken place.     
 Larne Borough Council controls an area
 stretching from Garron Point in the   
 North to Ballycarry in the South.     
 Twenty four thousand people live in   
 the District area.                    
 The Council office is in Victoria     
 Road, and the premises are called The 
 Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Buildings   
 after the Dixon family who were       
 benefactors of the town. The family   
 lived at Cairndhu, and their home was 
 given to the Hospital Authority to be 
 used as a convalescent home. After her
 death, Lady Dixon left much of her    
 estate to the town, and at the minute 
 it is being developed with the help of
 E.E.C. money. A caravan site and a    
 maze are in the process of            
 construction.
