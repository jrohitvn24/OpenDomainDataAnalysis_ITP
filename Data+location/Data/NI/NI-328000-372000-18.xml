		<title>18    The Army Presence</title>
		<content> Northern Ireland is unique among      
 European nations in the manner of     
 maintaining{'law and order'.}This     
 involves not only the regular police  
 force but the active presence of the  
 British{Army.}                        
   Our area has the heaviest army      
 presence in N.I.. Not only is the     
 army based in the local{police}       
 stations but three heavily fortified  
{forts}have been built from which the  
 army operate. These are manned by the 
 various regiments doing their tour of 
 duty. The sight of army landrovers    
 patrolling, heavily armed squads on   
 foot patrol, road blocks, individuals 
 being questioned and searched, houses 
 being searched etc are all accepted as
 a way of life. We, who are completing 
 the Domesday Survey, have never known 
 a time when it wasn't like this and   
 wonder if we ever will.               </content>
