		<title>06CHICKEN FARMS</title>
		<content> Within our area, there a number of    
 chicken farms. The farms usually      
 consist of about three or four large  
 houses.                               
    The houses can hold as much as     
 eight thousand birds each. The birds  
 arrive when they are only a few days  
 old and leave when they are about     
 eight weeks old. Water and meal is fed
 to them automatically.                
    The bird houses are heated by gas  
 and they are given fresh air by fans. 
 The temperature in the houses could be
 kept up to eighty degrees farenheit.  
 The birds grow very quickly in        
 conditions like these.                
    When the birds are fully grown,    
 they are taken back to the company    
 from which they come. The company then
 cleans them to be sold to large shops 
 and restaurants.
