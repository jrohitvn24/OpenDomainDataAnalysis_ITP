		<content>  Oxford Island became a peninsula in  
 1846, when the water level in Lough   
 Neagh was lowered.                    
  It is a nature reserve,where         
 everything is done to encourage plant 
 and animal life in their natural      
 environment.                          
  On Oxford Island there are some      
 picnic and play areas, positioned so  
 as to disturb the area as little as   
 possible.                             
  At the tip of the Island is Lough    
 Neagh Sailing Club.Also on the Island 
 is Waterside House,where groups can go
 to study the area.                    
  The Island is easily accessible by   
 road,and close to the M.I. Roundabout.
  There is an Imformation Centre on the
 Island which houses a small museum of 
 animal life in the area.Here groups   
 can book guides to lead tours through 
 the island.                           </content>
