		<content> There have been many changes in the   
 town over the last twenty years.The   
 Housing Executive have built many new 
 housing estates and this has resulted 
 in a rapid growth of population.Many  
 country people have moved into the    
 town.                                 
 There is a new Leisure Centre being   
 built and this will be a great asset  
 to the young people.It is a pity there
 is no swimming pool in it .           
 There used to be two hotels in the    
 area;one was destroyed in a fire and  
 the other was blown up.Sean McHugh is 
 building a new hotel.
