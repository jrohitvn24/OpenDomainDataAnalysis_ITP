		<title>02THE VILLAGE OF SCARVA</title>
		<content> Scarva has won the award of the best  
 kept village for three consecutive    
 years.  The man who has helped us to  
 keep our village tidy is Mr. P. Ross. 
 The park is kept very tidy by Mr. B.  
 Newell.  He feeds the swans with the  
 left overs of our school dinners.  He 
 also keeps the grass very neat and    
 tidy.                                 
 There are swings, a slide, and        
 climbing frames, which are most       
 enjoyable to play on.                 
 Many families come to the park for the
 afternoon, as they can eat their lunch
 at the picnia tables.scarva is a very 
 agreeable village to live in, as      
 everyone is friendly.  I love Scarva ,
 even though it is a small village.
