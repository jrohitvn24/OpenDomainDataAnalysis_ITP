		<title>01Lowland Plain of Maghera</title>
		<content> The area is slightly undulating       
 descending to a flat plain formed     
 from a reclaimed lagoon. The main     
 activity is agriculture with much of  
 the land used as pasture the fertile  
 soils also facilitate a nursery. The  
 small village of Maghera is mainly    
 residential but there are other       
 isolated dwellings throughout the area
 notably along the road network. Of    
 historical value there is the Old     
 Church and Round Tower in Maghera and 
 and Slidderyford Dolmen near Dundrum  
 Bay. The bay itself provides ideal    
 conditions for various types of birds 
 and is noted for many swans.          
 Recreational facilites are provided by
 a riding centre, a football pitch and 
 there is a small park overlooking     
 Dundrum Bay.
