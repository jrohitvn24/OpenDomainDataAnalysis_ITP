 In March 1985 a bomb went off in a    
 police barricks near our school. The  
 I.R.A put the bomb under a car. It was
 a cold night. A young policeman was   
 about to go home. His back window was 
 frozen up so he kept the door open so 
 he could see where he was reversing.  
 When he turned the key and the bomb   
 went off.He was blown out through     
 the open door. If the door had been   
 closed he would have died.This could  
 have been avoided if the policeman had
 gone according to the rules and taken 
 ten minutes to check his car before he
 got in.
