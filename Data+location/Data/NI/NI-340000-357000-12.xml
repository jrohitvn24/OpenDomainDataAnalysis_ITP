		<title>12CHANGES(2) SAINTFIELD</title>
		<content>   The old chapel at the bottom of Main
 Street is now used as a hall,and a    
 beautiful new church has been built   
 on the Crossgar Road.                 
                                       
   The Academy Primary school has been 
 moved from Fairview into a larger new 
 building on Listooder Road to         
 accomodate the children who now travel
 into Saintfield by school bus instead 
 of going to their little country      
 schools which have been closed.       
                                       
   In 1953 the new miracle-television- 
 had just been introduced with small   
 black and white pictures to view the  
 Queen's coronation.What a change      
 today-with large colour televisions   
 and video recorders so common.        
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
