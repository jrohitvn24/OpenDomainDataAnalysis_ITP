		<content>    The Railway and Kilroot Halt       
     The single track line which passes
 through the area runs from Belfast to 
 Whitehead and Larne.                  
     Kilroot Halt, which has been      
 closed now for some ten years, served 
 the immediate community for many years
 as a concessionary halt. Beside the   
 station a level crossing gave access  
 to Rosganna Manor, a large Victorian  
 Mansion, which was demolished in the  
 1970's to make way for Kilroot Power  
 Station.                              
     The line, opened in the 1920's as 
 the L.M.S. to facilitate tourists to  
 Whitehead, Blackhead, The Gobbins,    
 Browns Bay, Portmuck and Larne has    
 changed its name through the U.T.A. to
 "Northern Ireland Railways" is now    
 mainly a commuter line for people     
 living in Whitehead and Carrickfergus 
 and working in Belfast.               </content>
