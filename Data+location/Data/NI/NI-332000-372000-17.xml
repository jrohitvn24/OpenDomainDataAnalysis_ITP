		<title>17WHERE I LIVE.</title>
		<content>   I live in a part of Belfast called  
 Sandy Row. It is one of Belfast's re- 
 development areas. Some new houses    
 have been built, more are being built.
 All the old houses which are about one
 hundred years old are being knocked   
 down to allow for the redevelopment.  
   One of the new buildings already    
 being used is The Sheltered Dwellings.
 Old people live here. They have their 
 own flats and look after themselves   
 under the watchful eye of a warden.   
   There is also a Day Care Centre     
 where they can go and make things like
 baskets,toys and mats.                
   We now have a Community Centre where
 there are many activities for young   
 people. For example,a disco every     
 Wednesday. Old people can have their  
 dinner here also on a Wednesday.
