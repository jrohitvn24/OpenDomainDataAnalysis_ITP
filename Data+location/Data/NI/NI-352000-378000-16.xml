		<title>16 Home Life Jacqui's Mum</title>
		<content> On Saturday morning my mum's home life
 involves getting up and dressed and   
 then she makes breakfast for Amanda   
 and me. After she has made the beds   
 and tidied up, she takes us shopping  
 to Woolco in Newtownards. She does the
 weekly shopping and then we look round
 all the shops. Then my dad picks us up
 in the car and takes us up to Kiltonga
 Squash Club where they run a          
 restaurant. Mum helps with the meals  
 and then she sells drinks and crisps. 
 Sometimes if it is not very busy she  
 plays a game of squash with Amanda and
 me. In the evening when we come home  
 she watches television. She likes to  
 watch "Dynasty". Then she listens to  
 our Sunday School Lessons before we go
 to bed. Sometimes she likes to read a 
 book and then she goes to bed.        
                                       
                                       </content>
