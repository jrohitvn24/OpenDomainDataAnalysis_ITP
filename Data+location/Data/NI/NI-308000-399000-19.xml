		<title>19Around Camphill</title>
		<content> Camphill is an ancient settlement and 
 the remains of an old fort can be     
 found to the rear of our school.Today 
 many people live and work in the      
 area.The main sewage processing plant 
 for the whole of Ballymena lies       
 approximately one kilometre from the  
 school. A new cemetery has recently   
 been consecrated in our neighbourhood 
 for the use of the whole community.The
 area has many churches and schools    
 which supply the needs of the         
 people.A state children's home is     
 situated close by,and provides a home 
 for between twenty and thirty         
 children,who are less fortunate than  
 ourselves.These children can live in  
 the home for peiods of time ranging   
 from a few weeks to a number of       
 years.Some of the children soon       
 return to their own homes and others  
 are looked after by foster parents.   </content>
