		<title>16GLENGORMLEY IMPRESSIONS</title>
		<content>   Glengormley is a bit boring and I   
 would like to see some changes like   
 more playareas, sports facilities,    
 places like Crawfordsburn Country Park
 where you could go for an outing and  
 cinemas because the nearest one is in 
 town, leisure centres and Adventure   
 Playgrounds.                          
   What I like about Glengormley is    
 that there is grassland areas and it  
 isn't very dirty. I don't want any    
 more houses because then there        
 wouldn't be anywhere to go. I would   
 like to see more smaller shops because
 the big shops are putting them out of 
 business. I would like to see more    
 places for older people as there are  
 no Old Peoples Homes. I would like    
 there to be more shops opening and    
 then there would be more jobs.        
                                       
                                       </content>
