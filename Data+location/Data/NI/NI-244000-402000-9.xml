		<content>             {A Survey                 
 Out of the 260 people we surveyed we  
 found that 58% of them were employed, 
 5% unemployed and 37% were either     
 housewives, disabled or retired.      
  Of the 58% employed we found that    
 20% worked in agriculture, another    
  20% worked in manufactuering and     
  construction and the remainder was in
 public services,professionals and     
 buissnes.                             
 We also found that 63% of the working 
 force went out of the area to         
 work,while a mere 37% worked          
 locally.Of those who leave the area a 
 considerable number are ladies who    
 work in garment manufacturing         
 factories in Plumbridge and Claudy.   
  Many of the men who work outside the 
 area work in Leckpatrick Co-op which  
 is a dairy  and a hardware store.
