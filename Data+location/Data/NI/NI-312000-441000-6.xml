		<content> THE HARBOUR IN BALLYCASTLE HAS, FOR   
 MANY YEARS CAUSED CONCERN AMONG       
 FISHERMEN AND INHABITANTS OF RATHLIN  
 ISLAND. NOT ONLY DID SAND ACCUMULATE  
 IN THE HARBOUR MAKING ENTRANCE TO THE 
 QUAY HAZARDOUS FOR ALL BUT THE        
 SMALLEST OF CRAFT, THE EXPOSURE TO    
 NORTHERLY WINDS MADE ENTRANCE         
 DANGEROUS IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE IN POOR   
 WEATHER.                              
 IN AN ATTEMPT TO OVERCOME THESE       
 PROBLEMS,PROMOTE BALLYCASTLE AS A     
 FISHING PORT AND PROVIDE FACILITIES   
 FOR RECREATIONAL BOATING A NEW PIER   
 WAS CONSTRUCTED. IN THE FORM OF A     
 BREAKWATER,WITH SLIPWAY AND QUAY      
 FACILITIES ,THE NEW JETTY IS SEEN AS  
 PHASE ONE OF A MUCH LARGER PROJECT.   
 MUCH OF THE MONEY HAS COME FROM E.E.C.
 GRANTS(1.8 MILLION POUNDS) THE        
 REMAINDER FROM COUNCIL RATES.
