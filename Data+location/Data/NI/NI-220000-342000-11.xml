		<title>11HOUSING IN ENNISKILLEN 1</title>
		<content>    Being an island town,Enniskillen   
 has always had a restricted area for  
 building.By 1900,the island was well  
 built up and had extended to the east 
 and the west via the two bridges,with 
 a population of 3000.Most of this was 
 residential,the main shopping area    
 being around the{Townhall.   }        
  Since 1945 great changes have taken  
 place.The town has grown,but the      
 island,from being residential is now  
 almost wholly"commercial".There is    
 little private housing left on the    
 island.Many people now live in houses 
 built since 1950 in public and private
 estates.Most private houses on the    
 island have been tossed or converted  
 to commercial use.Others have been    
 renovated, with government grants so  
 there is very little poor quality     
 housing left in the block.
