		<content> There was no church in Kilmore until  
 the{1790's}.The old church was the    
 first in Kilmore for the villagers to 
 go to.The maximun number of people    
 that could attend was{160}people.     
 The church was still not finished at  
 around the{1830's}.In{1831}lighting   
 was fitted for the evening service.   
 Money was scarce and the gates for the
 church were delayed until{1833}.In    
{1838}a store was fitted in the aisle  
 and pinnacles were put on the corners 
 of the bell tower.In{1865}a vestry    
 room was made with 2 chairs and a     
 table to furnish it.That cost Â£35 and 
 2 shillings.The church had box pews   
 and the first ever Sunday School in   
 Ulster.The church had to stop because 
 they had too many people attending.In 
 the summer of{1976}the church was     
 dismantled and is now re-erected at   
{CULTRA FOLK MUSEUM}.                  </content>
