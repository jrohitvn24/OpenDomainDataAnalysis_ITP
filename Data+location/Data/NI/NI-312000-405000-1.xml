		<title>01WHITE HALL</title>
		<content>   White Hall is the ancestral home of 
{Sir George White,v.c.}hero of         
{Ladysmith}.He was born in Portstewart 
 but his family eventually moved to    
 live in Broughshane.                  
   White Hall is charmingly situated,  
 nestling amidst glades of great       
 beauty.The woodland walks which once  
 meandered the fertile valley of the { 
{Braid}and the mountains of Skerry and 
 Slemish are now used mainly by cattle.
   The building itself is comfortable  
 and roomy and comprises no less than  
 thirty two rooms, two attics and one  
 cellar.It possesses no features of    
 arctitectural value, though {eagles}  
 flank each side of the roof.          
   In front of the house is the remains
 of what was once a beautiful pond,but 
 unfortunately the swans which once    
 lived there have completely           
 disappeared.                          </content>
