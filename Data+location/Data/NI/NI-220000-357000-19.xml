		<content> On Saturdays I help in{Lowtherstown   
{Co-op store}on the Main St. The shop  
 now owned by Mr Irwin sells{groceries,
{hardware and fancy goods.}At 08.30 the
 staff open the doors and collect the  
 bundles of{newspapers}which have been 
 delivered.Some stock e.g.shovels,mats,
 cabbages,buckets and balls are put on 
 display at the front door. Most of the
 early customers call to buy the daily 
 paper.During the morning women come to
 purchase their groceries and household
 goods and place them in a wire basket.
 At the cash desk the price of each is 
 entered into the register which gives 
 a receipt when the drawer is opened.As
 a{Mace}shop each week there are offers
 of some goods at bargain price which  
 go quickly.We are busy keeping the    
 shelves filled up and putting prices  
 on the tins,packets and bottles.The   
 shop closes at about 20.30.           </content>
