		<content> Our area is called Mourne which comes 
 from the Irish MOO RIN meaning a      
 mountain ridge. A corner called       
 Sawhill also comes from the Irish     
 Sawell meaning barn. Two roads of     
 interest are Majors Hill named after  
 a man nicknamed the Major and the     
 Grove Road, so called because it leads
 to a grove of trees.                  
    The main historical feature in our 
 area is the cornmill which dates backs
 to 1830.It houses a graindrying       
 kiln,three sets of mill stones and    
 ancillary machinery.It is powered by a
 water wheel which has now been        
 restored to fully working order.      
    The harbour of Annalong is         
 situated on the ford of the river.It  
 was built in 1758. Since then many    
 boats have been tied up in it. The    
 meaning of the word 'Annalong' is ford
 of ships, because of the Vikings.     </content>
