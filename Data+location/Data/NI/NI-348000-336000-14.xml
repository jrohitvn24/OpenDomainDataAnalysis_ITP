		<content> The area is steeped in history.       
 Ballynoe Stone Circle (Standing       
 Stones) is just outside the area. St./
 Patrick is reported to have visited   
 the area immediately after arriving   
 and converting Dichu at Saul (near    
 Downpatrick). He came to see an       
 important local chieftan called Ross  
 who had his fort on 'Bright Hill _ the
 top of Carrowbane mountain.           
 Bright/Carrowbane mountain was also   
 the site of a Norman tower house l2th 
 century, the ruins of which (one wall)
 still stand.                          
 Ballydargan mill is also              
 architecturally interesting and is    
 shown on a map dated l777. The ruins  
 of this mill still stand.             
 Oakley Manor (ruins) is in the centre 
 of a walled estate which dates back to
 the l4th century.
