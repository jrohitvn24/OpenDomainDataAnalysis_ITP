		<content> THE FIRST SCHOOL WAS A SINGLE-STOREY, 
 ONE-ROOMED BUILDING BESIDE THE CHURCH.
 THIS SITE,NOW BUILT OVER,WAS REPLACED 
 IN 1912 BY A LARGER STRUCTURE DESIGNED
 TO CATER FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE MILL 
 WORKERS AND LABOURERS.IN 1974 A MODERN
 SCHOOL WAS BUILT AND CONSISTS OF FOUR 
 CLASSROOMS,ASSEMBLY HALL AND KITCHEN. 
 ONLY A FEW FAMILIES WALK TO SCHOOL OR 
 ARE LEFT BY CAR. THE MAJORITY COME    
 FROM UPPER AND LOWER BURNDENNET,      
 BALLYMAGORRY AND AS FAR AS STRABANE.  
 THE SCHOOL HAS ABOUT 110 CHILDREN AND 
 IT HAS ITS OWN MINIBUS.THE TEACHING   
 STAFF CONSISTS OF FIVE TEACHERS BUT IN
 COMMON WITH MANY SMALL RURAL SCHOOLS  
 THERE IS THE DISTINCT THREAT OF SOME  
 STAFF BEING MADE REDUNDANT IN THE NOT 
 TOO DISTANT FUTURE.PUPILS REMAIN AT   
 THIS SCHOOL UNTIL THEY ARE ELEVEN     
 YEARS OF AGE AFTER WHICH THEY TRAVEL  
 TO SECONDARY SCHOOLS AT STRABANE.     </content>
