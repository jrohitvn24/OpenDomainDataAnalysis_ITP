		<title>05A RAMBLE ALONG LARNE RIVER</title>
		<content> Our class climbed down to the river   
 bank from Ballyrickard Bridge. It was 
 summer and dry, yet the ground was    
 marshy. Suddenly we surprised a curlew
 and its speckled nestling, the adult  
 running near us, dragging its wing.   
 Avoiding both, we followed the shallow
 stream through flat fields of grazing 
 cattle. After a kilometre, the river  
 was 3 metres wide, 20 cms deep and its
 flat fields had started to slope down 
 to it. After another kilometre, the   
 sides had become quite V-shaped and   
 steep, with natural thickets on the   
 right bank; and, on the left, a plant-
 ation of various trees, masking the   
 view but not the sound of traffic on  
 the dual-carriageway above. Finally,  
 the river deepened and widened, and we
 came to where water was drawn off for 
 cloth dyeing; and a fish-leap of easy 
 steps for trout and salmon to climb.  </content>
