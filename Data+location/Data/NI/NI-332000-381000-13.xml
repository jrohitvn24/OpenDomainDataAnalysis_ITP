		<content>          On Sunday morning I get up   
 late at 9.00 a.m. and have toast and  
 tea for breakfast. After this I get   
 changed and either watch television or
 play some games for a while.          
          I then get ready for Sunday  
 school which is brilliant fun. It     
 lasts for an hour, half an hour       
 singing and half an hour in classes   
 which is fun. Each year we go on an   
 outing.This year we are going to the  
 Lion Park. We also have parties and   
 get prizes for good attendance.       
          After Sunday School I go home
 for my dinner and then if there is a  
 good film on I watch it.              
          My daddy goes to the Kinghan 
 Church for the deaf and the bus comes 
 to collect him at 5.45. The Church    
 begins at 7.00 but it takes time      
 getting a seat as it fills so quickly.
          This is my Sunday life.      </content>
