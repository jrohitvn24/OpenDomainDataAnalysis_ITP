		<title>01Cullyhanna District.</title>
		<content> The area is typical of the Monaghan/  
 S.Armagh region,drumlins with little  
 natural woodland,devoted to rough     
 pasture.Marshes occupy much of the    
 land between hills.Mixed farming is   
 the occupation of the vast majority of
 the people.Farms average about 16     
 hectares,and are given over to raising
 of cattle.The area is poorly served as
 regards facilities of any kind.Roads  
 are poor and apart from school        
 services,public transport serves the  
 village of Cullyhanna only on         
 Thursdays and Saturdays.No recreation 
 exists in the area for young or       
 old,apart from a small wooden hut     
 which is used for activities organised
 by the local Community Association.A  
 new G.A.A.complex is under            
 construction.The people are 99%       
 Catholic served by one church and one 
 priest.It is a nationalist area.      </content>
