		<title>15EMPLOYMENT IN ARDBOE</title>
		<content> The fishing industry is the biggest   
 single employer in the Ardboe         
 area.Based on Lough Neagh the industry
 is run by a co-operative owned by the 
 fisher men themselves.However fishing 
 here is a seasonal occupation.The     
 season itself lasts some five months  
 from May to October,with the result   
 that many fisher men are unemployed   
 for the rest of the year.Most of these
 fishermen then claim some form of     
 benefit as other employment is hard to
 find.Some of them however ,who own    
 land ,fall back on their other basic  
 livlihood ,farming The dairy          
 industry is the major part but sheep, 
 pigs and other live stock are also    
 kept.Barley and potatoes are the      
 principal crops grown .Beside the     
 school here there is astud farm.We    
 can watch the young foals playing in  
 the fields beside their mothers..     </content>
