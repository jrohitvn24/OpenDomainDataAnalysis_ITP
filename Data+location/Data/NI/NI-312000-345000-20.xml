		<title>20SPORTS DAY,BANBRIDGE ACADEMY</title>
		<content>    Today is Thursday 24th June,1985.  
 It is the Annual School Sports Day at 
 Banbridge Academy.  The sun is shining
 and many pupils are sitting on the    
 grass watching their fellow pupils    
 taking part in various athletic       
 events.  There is great competition   
 between the school houses of Iveagh,  
 Bann, and Mourne and our new          
 headmaster Mr.Breen keeps everyone in 
 high spirits and encourages everyone  
 to do well.                           
    Today is also the day of the       
 Domesday Survey when groups of pupils 
 from Forms 2 and 3 are walking round  
 the surrounding area carrying out an  
 amenities count under the auspices of 
 some of their teachers.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
