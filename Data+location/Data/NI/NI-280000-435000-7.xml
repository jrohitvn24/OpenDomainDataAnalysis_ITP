		<title>07Employment in Portstewart</title>
		<content> Although unemployment in Northern     
 Ireland is high it is interesting to  
 note that of over 160 families        
 surveyed only 8 fathers and 5 mothers 
 were said to be unemployed-under 5%.  
 Of fathers the largest group (26)were 
 self-employed followed by security    
 forces(25),13 were teachers and 12    
 engineers,10 were sales               
 representatives and 8 university      
 lecturers and another 8 in the civil  
 service.                              
 Of the mothers 75 were said to be     
 housewives while 20 were              
 schoolteachers,11 secretaries,11 sales
 assistants 8 child minders and 7 self 
 employed.                             
   Taken as a whole the survey would   
 tend to indicate that Portstewart is a
 fairly high income area.
