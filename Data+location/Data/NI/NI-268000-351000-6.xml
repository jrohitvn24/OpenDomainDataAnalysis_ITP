		<content>   Some of the farmers in the area keep
{suckling herds.  Sucklers are calves  
{which have been suckling milk from    
{their mothers.                        
   They are not very tame as they are  
 used running wild taking milk from    
 their mothers in small portions.  This
 means that they do not take chills or 
 scours as easily.  These calves fatten
 quicker than bucket fed calves but    
 they may not grow as big.  Their      
 mothers need plenty of grass to       
 provide enough milk for the calves.   
   The best breeds of calves to buy for
 suckling are{Limousins, Simentals,    
{Charolais and Herefords. }Fresian     
 bullocks are not so easy to fatten as 
 other breeds as they are too tall and 
 are more for milk and are very "gutty"
 with big hanging stomachs.            
   If I was going to buy a suckling    
 herd I would buy Simmentals.          </content>
