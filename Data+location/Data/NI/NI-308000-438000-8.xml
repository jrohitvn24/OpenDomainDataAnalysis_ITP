		<content> The newspapers in our area are{The    
{Coleraine Chronicle}and{The Tribune}. 
 These are printed outside Ballycastle 
 but they are the only papers with our 
 local news.                           
 Recently a monthly magazine, "Moyle   
 Monthly" has been published which     
 consists of 4_6 pages of local events,
 but it has ceased publication.        
                                       
 The two main events this week are a   
 suspect bomb and a priest's{Golden    
{Jubilee.    }                         
 The bomb was suposed to be in a beer  
 keg in a car. This was found to be    
 empty.                                
 Also this week a  Roman-Catholic      
 Parish Priest celebrated {50 years}in 
 the priesthood.
