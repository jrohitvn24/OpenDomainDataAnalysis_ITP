		<title>15HOUSING. (part 1)</title>
		<content>  In a rural community there is little 
 pattern to settlement: farm houses are
 scattered at random through the       
 countryside, many situated up lanes   
 off the main roads. There are some    
 modern bungalows springing up but most
 of the houses are rented properties   
 owned by N.I.Housing Executive.       
 There is a collection of houses at    
 Rubane; these were built over 30 years
 ago, and some are much older. The most
 striking recent development of        
 Executive houses can be found in      
 Parsonage Road, Kircubbin. Within the 
 past five years a large housing estate
 has grown up. This is the only "built-
 up" area within this grid, so we      
 carried out a small survey. This      
 included Roden Street which is one of 
 the oldest streets in the village.
