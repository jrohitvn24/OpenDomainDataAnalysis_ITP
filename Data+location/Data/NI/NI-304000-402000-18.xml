		<title>18A FACTORY WORKER</title>
		<content>  Mr. Jim Bonnar has been working in   
 Gallahers for twenty_six years. He    
 lives on the Old Cullybackey Road,    
 Ballymena and travels to work by car, 
 a journey of approximately ten        
 minutes.                              
  Mr. Bonnar works a forty_six hour    
 week, but the standard is generally   
 thirty_six hours. He does not do shift
 work and has an average of five breaks
 per day. Mr. Bonnar's job is a        
 technical charge hand. He has not     
 always done this job, for his first   
 ten years he was a section mechanic.  
 Sometimes his work is difficult when  
 the machines become more complicated. 
 There is no other job in the factory  
 which he would like to do, he is quite
 happy where he is.                    
  He enjoys working in Gallahers       
 because of the good conditions and    
 pay.                                  </content>
