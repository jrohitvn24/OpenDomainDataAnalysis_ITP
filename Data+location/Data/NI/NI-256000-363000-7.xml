		<title>07TURF AS A FUEL</title>
		<content>    We have been using turf for a very 
 long time.About two years ago we had a
 new cooker installed to burn turf.The 
 turf in the cooker heats the{hot water
 for domestic purposes,provides{central
{heating}and the heat for{cooking meals
    About the end of May we employ a   
 man to cut turf for us on our bank.   
 When the turf have dried a bit we go  
 to the bog to turn them.Later they are
{footed}and then put in{rickles}or     
{clamps.}They are afterwards bagged for
 taking home. Then we employ another   
 man to bring them home by tractor and 
 trailer.{During this work most of the 
{family are involved.                  
    We burn turf in two open grated    
 fires as well. Apart from the work    
 involved,{peat is a powerful,clean    
{and economic fuel}providing us with   
 most of our energy needs. In this area
 we take the bog for granted.          </content>
