		<content> THE RIVER ERNE RISES IN COUNTY CAVAN. 
 IT FLOWS THROUGH FERMANAGH AND MEETS  
 THE SEA IN BALLYSHANNON.THE ERNE      
 BRINGS A LOT OF TOURISTS TO FERMANAGH 
 THE RIVER FORMS TWO LAKES, UPPER AND  
 LOWER LOUGH ERNE.IT WAS ONCE ONE      
 OF THE BEST SALMON FISHING RIVERS IN  
 EUROPE BUT CHANGES HAVE MADE THE      
 SALMON POPULATION LESS.A HYDROELECTRIC
 DAM WAS BUILT AT BALLYSHANNON, SALMON 
 DISEASE, POLLUTION CAUSED BY          
 AGRICULTURAL, INDUSTRIAL AND DOMESTIC 
 WASTES,AND A HUGE INCREASE IN THE     
 NUMBER OF COARSE FISH HAS LED TO      
 THE DECLINE. THE ERNE IS ABOUT 70     
 MILES LONG  THE ERNE IN BELLEEK IS    
 VERY DEEP BECAUSE OF DRAINAGE SCHEMES 
 ON THE ERNE.THE POTTERY OVERLOOKS THE 
 ERNE AND IT USED A WATERWHEEL TO      
 GRIND THE POTTERY INGREDIENTS AND     
 TO PROVIDE THE VILLAGE WITH ELECTRIC  
 LIGHTING MANY YEARS AGO.              </content>
