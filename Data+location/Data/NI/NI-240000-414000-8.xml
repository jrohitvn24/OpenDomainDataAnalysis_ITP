		<content>{Most people locally work in shops and 
{offices. Most of the offices are      
{fairly small. There is a new block of 
{offices on top of the Richmond Centre.
{This was built with government        
{money.On the lower floors of the      
{Richmond Centre there are many        
{shopping units. There are a few shirt 
{factories in the block we looked at.  
{There used to be many more shirt      
{factories but many of them have either
{closed or moved to new premises in the
{suburbs.These shirt factories give    
{lots of jobs for women.Unfortunately  
{many men do not have jobs. Beside our 
{school is a factory which is making   
{uniforms for the post office.It is    
{hoped this will mean this factory will
{have plenty of work for a long time to
{come.
