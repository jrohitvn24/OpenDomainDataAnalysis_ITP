		<title>01AREA AROUND DAMHEAD.</title>
		<content>  Our area lies between the towns of   
 Coleraine and Ballymoney. It is a     
 farming district.                     
  The area has many farms consisting of
 a large farm house, barns or outhouses
 and a milking parlour. Scattered here 
 and there between the farms are modern
 bungalows,some built beside derelict  
 cottages.                             
  The farmers specialise in producing  
 milk and the local creamery,located   
 just outside our grid, collects this  
 milk by tanker each day.              
  There is an Ulster Society for the   
 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals      
 Shelter located in this area.         
  Damhead Primary School looks after   
 the educatoinal needs of the children 
 aged between five and eleven.         
  One interesting method of trading,   
 just about to disappear, is a Mobile  
 Shop serving this farming community.  </content>
