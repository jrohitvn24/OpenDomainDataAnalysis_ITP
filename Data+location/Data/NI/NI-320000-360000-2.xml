 on the Cockhill Road.Water reeds and  
 long grass grow around the sides of   
 the the banks.A lot of trees hang over
 the river and a lot of wild flowers   
 swarm the banks.On a quiet day you can
 hearthe birds singing and the         
 grasshoppers hopping among the        
 grass.The fields on each side of the  
 Lagan are ploughed or are uneven      
 land.There are many different types of
 insects  such as the dragonfly.The    
 bridge that this part of the Lagan    
 flows under is a hump-back bridge.
