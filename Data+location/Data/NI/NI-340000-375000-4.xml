 Fisher Body is the name of a large    
 firm on the outskirts of Belfast. It  
 is a subsidary of General Motors, the 
 United States Car Firm. It has been in
 N.I. since 1979.It makes good quality 
 car accessories such as seat belts,   
 window regulators, knobs and handles. 
 The factory covers 28 acres and has   
 room for expansion if neccesary.The   
 firm employs 1000 people, over half of
 whom are women.                       
 Production is carried on 24's a day in
 three eight hour shifts.              
 General Motors chose the site in      
 Dundonald, 5 miles from Belfast,      
 because the plant was already         
 established,having formerly been      
 occupied by  Rolls Royce.             
 Fisher Body is one of the few         
 factories in Dundonald which supplies 
 employment.                           </content>
