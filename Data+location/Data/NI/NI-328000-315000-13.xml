		<title>13BIRTHDAY</title>
		<content>  My name is Linda Houston and here is 
 my account of how I spent Sunday 23rd 
 June 1985.                            
  I began the day in the Cranfield     
 Church Hall on the last day of our    
 Girls' Brigade camp. I was wakened at 
 9.00am and had breakfast. Some of my  
 friends and I went for a walk and     
 played games until 10.30am when we    
 walked back to the hall for our       
 morning service. Before Rev. McGaughey
 our minister arrived, everyone sang   
 "Happy Birthday" to me as I was twelve
 years old. My friends then gave me the
 birthday bumps. After the service I   
 checked all my clothes were in my case
 and got ready to go back to Kilkeel.  
  My parents picked me up at the church
 hall and we went home in time for     
 lunch. At about 2.30pm I opened my    
 cards and presents, some of which were
 very welcome surprises. Around 3.30pm </content>
