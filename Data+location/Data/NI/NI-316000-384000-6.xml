		<content>  There are four main Churches in the  
 area, Greystone Road Presbyterian     
 Church which serves the many new      
 estates on the fringe of Antrim New   
 Town, Muckamore Presbyterian Church on
 the South Eastern corner of the block 
 and serves the mainly rural community 
 of that area.  Opposite Greystone Road
 Presbyterian Church is St. Joseph's   
 Church which serves the Roman Catholic
 polulation of this part of Antrim Town
 and both were built as Newtown        
 Development.  In contrast with these  
 modern developments the Church of     
 Ireland Church in the area, St. Judes,
 has a long history, built on the site 
 of an old Monastry in l84l.  It was   
 renovated in l876.  As well as these  
 main church centres there are many    
 mission halls of varying faiths       
 throughout the area.
