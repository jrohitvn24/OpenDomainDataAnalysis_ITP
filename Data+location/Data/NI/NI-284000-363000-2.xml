		<title>02GEOGRAPHY AROUND COALISLAND</title>
		<content> This is an area of gently undulating  
 land with a large portion of WETLAND  
 to the East. This flat BOGLAND area   
 lies closest to LOUGH NEAGH and much  
 of it is wasteland. Local residents   
 however do dig their own TURF for use 
 in their fires and PEAT for their     
 gardens. The rest of the area is      
 mostly small hedged fields of grass   
 used for grazing while further West   
 hedges are removed and the fields     
 cultivated and used for SILAGE or HAY.
 An industrial estate lies to the      
 North-West corner of the block with   
 five or six factories employing local 
 people. Houses are mostly privately   
 owned, 3 to 4 bedroomed detached      
 bungalows set in their own gardens,   
 with two housing estates in the block.
 Apart from the garden flowers there   
 are a few wild flowers like BLUEBELLS 
 and the trees include BEECH and ASH.  </content>
