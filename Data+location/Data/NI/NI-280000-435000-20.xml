		<title>20The Bann Shore Portstewart</title>
		<content> Our walk along the Bann shore was a   
 sight-seeing one for the pupils of    
 Mr.Harbinson's and Miss Boyd's primary
 seven classes for we were looking     
 round us for various things of        
 interest to the Domesday Project. We  
 started walking along the Bann about a
 mile from the mouth of the river after
 walking through sand dunes owned by   
 the National Trust. On the other side 
 of the river were fields mainly used  
 for grass growing. We walked on grass 
 beside the river where we could see   
 fish jumping. Beside us was a private 
 golf course. Soon the grass became    
 marshy and tall reeds began to grow   
 and the path became so swampy that it 
 almost became too marshy to walk on.  
 When we reached a deep muddy ditch we 
 were forced to turn back just a few   
 hundred metres short of a disused and 
 overgrown quarry.                     </content>
