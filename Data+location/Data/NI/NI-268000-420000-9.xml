		<title>09THE JUNIOR ORANGE ORDER</title>
		<content> I'm a junior member of the Orange     
 Order and I attend Edenmore Orange    
 Hall one Thursday in every month.  My 
 uncle is an Orangeman and so is my    
 grandfather.  Some people ask me what 
 it's like and I always say that it's a
 bit like church.  We have a band and a
 beautiful banner.  On special days we 
 line up behind them and march through 
 the streets wearing our sashes.  The  
 best day of all is the twelfth of July
 when everybody is out at the same     
 time.  Last year we took a bus to     
 Londonderry and marched to a huge     
 field and had lemonade and crisps, and
 talked to all our friends. It was the 
 best day of the year.
