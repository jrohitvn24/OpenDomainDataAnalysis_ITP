		<content> The soils of the area are largely     
 derived from the glacial till from    
 which the drumlins are formed. This   
 produces a light sand and stony soil  
 with occasional large boulders in it. 
 In long established fields these      
 boulders may remain but recently      
 reclaimed fields (reclamation with the
 aid of a JCB type digger) have none.  
 The soils are fairly acid and on steep
 slopes are thin and poor. Even        
 relatively good fields may have an    
 outcrop of Shale bedrock.             
 Fields alongside the Muddock River    
 often experience flooding: blamed on  
 the Water Board which has an          
 extraction point on the MUddock and   
 which discharges Fofanny Reservoir    
 water into the Muddock. Generally the 
 fields at the bottom of the drumlin   
 slopes are ill-drained and often have 
 reeds growing on the pasture fields.  </content>
