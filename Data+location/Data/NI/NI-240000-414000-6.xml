		<content>{The docks have been in Londonderry for
{many years.During the Second World    
{War,battleships came in and out of the
{port. They came into the port to      
{refuel and to rest after or before the
{long and dangerous journey across the 
{Atlantic. The warships came from many 
{countries of the world like U.S.A.,   
{Canada, Norway,Denmark Portugal and   
{Holland. Ships come and go from the   
{port carrying goods such as oil, coal,
{cereals,timber and scrap metals.There 
{is a 492 ton ship in the port at the  
{moment called Tucan. It came from     
{Spain at Christmas and broke down at  
{Coleraine,Co.Londonderry.This ship has
{been auctioned and it seems that it   
{will be bought by a local man. He     
{hopes to get young unemployed people  
{to repair it and take grain to Ethiopa
