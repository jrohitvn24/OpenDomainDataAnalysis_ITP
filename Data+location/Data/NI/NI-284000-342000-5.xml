		<content> Milford  and the surrounding area was 
 once  very active with the mill in    
 the village and many small farms      
 functioning . In the immediate        
 neighbourhood,however, in recent times
 there has been a change due to the    
 closure of the mill and the decline in
 the farming community . When the mill 
 closed some people who lost their jobs
 left the area in search of employment.
 Others from the area  managed to get  
 employment in the Glenne factory which
 was owned by the same family as the   
 mill or else in Armagh in different   
 occupations.                          
   The farming community has declined  
 somewhat recently.Evidence of this is 
 seen in the number of apparently      
 abondoned homesteads.This decline is  
 most likely due to farms becoming more
 mechanized and small farmers not being
 able to afford to keep abreast.       </content>
