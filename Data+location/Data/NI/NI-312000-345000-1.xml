		<title>01INTRODUCTION BANBRIDGE</title>
		<content> Banbridge is one of the most          
 prosperous and attractive towns in    
 Northern Ireland.Since 1971 it has    
 experienced the fastest growth rate in
 the province.The population in 1985 is
 approximately 10,500.                 
   The town is a mixture of all three  
 sectors of the economy blended with   
 residential areas.While industries    
 such as Down Shoes provide employment 
 many people commute to Belfast.       
   The town centre has excellent modern
 shops and is well provided with banks 
 and other commercial offices.         
   The most striking feature for the   
 visitor must be the "CUT" a mid 19th  
 century bridge which some claim was   
 Ireland's first flyover.The town      
 centre has many attractive 19th       
 century buildings which unfortunately 
 have been defaced by ugly modern shop 
 fronts.                               </content>
