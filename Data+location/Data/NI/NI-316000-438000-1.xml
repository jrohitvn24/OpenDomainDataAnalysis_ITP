		<content> Rounded schist slopes are thickly     
 covered with glacial boulder clays so 
 that farmland is generally poorly     
 drained provides only coarse grazing  
 for sheep and cattle. Lower down the  
 River Carey is deeply incised between 
 flat topped, steep sided sandy        
 terraces that have been converted into
 better quality grassland and even     
 support crops of potatoes. Scattered  
 farmstead perch on the edge of the    
 drier soils and along the roadsides,  
 where newer houses belonging to people
 who work in Ballycastle are also      
 found. A sharp contrast to this open  
 landscape appears to the south where  
 welldeveloped stands of conifers mark 
 the outlines of Ballypatrick Forest.  
 There are a series of tracks thread up
 the wooded slopes of Crockaneel, a    
 favourite walking area for visitors   
 the year round.                       </content>
