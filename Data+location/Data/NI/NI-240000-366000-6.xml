		<content> These were in fact farmsteads used by 
 the{Celts }generally called forts.They
 were mainly circular in design and the
 land containing the house was         
 surrounded by an earthen bank or stone
 wall and a ditch.those surrounded by  
 earth banks were commonly called{     
{raths.}                               
             Forts varied greatly in   
 size but were usually 4O-5O metres in 
 diameter.There was only one entrance  
 which was closed at night.Animals     
 would have been brought inside at     
 night to keep them safe from wild     
 animals and thieves.                  
            To-day these forts are     
 overgrown with whins, blackthorns,    
 sally, ash and bramble. some country  
 people still refer to them as fairy   
 forts and regard them as magic places 
 where humans are not really safe .
