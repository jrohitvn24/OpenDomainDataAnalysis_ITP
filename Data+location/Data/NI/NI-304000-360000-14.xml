		<title>14Housing and Farming</title>
		<content>  When the new city of Craigavon was   
 being developed in the 1960's and 70's
 it led to quite a change in the land  
 usage around Lurgan.Land which had    
 previously been used for grazing and  
 farming was taken over for            
 recreational and industrial use.      
  In the area there are about 160 acres
 of rough grazing and 330 acres of     
 arable land.At present all of that is 
 being used for beef farming.          
  Housing in the area is confined to   
 isolated residences,mainly bungalows, 
 although two new housing estates are  
 being developed.One of these is close 
 to the M.1.Roundabout and the other is
 closer to the town,opposite           
 Tannaghmore School.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
