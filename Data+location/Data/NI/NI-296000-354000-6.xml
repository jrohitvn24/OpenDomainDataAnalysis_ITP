		<content>{SPRAYING} This is very important and  
 is carried out several times          
 (depending on the weather) during the 
 fruit-growing season. A chemical spray
 programme is required to control the  
 major apple diseases of mildew and    
 scab _the latter causing black spots  
 on the apples. Spraying is also used  
 to kill off apple pests such as       
 greenfly,red spider and caterpillar.

{HARVESTING }This stage usually begins 
 in August with the ripening of the    
 "Grenadier" crop (cooking apples),but 
 the main crop,the "Bramley Seedling", 
 is normally pulled at the end of      
 October. All pulling is done by hand  
 and great care must be taken to avoid 
 bruising the apples,for this would    
 destroy their keeping qualities. The  
 apples are stored in boxes,or more    
 recently in large wooden crates.      </content>
