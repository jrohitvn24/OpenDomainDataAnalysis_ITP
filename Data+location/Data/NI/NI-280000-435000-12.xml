		<title>12Community Week Portstewart</title>
		<content> The annual community week was opened  
 with a fancy dress competition which  
 paraded along the promenade. It was   
 then that community week was          
 officially opened. Then the night's   
 entertainment began. Old folk tunes   
 were played and the community queen   
 was chosen and crowned. There were 5  
 contestants. Last year's community    
 queen came to crown the new community 
 queen.                                
  Other events included the annual     
 inter-school sports and this year a   
 bed race was introduced which passed  
 through the town and finished at the  
 Pump-House. The winners received an   
 alarm clock. There was also a five-a  
 side competition and a treasure       
 hunt,although the weather for that    
 event was not very good.
