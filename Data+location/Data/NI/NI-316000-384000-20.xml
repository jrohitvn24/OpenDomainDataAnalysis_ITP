		<content> This block concerned in this study is 
 situated on the fringe of the         
 residential development, as designated
 by the Antrim Newtown Plan.  The      
 housing can be divided into two       
 socially and territorially distinct   
 areas bordering one another. The area 
 includes privately owned houses and   
 Housing Executive (public) houses.    
 The large residential development was 
 originally meant to cater for the     
 increase in population brought about  
 by the incentives of employment and   
 resettlement grants on offer in the   
 early and mid l970's.  One of the main
 employers then was the large Enkalon  
 Factory which employed over 3000      
 people.  Many of the people in this   
 block moved to Antrim between l0 and  
 l5 years ago.
