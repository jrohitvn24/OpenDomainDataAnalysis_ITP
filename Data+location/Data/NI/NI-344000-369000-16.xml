{ }Our group was shown around this big 
 building.  It was like a hotel with   
 carpets, pictures and a clock.  It had
 a cosy, home-like atmosphere.  There  
 was accomodation for 40 permanent     
 residents amd five holiday ones.  Some
 were sitting outside in the sun and   
 some wandering about and others were  
 relaxing in lounges and some were in  
 bedrooms or bathing.  There are 11 day
 staff and 2 night staff.  They work in
 shifts.  There are 3 lounges with     
 televisions and one quiet lounge.     
 There are 35 single rooms and 5 double
 rooms. There are 3 dining rooms. There
 is also an office, a duty room, a     
 sewing room, and rooms for washing,   
 drying, hairdressing, bathing,        
 activities and doctors.  The old folk 
 are encouraged to be independent.
