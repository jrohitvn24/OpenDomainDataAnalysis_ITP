		<content>{ The Post Office}wasn't always in the 
 present spot,it used to be around the 
 corner where it was used as a grocers 
 shop.                                 
  Previously,there was no{Post Office  
 and when a pub owner died the new     
 owner was not granted a "Drink        
 Licence"and he made it into a{Post    
{Office}.It then moved to its present  
 site which was previously a{Green     
{grocers}.The{Post Office}is now the   
 downstairs of a small house.The front 
 door is the main entrance but the{Post
{Office}is now used by over 100 people.
  The{Post Office}sells some sweets and
 drinks as well as normal postal trade.
 It is a regular meeting place for the 
 local people of Roughfort.It provides 
 information about local events,bus    
 timetables,and Mrs Campbell the       
 Postmistress is a fund of information 
 about the area.                       </content>
