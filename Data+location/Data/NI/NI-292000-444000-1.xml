 for grazing sheep and beef cattle.

 this block. A very dramatic area with 
 sheer cliffs of basalt, giving the    
 famous columns and hexagonal blocks,  
 known all over the world. It therefore
 attracts large numbers of people      
 of all nationalities and occupations  
 and all with diferent reasons to visit
 the area.

 months from April to October, ranging 
 from school parties and families to   
 hikers and geologists. A Visitors     
 Centre  is built at this moment and   
 will be fully operational by April 86 </content>
