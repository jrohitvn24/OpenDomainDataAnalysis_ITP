		<content>  Agriculture is the "back bone" in    
 the economy of the area. The average  
 farm size is 22 hectares &amp; very little
 land is ploughed because of high      
 annual rainfall (1100 mm) &amp; a poorly  
 drained glacial soil.99% of the       
 drumlin landscape is used for         
 grassland. Cattle must be housed &amp;    
 fed on silage or hay for 6 months. As 
 a result farm yard buildings have     
 improved, Cubicle houses, easy feed or
 self feed houses and milking parlours 
 are now found on progressive farms.   
 This means high capital investment,   
 increased efficiency &amp; output but     
 lower labour requirements. Farming has
 become more specialized, concentrating
 on beef or dairying. The stock ratio  
 per hectare has improved due to land  
 drainage schemes, reseeding &amp;         
 increased use of fertilizers.         
 Many small farms have amalgamated.    </content>
