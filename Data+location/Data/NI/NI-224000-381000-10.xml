		<title>10THE DERG IN THE 18TH CENTURY</title>
		<content> Mr John Gamble a famous author and    
 historian of the 18th Century wrote of
 his trips around Ireland.  In his book
 or series of letters "Views of Society
 and Manners in the North of Ireland   
 written in the year 1818," he recalls 
 his walk from Strabane through the    
 Derg Valley passing through Castlederg
 or Derg as it was called then.  A     
 brief extract from the above book will
 show his impressions of the area _ "we
 passed through the little town of     
 Derg.  It is a pretty one, and        
 romantically situated; but the bridge 
 is narrow and inconvenient, and, as it
 was a fair day, we had great          
 difficulty in getting along it.  By a 
 perverse choice, it is the place where
 the yarn market is held, and our broad
 conveyance nearly spread from one side
 to the other,to the confusion both of 
 buyers and sellers.                   </content>
