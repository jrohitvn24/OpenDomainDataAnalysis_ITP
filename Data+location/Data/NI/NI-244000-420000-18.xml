  In 1932 the Watt Thornhill Estate was
 bought by Mother Mary Benchmans.      
 Situated in the picturesque banks of  
 the Foyle,a large barn was converted  
 into 2 classrooms and the roofspace   
 into a prayer_room.Here subjects      
 ranged from Irish,French,English,RE,  
 History,Geography and Sciences.Then   
 all teachers and pupils could easily  
 have been fitted into 1 classroom.From
 1932 onwards the school developed and 
 gained a reputation in education.In   
 1959 further plans were made for a new
 building to accommodate 350 pupils.In 
 November 1968,the canteen was opened; 
 in 1973,the sports hall,in 1974 6     
 chalets and in 1978 a new block was   
 built which came into use in 1980.Now,
 over 1500 pupils attend the all girls 
 grammar school and there is a staff of
 82 teachers.                          </content>
