		<content> Most people finish work around 6pm    
 unless they work on a farm or fish on 
 Lough Neagh in which case their hours 
 of leisure are much less during the   
 busy season from May to September.    
      Apart from watching T.V. or      
 videos, which are found in almost     
 every home, the young people in this  
 area go to the local YOUTH CLUB. The  
 old school at Annaghmore crossroads is
 used as a youth club, a playschool and
 a BINGO hall. The youth club, apart   
 from providing opportunities for boys 
 and girls of 8 to 16 to play lots of  
 games, go swimming and learn crafts,  
 also organises DISCOS, CHARITY WALKS  
 and DAY TRIPS. Many young girls play  
 CAMOGIE with the local team while the 
 boys have their own football. There is
 a widespread interest in snooker in   
 the area among both young boys and    
 older men        (ctd page 12)        </content>
