		<content>   In and around Comber there are      
 little river_bank walks where wildlife
 flourishes.  In the surrounding       
 countryside there are rough patches   
 and swamp areas.  Unfortunately,      
 farmers have cut hedges low and used  
 sprays which reduce the bird and      
 animal wildlife but they have spotted 
 their mistake and now are letting     
 hedges grow for shelter.              
   We walked along the old railway     
 track and saw a lot of beautiful      
 flowers and butterflies _ we even had 
 the chance of seeing a butterfly      
 called an{orange tip}.                
   The Council are going to make proper
 walkways along the river banks so that
 people can walk their dogs without    
 hearing the noise of the traffic.     
   Recently the River Enler was        
 polluted by a toxic substance but     
 happily we saw a small fish today.    </content>
