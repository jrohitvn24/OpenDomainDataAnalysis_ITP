		<content> Farming;  Almost all of the land in   
 this area is given over to farming.   
 The areas of rough grassland are used 
 for sheep and during the summer the   
 drier parts of the wet land is used   
 for grazing.                          
 Most of the farming is of a mixed type
 and livestock are kept and crops are  
 grown on most farms. Only one farm is 
 almost exclusively given over to dairy
 farming with a large herd of Friesian 
 cows.                                 
 Cattle are bred, fattened and sent to 
 market. Various types of cattle are   
 kept even on one farm. Short Horn,    
 Hereford, Friesian and Charolais are  
 among the most popular breeds.        
 Sheep are also bred mainly for meat _ 
 lamb and mutton.
