		<title>11A Trip by Train</title>
		<content>                                       
 We boarded the train at Lurgan        
 Station. The train increased speed    
 very slowly.  By the time we had      
 passed Lake Street and Bell's Row     
 level crossing we were going at full  
 speed.  There were more cars at Lake  
 Street level crossing but the man who 
 opens the gates at Bell's Row waved at
 us.                                   
    On a hill on the left we could see 
 St. Michael's High School.  My big    
 brother goes there.                   
    The first bridge past Bell's row is
 just outside our school's area in the 
 Domesday Project.  We went through a  
 cutting and we could not see          
 Providence Hostel owned by the Sisters
 of Mercy.  Out of the cutting down    
 below us we could see St. Theresa's   
 primary school.   T.McAtasney
