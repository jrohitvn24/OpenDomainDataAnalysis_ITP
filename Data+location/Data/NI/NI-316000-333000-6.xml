		<content>   MIXED FARMING IS QUITE COMMON IN THE
 RATHFRILAND DISTRICT. THE FARMERS WHO 
 CHOOSE THIS TYPE OF FARMING HAVE A    
 SELECTION OF ANIMALS AND CROPS ON     
 THEIR FARMS.CROPS MAY VARY GREATLY AND
 THESE INCLUDE OATS, BARLEY, SILAGE,   
 HAY, POTATOES AND TURNIPS. OILSEED    
 RAPE IS THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN     
 CROPS IN THIS AREA. ALL THESE CROPS   
 ARE USED AS FODDER FOR ANIMALS AND    
 SOME ARE ALSO SOLD TO OTHER COUNTRIES.
   ANIMALS REARED ON THESE FARMS       
 INCLUDE SHEEP, CATTLE AND PIGS. A LOT 
 OF PREPARATION AND TIME IS SPENT IN   
 THE REARING OF THESE ANIMALS. THESE   
 ANIMALS ARE USUALLY SOLD IN THE LOCAL 
 LIVESTOCK MARKET.
