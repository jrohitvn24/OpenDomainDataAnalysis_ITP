		<content>  This are is very thinly populated and
 settlements tend to be spasmodic.     
 Farms of small acreage predominate.   
 The better farmland lies near the     
 River Bann and it is intensively used 
 for dairy and beef farming. Parts of  
 the area contain bogland and this is  
 cut for turf which is used for fuel.  
 Communications are limited and the    
 area is served by 1 main road. There  
 are very few public amenities in the  
 area, shopping, entertainment and     
 other forms of social activity are    
 served and met in the nearby town of  
 Kilrea. Though the area is quite      
 scenic near the River Bann where there
 is a decidious forest.
