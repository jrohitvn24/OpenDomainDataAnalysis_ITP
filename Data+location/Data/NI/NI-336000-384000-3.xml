		<content>{  Nursery}Education is not available  
 in the Greenisland area so the primary
 schools admit pupils at 4 years. Pre- 
 school provision is made by a{play-   
{group}run by the social services in   
 the Social Centre and a voluntary     
 group held in the Methodist Hall.     
   Greenisland children have 2 local   
{controlled}primary schools{Greenisland
{P.S}(250 pupils)sited near the railway
 station and{Silverstream P.S}(150) in 
 the lower estate.Near Station Road is 
 a{maintained}school{(St.Colman's P.S.,
 20 pupils).Parents may send children  
 to any primary or preparatory school  
 inside or outside their area.         
{ }In common with most N.I. children,  
 local primary pupils,in their 11th    
 year,take part in a{selection test}   
 designed to assess their suitability  
 for the 2 types of secondary schools  
 provided.                             </content>
