		<title>17FARM LIFE</title>
		<content>   As a 13-year old living on a farm in
 our survey area,I have a very         
 busy,varied and interesting life.     
 I travel daily by bus to Killicomaine 
 School in Portadown,but my brother    
 attends Richmount,the local primary,  
 and is collected by mini-bus.We       
 transfer from the primary school at   
 11+.When I stay after school for choir
 hockey practice or drama society I    
 have to be collected by car because   
 there is no bus suitable.             
  Before I leave each morning I attend 
 to the hens,while Tom brings in the   
 cows for milking.I unlock the hen-    
 house,feed them,collect eggs and let  
 them loose.I have to lock them up     
 every night to save them from foxes.In
 winter I help give silage to the      
 cattle and feed the pigs.Spring is a  
 busy time preparing the fields for    
 seeding or planting.                  </content>
