		<title>01Our Domesday Area</title>
		<content> The  area  which we have been studying
 lies  to  the  west  of  the  town  of
{Ballyclare}and north of the village of
{Doagh.}It is  mainly{agricultural land
 with a  scattering  of farms, churches
 and  rivers.  Most  of these items are
 described in the pages which follow.  
                                       
 The principal {village }in the area is
 Burnside. At  Kilbride  there  are two
 churches...the Parish  Church  and the
 Presbyterian Church. The  graveyard at
 the  Presbyterian Church  is  very old
 and has many interesting headstones.  
                                       
 There are two  main  factories  in our
 area...Doagh  Spinning  Mill and Gowdy
 Engineering Works.
