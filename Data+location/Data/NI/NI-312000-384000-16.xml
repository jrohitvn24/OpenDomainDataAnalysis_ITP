  Nearer the town we next come upon the
 Antrim Forum Leisure Centre and       
 Running track where many famous       
 athletes have taken part in           
 various events.The Leisure Centre is  
 equiped with a pool,squash court etc. 
  Across the Sixmilewater you can      
 see the Italian Tower which is the    
 only ruin left after Antrim Castle was
 burnt in 1922.                        
   Finally we come to Pogue's Entry    
 where Anna and Jamie Irvine lived     
 during the Famine,and where Alexander 
 Irvine grew up.                       
   His ashes were buried beside his    
 mother and father in the nearby church
 yard.
