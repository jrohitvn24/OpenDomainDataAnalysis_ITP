		<content> At the weekends the football team uses
 the centre as a changing facility.They
 are then able to go across to the     
 playing field which is also in our    
 block,play their match,go back to the 
 centre and have tea and showers.      
          {SCHOOLS}                    
 In the map of our block one can find  
 traces of two old schools.They are in 
 an area known as Altnaveigh.These two 
 schools no longer exist even though   
 the buildings are still standing.They 
 closed because the scattered farming  
 population had moved on,leaving too   
 few children to keep them open.       
 As the housing estates started to grow
 on the eastern slopes of our area,a   
 new school was needed.It opened in    
 1982.It is a mixed primary school and 
 it has a nursery section.It is called 
 St.Malachy's.
