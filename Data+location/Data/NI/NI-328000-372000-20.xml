		<content>  {Irish dancing}is a popular interest 
 among the children of Belfast. In West
 Belfast alone there are nine different
 schools of dancing, and inter-school  
 competitions are a regular occurrence.
 Many of the children also compete at a
 national level.                       
   The{City of Belfast School of Music 
 provides a peripetetic teaching       
 service in our schools. String, brass,
 and woodwind instruments are taught at
 primary and secondary level. The      
 children have the opportunity to      
 participate in group activities at the
 School of Music until they are 18     
 years old.
