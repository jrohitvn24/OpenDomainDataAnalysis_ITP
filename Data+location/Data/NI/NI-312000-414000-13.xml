		<title>13RELIGION IN OUR PARISH</title>
		<content> Our area,{Glenravel}is populated      
 mostly by Catholics. A new Church was 
 dedicated in 1983.  It was opened by  
{Bishop Daly}and his assistant Bishops 
 Patrick and Anthony. The Parish Priest
 is{Fr. Teggart}and the Curate is Fr.  
 Kennedy. I was babtised by Fr. Maginn 
 but shortly after he died. Then came  
 Fr. Teggart to carry on his work. My  
 baptism took place in a{temporary     
{Church}because the old church was     
{bombed in 1972.}But we have a lovely  
 new Church now and that is forgotten. 
 It is Cruciform in shape.  It seats   
 700 and has two side Altars.The       
 outside is done in{Donegal  stone.}   
 It is a beautiful Church and is named 
{Mary Queen of Peace.
