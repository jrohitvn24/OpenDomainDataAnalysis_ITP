		<content> This area is approximately 2/3 land   
 and 1/3 sea.  Here quite literally    
 'The Mountains of Howne sweep down to 
 the sea' as Percy French's song says. 
 To the left of the grid are the peaks 
 of Spences Mountain Chimney Rock and  
 other maintains rising to             
 approximately 1500 metrs.  They are   
 covered by rough heathland with two   
 rivers running to sea.  The mountains 
 slope quite steeply to the sea ending 
 in cliffs about 50-100m higih with    
 rocky sea shore. The main Belfast to  
 Kilkeel road runs along the seashore  
 in a directly N-S direction.  The area
 is only sparsely inhabite with houses 
 mainly along main road and some       
 development mainly derelict on        
 mountain side. One main feature is    
 building of a new water pipe from     
 Silent Valley to Belfast which skirts 
 mountain causing a rough scar.        </content>
