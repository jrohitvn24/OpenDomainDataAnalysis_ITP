		<title>02INTRODUCTION TO FARMING</title>
		<content>   Farming in {Roughfort}is mainly     
 pasture farming. There are generally  
 small farms in our block. The largest 
 being 80 acres, the smallest is 41    
 acres. There was some land for grazing
 cattle,sheep and goats. One farmer {Mr
{McBride} supplied milk to {Dale Farm  
{Dairies}in Ballymena. This was        
 collected twice daily,in the morning  
 and in the evening.                   
   The grass left over was turned into 
 hay and silage or in some cases it was
 sent to poorer farms.                 
   Helpers were employed at the farms  
 from nearby on a daily basis. The     
 helpers usually had to build up fences
 around the fields. In some farms,     
 electric fences were installed. The   
 biggest farms turned out to be the    
 oldest because they had developed over
 the years.
