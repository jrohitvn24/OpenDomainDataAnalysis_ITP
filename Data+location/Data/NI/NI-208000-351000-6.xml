		<title>06CRANNOG ON CARRICK LAKE</title>
		<content> The townland of Carrick is situated to
 the north-west of Derrygonnelly.      
 Historically it is an interesting area
 offering a few notable features.The   
 Crannog, which one could describe as a
 small island farmstead, was           
 artifically made.The name "Crannog"   
 derives from the Irish Crann (a tree),
 probably because of the many trees    
 used to secure the foundation.It dates
 back to the Late Bronze Age and  Early
 Christian Times. It could also have   
 been used for protection against enemy
 tribes as well as wild animals.
