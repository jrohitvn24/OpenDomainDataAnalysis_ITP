		<title>12School Trip</title>
		<content>  On Monday the 24th of June we went on
 a school trip to Fermanagh. The places
 we visited were Devenish Island, the  
 Lakeland Forum, Navan Fort and St.    
 Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh.        
  Navan Fort encloses a field in which 
 there are hills and ditches. There was
 once a castle on this site. It dates  
 back to the time of the Vikings.      
   We went on a water-bus to Devenish  
 Island. On the island there is a round
 tower. It was used as a look-out tower
 in warning of the Vikings. The Vikings
 raided and plundered Devenish. They   
 stole from the monasteries. In one of 
 the huts there is a tomb; in another  
 there is a rock moulded into a bowl   
 which has a hole in it. There is a    
 cross in the middle of the island. It 
 is the Devenish Cross. We went for a  
 swim in the Lakeland Forum.
