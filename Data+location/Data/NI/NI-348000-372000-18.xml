		<title>18TOURISM IN NEWTOWNARDS</title>
		<content> Newtownards situated at the head of   
 Strangford Lough is l6km from Belfast.
 Tourists passing through the thriving 
 Market town on their way to the nearby
 coastal towns and bird sanctuaries    
 will find many interesting and        
 historical features. The streets with 
 many pink Scrabo sandstone houses     
 radiate from Conway Square - locally  
 nicknamed "Ireland's Horseguard's     
 Parade" because of its spaciousness   
 and large Georgian Town Hall which was
 formerly the Market house. It contains
 an interesting old lock-up with       
 corbelled roof. In the High Street    
 stands the octagonal old Market Cross 
 built in l636 which had a room inside 
 used by the police. To the west of the
 town is a large hyper market which    
 reflects modern living patterns.
