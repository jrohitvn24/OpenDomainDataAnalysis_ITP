		<content> Situated at intervals along the middle
 of most 'B'and'C'class roads in the   
 country are "cats eyes". These are a  
 great help in guiding road users at   
 night or in foggy conditions.         
 These are made of two glass prisms,   
 with an aluminium reflector at the    
 back of each.  This reflects the      
 lights of on_coming traffic towards   
 the motorist.  When a car runs over a 
 cat's eye it sinks down into a bed of 
 rubber and the glass is cleaned on    
 small ridges.  (Invented 1934. Shaw)  
 Cats Eyes have undoubtedly help save  
 many lives over the years, but at     
 present these are only installed on   
 the main roads in this area. Surely   
 something of this nature is needed on 
 all roadways as it is usually the     
 narrower more twisting country roads  
 which are most dangerous.
