		<title>16LOCAL HISTORY OF BANBRIDGE 1</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
                                       
 Banbridge is situated in the townland 
 of Ballyvalley which in Irish means   
 "the townland of the road".  The      
 earliest reference to Banbridge is in 
 1691 and the stone bridge over the    
 Bann was built in 1712.               
 The growth of Banbridge was largely   
 due to the linen industry.  The       
 farmers in the area grew flax and at  
 first the industry was domestic.      
 However, in the nineteenth century a  
 number of large mills and factories   
 were built along the River Bann and   
 Banbridge became a major centre for   
 the linen industry.
