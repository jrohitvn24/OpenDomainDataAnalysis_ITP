		<title>15Rehaghy Orange hall</title>
		<content>   One of the buildings in our area    
 is {Rehaghy Orange Hall.} The hall    
 consists of one main room which has an
 old fashioned upright stove that      
 provides heat when the hall is being  
 used.  The hall is built of stone, the
 walls being white_washed with a       
 corrugated iron roof.  The hall was   
 once used as a school and there used  
 to be dances held in it.  Today the   
 hall is owned by the{Orange Lodge}    
 which has an{accordian band}of its    
 own.  A band practice is held once a  
 week and each month there is a{lodge  
{meeting. }No one knows when the hall  
 was built but some people say it was  
 in the{nineteenth century.
