 Dinsmore.Bleahing,dyeing and finishing
 cloth is done in it.The bails of cloth
 are brought in lorries.The one which  
 is going to be white is bleached and  
 washed and the one which is going to  
 be dyed is just washed.Then it is dyed
 then it is passed through mangle      
 rollers and through a stetnter which  
 stretches it to a certain width and   
 then it drys it at that width. Next it
 is put on big rolls or cut and put in 
 parcels depending on what the customer
