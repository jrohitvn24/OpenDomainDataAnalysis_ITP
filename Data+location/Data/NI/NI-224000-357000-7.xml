		<title>07School Examinations</title>
		<content>   Our school exams take place twice   
 a year. They are held in the gym and  
 everyone comes in together. The first 
 exams were at Christmas. I found it   
 very strange and I worried a lot      
 because it was my first time to do    
 exams of this kind.                   
     The exam results come by post.  We
 are given a grade from A-E, for each  
 subject.  A is excellent and E is the 
 lowest grade.  Each teacher  writes an
 individual comment on her own subject 
 and the form teacher writes a full    
 report on our progress.               
     The second exams I did were at the
 end of my first year.  This time I    
 prepared better and did not  worry so 
 much.  The hall where the exams were  
 held was completely silent except for 
 the rattle of teachers' feet as they  
 walked up and down to make sure that  
 we did not copy.                      </content>
