		<content> For recreation Mrs. Morton told us    
 that there were socials on some       
 evenings. On some other evenings in   
 the church hall there is a badminton  
 club to which  her children go.They   
 also go to discos in the church hall  
 which are run by the youth club.The   
 older members of the family go to     
 dances or sometimes visit old people  
 of the community who are lonely and   
 cannot walk far.                      
  In times past the man of the family  
 would compete in horsetrials against  
 other families.                       
  She told us that the land surrounding
 her house has not changed in the past 
 thirty years and there was not much   
 industry in the area. Most people who 
 work in the community are employed as 
 workers on farms near their homes.
