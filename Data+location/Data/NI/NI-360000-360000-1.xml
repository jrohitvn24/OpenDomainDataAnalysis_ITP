        The area under examination lies
 centrally in the Ards Peninsula.      
 Glaciation has left very distinctive  
 features, especially the undulating   
 nature of the countryside. The terrain
 is dotted with dozens of small hills, 
 none of which is more than 40 feet    
 above sea level. Large boulders have  
 been deposited around the shores of   
 the Peninsula, moved many miles away  
 from their original sites.            
  The Peninsula is approx. 6 kilometers
 in width, almost completely surrounded
 by the Irish Sea &amp; Strangford Lough.  
 The influence upon the climate is     
 strong: throughout the year           
 temperatures are very mild, not very  
 hot in summer and little frost or snow
 in winter. There is rainfall all year 
 round, but the area is free drained.  
 It is also fertile land.              </content>
