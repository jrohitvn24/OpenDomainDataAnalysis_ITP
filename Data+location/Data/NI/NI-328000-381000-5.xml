		<content> at Ferndale Road, Burnthill Crescent, 
 and the Antrim Road at Swanston Park  
 are also being used for new houses.   
 A larger development of timber framed 
 houses are being built at Ballyhenry  
 Gardens and adjacent Dorchester       
 Gardens.                              
   All ages of the community live in   
 Glengormley and the area has blossomed
 over the past 20 years with easy      
 access to Belfast and the rest of the 
 province via the M2.                  
   About 75% of houses in the area are 
 semidetached with newer houses being  
 increasingly bungalows and detached   
 homes.  Older pre war houses are found
 along the main roads, with newer      
 houses filling areas between.         
 Traditionally built brick houses with 
 local N. Ireland bricks, tiles and    
 limestone chipping constitute 90% of  
 the houses, the remaining 10% are new </content>
