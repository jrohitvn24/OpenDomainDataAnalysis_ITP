		<title>20      The Local Farms</title>
		<content> In This distric is mostly farming most
 of the farms are dairy farms the farms
 keep cows to supply milk. They also   
 breed so calves can replace the that  
 get old In the spring they make silage
 for the cows in the winter. They also 
 make some hay for the young stock.    
 Cattle graze in the fields from May to
 October some farmers divide their     
 fields into acre paddocks. In winter  
 the cows feed on silage and nuts.     
 Nuts are concentrated meal pressed    
 into a long round nut. They are housed
 uasally in cubicle hoeses and help    
 themsleves to silage. They are milked 
 in a milking palour twice a day and   
 the milk is stored  in large          
 rifrigerated tanks. A lorry comes and 
 collects the milk ever day and takes  
 it to be pasteurized bottled and      
 delivered to peoples houses. It is    
 also made into butter and cream.      </content>
