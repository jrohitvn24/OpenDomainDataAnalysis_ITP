		<content> British Bulldogs is the most popular  
 game for boys, and for girls, German  
 jumps. You play German jumps by having
 elastic bands joined together and two 
 people put it round their ankles at   
 each end. Then another person jumps   
 over and on the elastic. If she does  
 it all right they move the elastic up 
 to their knees and she does it again. 
 If again successful they move it up to
 their waists, then under their arms   
 and then their necks but when it      
 reaches their necks the one who has   
 been jumping sways from side to side  
 saying the days of the week. When it  
 reaches Sunday the people hold up the 
 elastic and the one in the middle has 
 to jump up and try to catch it with   
 her chin. Success means she starts all
 over again.
