		<content> Muckamore Cricket and Tennis Clubs is 
 found on our block.  The Cricket Club 
 was the founding club in l874 by John 
 Joseph Robinson who had connections   
 with York Street Flax Spinning Company
 in Belfast.  Over its long history the
 Club took some time to reach the      
 ambition of Senior League Status.     
 This was achieved in l955.  Since then
 the Club's fortunes have been a       
 succession of triumphs and            
 disappointments moving to and from    
 Senior League, at present in Senior   
 League Section 2.                     
 The Tennis Club was founded in l908   
 after some years of informal matches  
 played on the cricket outfield.       
 The Club became a social centre in the
 area.  The Club flourished and had its
 best years in the l950's. A decline in
 the l960's has been followed by a     
 gradual revival.                      </content>
