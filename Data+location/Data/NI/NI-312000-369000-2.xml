		<content>    A fair number of the scattered     
 inhabitants engage,under license, in  
 eel-fishing on Lough Neagh, which     
 touches the western edge of this      
 block. This is the largest body of    
 fresh water in the British Isles,     
 being some 25km north-south and 15km  
 east-west.                            
    SAND is extracted from the Lough on
 the western edge of the block and     
 elsewlere outside the area. Also it is
 expected that LIGNITE extraction, a   
 fairly major operation already begun  
 just to the north, will commence      
 within the block in a year or so.     
    There is also a tendency to        
 market-gardening, in some instances   
 highly successful.                    
    Roads are good to excellent, though
 there are a few notorious twists and  
 bends on bye- roads.      (Cont'd...)
