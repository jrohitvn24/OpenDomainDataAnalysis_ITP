		<title>18OUR GAMES</title>
		<content> In the summer a favourite game that   
 the girls play is{camogie}which is    
 the same as  hurly only for girls     
 instead of boys.Sometimes it gets     
 very rough but its usually good fun.  
 It is played by striking a{small      
{leather ball with a stick}into the    
 opponents goals.  It sounds easy but  
 the other team is forever tackling and
 taking the ball off you.  The idea is 
 one team trying to score into the     
 goals and the other team hitting out. 
 Another game we play is{hop_scotch.}It
 is not as popular as some other games 
 because its very old fashioned but can
 be quite good when mixed with a{bit of
{cheating.}In winter when the snow has 
 come the game everyone plays  (girls  
 and boys){is snowball fighting.}Its   
 great so long as you don't mind       
 getting soaked.                       
                                       </content>
