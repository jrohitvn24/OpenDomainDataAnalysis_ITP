		<content>    Glenavy dates from the time of     
 St,Patrick, A.D.450, who built a      
 church there. A dwarf named Daniel who
 was put in charge gave the district   
 its name- "lann abhaich"- Gaelic for  
 "church of the dwarf".This became     
 Lennavy, the initial "G" being a later
 corruption.                           
    On nearby Ram's Island stand the   
 remains of a round tower dating from  
 the Norse invasions, A.D.800. A large 
 Viking fleet was stationed on Lough   
 Neagh for some time.                  
    Glenavy remained part of the vast  
 estates of the O'Neills of Ulster     
 until Elizabethan times. Following the
 Flight of the Earls in 1607 the       
 district came under the rule of       
 zenglish settlers and subsequently was
 administered by the Conway, Seymour,  
 hertford and wallace families.
