		<title>18WOODBURN/KNOCKAGH WALK.</title>
		<content> We decided to leave the car behind and
 set out for a walk to Knockagh. We    
 went up the Woodburn Road past        
 Woodlawn Playing Fields, Kernohan's,  
 "The Pheasant" up to Gault's shop and 
 on to Woodburn School. We turned left 
 on to the Knockagh Road. We went in   
 past Dorisland reservoir and across a 
 couple of fields towards Knockagh. In 
 one field a big bull eyed us and began
 to run towards us. We ran across the  
 field, jumped over a stream and       
 scrambled  over the fence to the      
 safety of the nearby road. We         
 hitch-hiked back to Gault's shop where
 we bought some lemonade and chocolate 
 biscuits. Later on we found out that  
 the bull belonged to Barron's         
 mentioned on Page 12.
