		<content>      Every year there is a fete at    
 Loughshore Park.This year it was on   
 Saturday,22nd June and I went with my 
 brother and my Mum and Dad.           
      We planned to get there at 2.00  
 p.m. as that is when they hold the    
 Raft Race. This was brilliant. A whole
 lot of people had made rafts out of   
 different things and they raced to see
 which was the best. It was really     
 funny because some sank as soon as    
 they were put in the water and others 
 hadn't very good steering and went off
 course. There was a lot of cheating   
 and some rafts had made flour bombs to
 pelt their opponents and then ram them
 to try and sink them. In the end most 
 people ended up in the sea.           
      There were other side_shows and  
 things to try. The best was the       
 helicopter rides but my dad said it   
 was too dear to go up in it.          </content>
