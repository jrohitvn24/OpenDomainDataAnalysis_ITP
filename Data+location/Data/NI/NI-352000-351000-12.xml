		<content> Jackdaw Island which the Trust manages
 is particularly important for nesting 
 birds. It is home for four types of   
 Tern,the Artic,Common,Roseate and     
 Sandwich. Last year,1984,Jackdaw      
 Island had 40% of all the nesting     
 Sandwich Terns in Ireland. The Tern   
 shares its home with Oyster           
 Catchers,Ring Pluvers, Shell Ducks,   
 Canadian Geese and Barnacle Geese.    
 Dunnyneill Islands are also managed by
 the Trust and home for many birds.    
   The Trust also lease the foreshore  
 along the Lough and are therefore     
 able to control the Wildfowling which 
 takes place as there are many clubs in
 the area.
