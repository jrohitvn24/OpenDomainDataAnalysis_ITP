		<title>05The Lagan Canal</title>
		<content> The Lagan Canal runs through our      
 block, but it is now disused. We went 
 to see it and it is fallen into       
 disrepair. The banks are broken down  
 and there is hardly any water in it.  
 But once barges carrying goods        
 travelled from Belfast to Lough Neagh.
  Work began on the canal in 1756 but  
 it wasn't finished till after 1779.   
 The canal was 27 miles long and had   
 cost Â£108,231 to build. It had 27     
 locks, 10 of them in a four-mile      
 stretch between Ellis's Gut at Lough  
 Neagh and the village of Aghalee.     
  The canal was taken over by the Lagan
 Navigation Co. in 1843. At the height 
 of the canal's use it carried 174,000 
 tons of trade annually, but by 1938   
 this had decreased to 46,000 tons. The
 canal was still in use up to 1954 and 
 carried coal from Belfast and farm    
 produce to Belfast. C.McConville      </content>
