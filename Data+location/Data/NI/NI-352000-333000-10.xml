		<title>10how to play skittles</title>
		<content> Two players can play skittles at one  
 time,with eight players in each team. 
 There are five pegs each representing 
 different numbers of points from one  
 to five.Each player has three skittles
 and the first to reach 0 from 41      
 points wins the game.IF you go past 41
 points you are bust and you go back   
 to nine.A player throws the skittle   
 from a distance of twentyeight        
 feet.When the peg is knocked down it  
 stays down for the rest of that       
 players throws.The pegs are seven     
 centimetres high and the skittles are 
 nineteen centimetres long and made    
 from wood.There is a butt line about  
 30cm from the ring which the skittle  
 must go over before recording a score.
 This a local game and now become      
 popular in County Down.
