		<title>19MY SCHOOL DAY</title>
		<content> I normally wake up at half past seven.
 After I have washed and dressed I eat 
 my breakfast,usually cornflakes and a 
 cup of tea.We say our morning prayers.
 I be at the end of the lane at 8.30 to
 get the school bus. We be in school at
 9.05. During the day we have two 15   
 minute breaks,the first at 11.00 when 
 most of us take milk and the next at  
 12.30, when we have our dinner        
 cooked in school, or a packed lunch   
 from home. The bus arrives at twenty  
 past three to take us home.After doing
 my homework.I watch television.My     
 favourite programmes are "Scrabble,   
 "Bewitched" and "The Hillbillies." We 
 have our supper at half past eight.My 
 two brothers go to bed then.I stay up 
 to watch television.At eleven o'clock 
 I go to bed.
