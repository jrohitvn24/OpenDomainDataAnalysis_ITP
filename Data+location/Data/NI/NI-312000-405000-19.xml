		<title>19MICHELIN TYRE FACTORY</title>
		<content>   Michelin is situated just beside the
 Golf Course about a mile outside      
 Broughshane and was opened in 1969.The
 factory is just 1 of 54 worldwide.In  
 just that one factory 9,000_10,000    
 tyres are produced each week and      
 around 1,000 people are employed      
 there.Of the tyres made at the        
 Ballymena factory 50% of them are sold
 in the U.K. and the other 50% are     
 exported overseas.                    
   The factory is open seven days every
 week and the workers operate in       
 shifts.There are three shifts every   
 day 7.00a.m._3.00p.m.,3.00p.m._11.00pm
 and 11.00p.m._7.00a.m.                
    Every person works at least twenty 
 days in every four weeks.             
     The future prospects are          
 reasonably good but as with other     
 industries they depend on the economy 
 in general.                           </content>
