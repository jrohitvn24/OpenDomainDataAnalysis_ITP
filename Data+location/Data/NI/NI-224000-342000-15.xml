		<content>   During 190 yrs of exposure, the iron
 cramps which hold the stone blocks of 
 Castlecoole together have rusted.This 
 has resulted in corners of the blocks 
 being split away.In order to prevent  
 eventual decay of the building, the   
 National Trust has embarked on a      
 programme of dismantling the stone    
 blocks, row by row, removing the iron 
 cramps &amp; replacing the badly broken   
 stones &amp; rebuilding the walls.        
   Stainless steel rather than iron    
 cramps are being used. The original   
 quarry at Portland Bill, England, is  
 now closed but stone has been quarried
 near to it &amp; the texture &amp; colour as  
 closely matched to the original as    
 possible. The restoration is estimated
 to take approximately 10 years but it 
 will be worth the effort as           
 Castlecoole is one of the finest      
 buildings of its type in Europe.      </content>
