		<title>14THE SLUICE GATES ON THE ERNE</title>
		<content>     The Sluice Gates were built for   
 two reasons.                          
{(1)}The boat companies in Fermanagh   
 knew that{tourism}on the Upper and    
 Lower lough Erne was going to improve 
 greatly in the next few years.        
{(2)}The first Irish government wanted 
 to have electricity at{Ballyshannon.} 
   The Sluice Gates were a combined    
 effort of both the Irish and British  
 government.                           
    They regulate the supply of water  
 used at the{Hydro-electric station}in{
 Ballyshannon in the Irish Republic.   
    The Sluice Gates are hydraulically 
 operated and function 24 hours daily. 
    They may be manually operated in   
 the event of a power failure.         
    The gates are permanently attended 
 by an official of the Department of   
 Agriculture.
