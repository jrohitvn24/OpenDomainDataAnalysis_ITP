		<title>15White Horse Inn</title>
		<content> The White Horse Inn started off as two
 houses No. 39 and 41. The first bar   
 was the living room of No.39, then the
 sitting room became a lounge bar.  The
 first bar is now the Dart Room.  There
 was an alley at the rear which is now 
 the toilets. The large back yard was  
 converted into two more lounges.  One 
 of the lounges known as the Middle    
 Lounge is now a Dance Floor. At the   
 far end of No. 41 is now the kitchen  
 where the Pub Grub is cooked.         
 The upstairs has a flat and it is     
 where the owner and his family live.  
 No one knows exactly how old the Inn  
 is but it is estimated at over 200    
 years old.
