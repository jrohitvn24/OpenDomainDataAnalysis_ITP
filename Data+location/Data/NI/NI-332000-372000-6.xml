		<content> About 40% of the senior school (P4-7) 
 live near enough to school to be able 
 to walk each day,30% travel by bus,21%
 by car and the rest by bike.          
  In a survey,we found that well over  
 half the class lived in terraced      
 houses 1/5 in semi-detached,1/10 in   
 flats.Roughly one half of our homes   
 has a garden in which we can play.    
 Those who have no gardens play in the 
 street or the 'back enteries'-games of
 tig,hide and go seek,cops and robbers 
 are all popular,especially in shrub-  
 beries of the local parks,and football
  We usually get homework from school  
 every night,which NONE of us like     
 doing,but after that the time is spent
 doing the things WE like! Watching    
 television is a very popular pastime, 
 and 55% of the school has a video at  
 home. The most popular viewing is     
 films (especially Sci-Fi/Fantasy).    </content>
