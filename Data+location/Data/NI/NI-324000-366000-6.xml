		<content> Since this area is within a south-west
 to north-east running valley,and since
{Belfast}is so close,the dominant line 
 of communication is along the axis of 
 the valley.Through the south-east     
 corner of this "D-block" runs Northern
 Ireland's main{railway}line and the   
 main (A1) road to Lisburn and the     
 south and west.Both{road and rail     
 services are excellent since all rail 
 and many{bus}routes must use this way 
 down the valley to{Belfast}from many  
 parts of Northern Ireland.(And the    
 Republic of Ireland)                  
  Away from this axis the roads quickly
 become minor in nature and the only   
 other main route is that from{Lisburn}
 to the{airport at Aldergrove}and to   
 the north and west of the province.   
  A new road is being built up the     
 valley and will link north Lisburn    
 with the{Motorway(M1)}at Finaghy.     </content>
