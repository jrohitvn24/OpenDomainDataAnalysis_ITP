		<content> We have a television. It is a Hitachi.
 It has eight buttons but only six     
 stations. They are BBC 1,BBC          
 2,ITV,CHANNEL 4,RTE 1,RTE 2.          
 I like the programme The Centenary    
 Sunday Game,but it is not on any more 
 because this is 1985 and the centenary
 of the GAA was 1984. The GAA is short 
 for the Gaelic Athletic Association.It
 showed highlights of gaelic and       
 hurling matches.There are Quiz shows  
 on different stations.On BBC1 or 2    
 there are hardly any and I dont like  
 them. The best ones are on ITV        
 but my favorite is on RTE 1 called    
 Murphy's Micro Quiz-m.It is introduced
 by Mike Murphy.There is a lot of      
 computers on it and a big one which he
 calls Sylvester.There are computer    
 games where the contestants can win   
 prizes. Another Quiz game I like is   
 Family Fortunes.                      </content>
