		<title>12Band Parade</title>
		<content>  {Every year}in June a Band Parade is 
 held in Knockloughrim. It is held in  
 June for the long clear summer        
 evenings. This year the evening was   
 wet and cold. The{bands}came to{march 
 past the large{crowd.}The place was   
 full of spectators and hundreds of    
{pounds}were{collected}for Cancer      
 Research. Thirty five bands assembled 
 at the Orange Hall, and paraded       
{playing}through the village. The      
 Parade started at 20.30. My favourite 
 band was Annaghmore Flute. They wear  
 bright blue{uniforms}and beat big     
 drums so loudly that I could not hear 
 myself speak. It was exciting. I      
 followed them. There were many other  
{noisy}flute bands dressed in vivid    
 reds, blues and orange. The Parade    
 included other kinds of bands,        
 accordian, pipe, part-music flute and 
 brass.                                </content>
