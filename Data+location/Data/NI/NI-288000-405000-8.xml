		<content> THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FARMS ALL
 OVER THE WORLD. IN OUR AREA THE       
 MAIN TYPE OF FARMING IS               
 DAIRY FARMING WERE THEY KEEP COWS FOR 
 MILKING. THE COWS ARE MILKED BY       
 MILKING MACHINES IN LARGE SHEDS. THE  
 MILK IS KEPT IN STORAGE TANKS UNTIL   
 LIFTED BY A TANKER WHICH TAKES IT AWAY
 FOR DRINKING. SOME FARMS KEEP PIGS FOR
 PORK,SHEEP FOR WOOL AND HENS FOR EGGS.
 SOME FARMERS GROW BARLEY WHICH IS CUT 
 BY A MACHINE CALLED A COMBINE. THE    
 STRAW IT LEAVES BEHIND IS BALED BY A  
 BALER. THE WHEAT IS TAKEN IN BY A     
 TRAILER TO THE FARM. A SILAGE CUTTER  
 IS A MACHINE TOWED BY A TRACTOR WHICH 
 CUTS GRASS FOR SILAGE.THE SILAGE IS   
 STORED IN A PIT FOR THE COWS TO EAT   
 OVER WINTER.THE PLOUGH IS A SIMPLE    
 MACHINE WHICH TURNS THE GROUND OVER   
 FOR GROWING POTATOES.
