		<content> We did a table to find out what our   
 children lived in and what age of     
 building it was.The oldest home was   
 over one hundred years old.One boy    
 lived a council house,one in a caravan
 and one lived on church property.Eight
 children lived in two storied houses  
 and twenty one in bungalows.You can   
 not build a house or knock it down    
 whenever you like because you have to 
 get planning permission.Most bungalows
 are about 1000 square feet.There used 
 to be grant for building bungalows    
 but now there is not,although grants  
 are available for improvements,       
 insulation and repairs.Nowadays       
 bungalows are quite plain.They are    
 usually rectangular and have at least 
 one window in each room.In a typical  
 bungalow there are about 3 bedrooms,  
 a bathroom,a living room and a        
 kitchen.                              </content>
