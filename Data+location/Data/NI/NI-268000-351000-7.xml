		<content>  {Dairy farming is the production of  
{milk for human consumption. }Milking  
 is carried out twice a day.  Today    
 most people use large milking         
 machines.  The milk is sucked into    
 jars and when the jars are full the   
 valves are opened and the milk is     
 pumped into the milk storage tank.    
   The people with small herds only use
 the byre and a small portable milking 
 machine.  Most people have at least 20
 milking cows.  If farmers have large  
 herds of 70 or more cows they use a   
 Herring Bone milking parlour which    
 holds 16 or 18 cows with 8 or 9 up    
 each side.                            
   Some people only keep a cow and milk
 it by hand.  They get enough milk for 
 their family and enough to feed       
 a couple of calves.
