		<title>11NEWTOWNARDS - SETTING/TOWN</title>
		<content> Newtownards is situated at the head of
 Strangford Lough with hills to the    
 north, east and west of the town. The 
 rural area is divided into neat fields
 forming small farms where beef and    
 dairy cattle are raised. Some         
 vegetables are also grown to the south
 of the urban area. The urban area is  
 centred on Conway Square and around   
 this is the commercial part of the    
 town with shops and offices. Much of  
 the old housing is being redeveloped  
 and there are now many new housing    
 areas close to the town. Industry has 
 declined and factories have either    
 closed or been convewrted to other    
 uses. Architecturally the best        
 buildings are the churches. The       
 Northern Bank in Regent Street is a   
 good example of Italinate style and   
 the Bank of Ireland in Conway Square  
 is Neo-Classical.                     </content>
