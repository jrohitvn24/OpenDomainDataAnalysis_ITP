 market takes place in the market yard 
 off Rainey Street.On Tuesdays store   
 cattle are sold,  on Wednesdays beef  
 cattle and on Fridays there is a pig  
 market.Occasionally a sheep market is 
 held.The animals are brought to the   
 market in a trailer or lorry.These    
 animals are sold by auction and the   
 person who places the highest bid buys
 the beast.Some already fattened       
 animals are taken directly to the     
 abattoir .The market starts at        
 approximately 10.00am.Some farmers    
 leave their animals at the market in  
 the morning and allow the auctioneer  
 to sell them.Mr.William Gamble is the 
 owner of the market yard and          
 auctioneer.The farmers pay him a fee  
 for his services and the use of the   
 facilities.
