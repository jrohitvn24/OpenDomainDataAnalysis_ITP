		<content> Tig is a game that we sometimes play  
 at school.This is how you play it.The 
 person who is on the tig runs after   
 people to try to tip them and the     
 person that was tipped is now "on" and
 has to catch others.                  
   Rounders is a game where there are  
 two teams.One team is in batting the  
 other is fielding. If someone catches 
 the ball all the team of the person   
 who batted it is out and then that    
 team has to field and the other bats. 
   Cricket is a game like rounders     
 there is two teams and there is a     
 batting team and a fielding team and  
 if the ball hits the wickets you're   
 out and the other person after you is 
 in.                                   
   Hop-scotch is an old game that was  
 played along time ago and we have     
 recently started playing it again.
