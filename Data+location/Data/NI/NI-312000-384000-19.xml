 Antrim Arts Society was formed in the 
 1960's to foster and develop the love 
 of music,art,drama etc. in the town.  
 Since its inception it has been       
 responsible for introducing to the    
 people of the area many famous        
 singers,instrumentalists,instrumental 
 and operatic groups.                  
                                       
    Under the auspices of Antrim Arts  
 Society a mixed choir was formed in   
 1970.This has grown to over 60 members
 who enjoy meeting weekly to sing and  
 who also give much pleasure to        
 audiences from the town and district  
 through performances of both light and
 serious music e.g.Handel's Messiah and
 Haydn's Creation.
