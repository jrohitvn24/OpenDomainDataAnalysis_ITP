		<title>01Around Augher</title>
		<content> The village of Augher lies about 60   
 miles south west of Belfast, and      
 straddles the main road to            
 Enniskillen. It has a population of   
 around four hundred and fifty. The    
 chief source of employment is the     
 Aughen Creamery, where several        
 varieties of cheese are produced.     
 A feature of the village is a         
 seventeenth century castle,which      
 overlooks a picturesque lake. The     
 surrounding area is entirely devoted  
 to farming. Farms are small to medium 
 ranging in size from ten to thity     
 hectares.  Apart from forage, few     
 crops are grown, the emphasis being on
 milk and beef production.             
 The land rises form the Blackwater    
 which is a popular angling river.     
 The terrain is hilly, with a maze of  
 narrow twisting roads.
