		<content> In 1840 Gilford Mill was built. When  
 it was opened the population increased
 rapidly, so Dumbar and McMaster the   
 owners built three streets: Ann St.,  
 High St., and Hill St. People came    
 from Fermanagh, Monaghan and Armagh to
 work in Gilford Mill. So many people  
 from Keady lived in Hill St. that the 
 locals called it Keady Row. Even after
 it has been demolished people still   
 call it Keady Row. Many people died in
 the great famine between 1845 and     
 1850. To help the people who had the  
 fever, Dunbar and McMaster converted  
 two houses in Keady Row into a        
 hospital. Dr McBride was the doctor in
 the hospital. Keady Row was demolished
 but was rebuilt again. The old houses 
 were built of red brick which were    
 made in the brick yard which was to   
 the rear of Castle Hill. The          
 population of the area is about 6000. </content>
