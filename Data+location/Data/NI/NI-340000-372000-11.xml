 football pitch but it is now the site 
 for Dundonald International Ice Bowl. 
 The project involves a skating rink,  
 ten_pin bowling alley,restaurant,cafe 
 and a shop where sports equipment     
 will be sold and a multi_purpose      
 sports hall.The work is scheduled to  
 take 15 months.People should be ice   
 skating in the summer of 1986 and     
 bowling 9 months afterwards.70 acres  
 of land will be used for a spacious   
 car park, driving range, putting green
 and picnic area.The contract for      
 Dundonald International Ice Bowl will 
 cost Â£4.4 million.Castlereagh Council 
 are going ahead with their plan for   
 the Ice rink although there were some 
 arguments.They are also going ahead   
 without government grant aid,but the  
 facilities will be much appreciated by
 the ratepayers in the area.           </content>
