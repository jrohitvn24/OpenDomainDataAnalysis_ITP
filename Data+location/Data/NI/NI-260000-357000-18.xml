		<content> To-day we went to see a farm and to   
 find out more about it.A man showed us
 around the henhouse.The hens were kept
 in cages with about seven or eight in 
 each cage.In one house there are five 
 thousand six hundred hens.It takes one
 man about two and a half hours to     
 collect and clean the eggs.There are  
 between four to five hundred dozen    
 eggs every day.The hens are fed with  
 meal made from barley.He has 105 milk 
 cows and 30 calves.The heifer calves  
 are kept for cows and the bull calves 
 are sold.He can milk 12 cows at a time
 and a cow gives an average of 10      
 gallons of milk a day.He has 150 acres
 of land,4 tractors and lots of        
 machinery.Most other farms in the area
 are much smaller with less stock and  
 machinery.Many farmers only work      
 part-time on their farms.
