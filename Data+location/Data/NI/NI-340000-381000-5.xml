		<title>05A HISTORY OF ROCKPORT</title>
		<content>  In 1817 Rockport was built as a      
 private dwelling by John Turnly (1764 
 - 1841).When he died his son occupied 
 the house until the late 1850s when a 
 Captain May took over.The Mays        
 remained as occupants until 1906 when 
 a Geoffrey Bing bought the house and  
 set up Rockport Preparatory School, of
 which he was the first headmaster.In  
 1944 Mr Eric Tucker took over the     
 school and remained as head until 1974
 when he was succeeded by Mr John Agg  
 Large who , at the time of writing    
 ,has just announced his intention to  
 leave in July 1986.                   
  Rockport School began with only three
 pupils and now has about two hundred  
 so many alterations have had to be    
 made, over the years, to original     
 buildings.     (CONTINUED)
