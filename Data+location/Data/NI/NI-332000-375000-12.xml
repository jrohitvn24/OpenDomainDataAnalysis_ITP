		<content>                           We stopped  
 55 people and asked them              
 what they did in their spare time.    
 Every one of the 38 men and 17 women  
 watched TV.  The most popular channel 
 was ITV, the most popular type of     
 programme was films, but the single   
 favourite programme was "Dallas"      
 followed by "Coronation Street."      
 Next in popularity came {watching}    
 sport- done by 87% of men and 76% of  
 women.  The sport watched by most men 
 was snooker, followed by football and 
 boxing.  That watched by most women   
 was also snooker, with football second
 and swimming and tennis third.        
 (Although more men watched sport, only
 32% of them took part in any sport,   
 compared  with 53% of the women.  No  
 one sport stood out, although swimming
 came first for the women.)
