		<content> Our local police force is called the  
{Royal Ulster Constabulary.}In our area
 they are not faced with serious       
 security problems as else where.      
 Petty crime,theft,breaking and        
 entering and vandaliesm are the main  
 issues with which they have to deal in
 the local estates.                    
{Alcohol abuse}is becoming a major     
 worry in the Rathenraw estate and the 
 police are urgently forming contacts  
 with parents and licencees to curb the
 problem,especially among young people.
{Community police}now pace the beat in 
 the local estates to try and build up 
 favourable ties with the              
 residents.They also visit schools to  
 talk to the pupils.                   
 The{countryside}is essential quiet and
 is policed by car.Sheep worrying or   
 trespass do sometimes occur.
