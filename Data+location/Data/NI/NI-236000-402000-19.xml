		<content> THE MAIN PROBLEM HERE IS UNEMPLOYMENT.
 YOUNG AND OLD ARE AFFECTED AND MANY   
 LEAVE IN SEARCH OF WORK AS FAR AWAY AS
 CANADA AND AUSTRALIA.EVEN WITH HIGH   
 PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS OPENINGS  
 IN EMPLOYMENT ARE GROWING LESS.THE    
 ONLY SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IN THE  
 CLOUGHCOR OF 1985 IS THE SAME AS IT   
 WAS IN 1885--EMIGRATION.THE AREA IS   
 RICH AND FERTILE BUT UNABLE TO KEEP   
 ITS INHABITANTS.THE CHIEF SOURCE OF   
 WEALTH,THE LAND,IS OWNED BY THE FEW   
 AND MODERN FARM TECHNOLOGY HAS REDUCED
 THE NUMBER OF LABOURERS.THERE IS NO   
 FUTURE IN OUR BEAUTIFUL LAND FOR US.  
 THERE ARE NEITHER AMENITIES NOR GRANTS
 TO TEMPT US TO STAY.FARMS GET BIGGER  
 AND MORE MECHANISED,RURAL POPULATIONS 
 DECLINE IN NUMBER,YOUNG FAMILIES DRIFT
 TO THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF THE URBAN     
 CENTRES AND THE SLUM AREAS IN THE CITY
 GROW INCREASINGLY LARGER.             </content>
