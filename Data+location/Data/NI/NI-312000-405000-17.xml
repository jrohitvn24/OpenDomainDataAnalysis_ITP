		<title>17FARMING</title>
		<content>   The land in and around Broughshane  
 consists of a number of small farms.  
 Many of the farms involve themselves  
 in a mixture of farming comprising    
 dairy, beef,pig,sheep,arable and      
 chicken farming.                      
   Many types of farming are carried on
 in the Broughshane area and no        
 particular type is dominant,although  
 beef and dairy farming are popular.In 
 the case of the dairy farming,the     
 cattle are milked early in the morning
 and again in the evening.This milk is 
 then stored in tanks and collected by 
 a tanker,which transports it to the   
 dairy at{Dromona},where it is changed 
 into such dairy products as butter and
 cheese.                               
   Other types of farming include      
 arable farming where such crops as    
 potatoes and wheat are grown.Many     
 farms also keep pigs and chickens.    </content>
