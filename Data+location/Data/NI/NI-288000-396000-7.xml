		<content> About seventy million years ago there 
 were{volcanoes}near our district.     
 There were many{lava}flows.A flow came
 in our direction and cooled to{basalt.
 This rock is strong under compression 
 and was used as{building stone}for the
 early buildings in our village. The   
 rock is taken from{quarries.}The rock 
 face is{bored}with a pneumatic drill, 
 charged with gelignite{explosive}and  
 detonated into broken boulders. These 
 are drawn by giant dumper lorries     
 to a{crusher,}on to a cone granulator,
 on to a vibrating screen to be graded 
 according to their{size}and directed  
 to separate stock piles. When heated  
 and mixed with hot bitumen,{tar       
{macadam}is made for road surfacing and
 repairs. The smaller stone is used for
{concrete products:}building blocks,   
 kerbs, paving slabs, window sills,    
 drinking troughs, concrete lintels....</content>
