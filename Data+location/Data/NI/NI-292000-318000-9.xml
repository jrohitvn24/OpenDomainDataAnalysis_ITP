		<content> When a person dies, a "wake" is held  
 for 2 successive nights after death,  
 when all the neighbours,friends and   
 relatives come to visit the home,     
 sympathise with the bereaved and pray 
 for the deceased.Clocks are stopped   
 when a person dies and mirrors are    
 covered with a white cloth.Those who  
 live close by, discontinue all work as
 a mark of respect.If a person dies in 
 hospital,his remains must not be      
 brought home past the church.When the 
 coffin is carried out of the house, it
 is placed on two chairs for a moment  
 and then lifted again.The chairs are  
 then turned upside down.Neighbours dig
 the grave as it is not considered     
 fitting for a relation of the deceased
 to do this.The pall bearers are always
 related to the deceased,e.g.son,      
 brother,nephew.If not related,they    
 usually bear the same surname.        </content>
