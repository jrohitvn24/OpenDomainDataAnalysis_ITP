   There are many different religions  
 represented in Cookstown.Presbyterian,
 Plymouth Brethern,Free Methodist,Free 
 Presbyterian,Roman Catholic and       
 Jehova's Witness.The main differences 
 are between Protestants and Roman     
 Catholics.The Catholics worship in a  
 chapel and worship many different     
 things than Protestants.Last week the 
 Catholics had a Holy Week when they   
 had stalls outside the chapel selling 
 Rosary beeds.                         
   Relationships between Catholics and 
 Protestants are often a source of     
 problems.While personal relationships 
 are usually very good,tensions between
 groups are often strained especially  
 during the "marching season"of July   
 and August.This is when each commumity
 seems compelled to express basic      
 territorial claims.                   </content>
