		<title>09Employment in Ballywalter</title>
		<content>    Many years ago most of the         
 villagers were brought up around the  
 harbour - my dad and his dad before   
 him. Fishing has not changed a great  
 deal although the coming of outboard  
 engines changed it a bit. We still    
 catch winkles and edible crabs around 
 the harbour and cod and whiting       
 farther out.                          
    Fishing out of Ballywalter has     
 almost died out. Only a couple of     
 retired men try to earn a living. Now 
 most men go to Portavogie, the centre 
 of the fishing industry in the Ards   
 Peninsula.                            
    Boats used to come into the harbour
 carrying coal and that gave a lot of  
 employment. Now the coal comes to     
 Bangor.                               
    At one time there were also boats  
 which brought in lime to be burnt. It 
 was used to build walls.              </content>
