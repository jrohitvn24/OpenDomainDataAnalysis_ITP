		<title>01   Tandragee's Motto</title>
		<content>        The town's motto is            
                                       
      {"TANDRAGEE NO PINCH"}           
                                       
  This dates back to the 18th and 19th 
 centuries when, owing to the wise and 
 kindly management of the proprietory  
 landlords at the castle, first the    
 Sparrow family and secondly the       
 Manchesters, there was 'full and      
 plenty' for all and no pinching or    
 saving.                               
  Later some wag enlarged the slogan to
 read {'Tandragee no pinch, all water  
{and no milk'}.At that time the town   
 had a great flax and general market as
 well as important fairs, and the great
 stir of commerce was only matched by  
 lavish hospitality with 'no pinch' in 
 the availability of refreshments or to
 use the idiom of the time, there was  
 'lashins and lavins'.                 </content>
