		<title>13GREENAN GRAVEYARD</title>
		<content> The Greenan Graveyard, known as       
 "{Clonea}" is situated along the      
 Greenan Rd.  It was used for the      
 celebration of mass until the end of  
 the l8th century.  For many years the 
 ground remained unconsecrated but was 
 finally consecrated by the late Dr    
 Bishop Mulhern.  There are 3 large    
 granite crosses in the centre of the  
 Graveyard.  The most recent one was   
 erected in memory of the late Mr      
 Mooney of Castlewellan who was the    
 first Catholic landlord in this part  
 of the country.  The Graveyard is     
 known to contain the remains of 4     
 still born babies, an old woman, a boy
 who drowned in a nearby lake and some 
 people who committed suicide.  One of 
 the stone crosses marks the spot where
 the bodies were laid.                 
 It is now under the control of the    
 Newry and Mourne District Council.    </content>
