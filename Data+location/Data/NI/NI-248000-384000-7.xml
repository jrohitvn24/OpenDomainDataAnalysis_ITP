		<title>07        SHEEP FARMING</title>
		<content>                                       
 Most of the farmers in our area have  
 sheep.Most of the time the sheep are  
 kept in the fields but some of the    
 farmers take the sheep into sheep     
 houses.The sheep houses need to be    
 quite open so lots of air can get in  
 at the sheep.If the sheep did not get 
 enough air they would catch           
 diseases.When the sheep have had their
 lambs they are let out to the field to
 graze.They are also given nuts or     
 meal.                                 
    At about the end of June the lambs 
 are sold.Each lamb costs about thirty 
 three pounds.At about the middle of   
 June the sheep are{sheared}some       
 people use electric shears but hand   
 shears are still used on small farms.
