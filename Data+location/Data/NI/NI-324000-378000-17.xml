		<title>17TRANSPORT IN BALLYUTOAG</title>
		<content>  Most of the houses and farms in the  
 area had at least one means of        
 transport. Every house had at least   
 one car and all of the farms had      
 tractors and other types of farm      
 machinery eg balers, muck spreaders   
 and trailers. Some of the makes of    
 tractors were Massey Ferguson, David  
 Brown and Ford.                       
  One bus route just skirts the area   
 and a private bus is available in the 
 mornings to take children to school.  
 Apart from this their is no public    
 transport in the area.                
  A minister who we interviewed stated 
 that he lived in the area because it  
 was close to the airport (about 6     
 miles away) and he found this         
 convenient as he was often going      
 abroad on missionary work.
