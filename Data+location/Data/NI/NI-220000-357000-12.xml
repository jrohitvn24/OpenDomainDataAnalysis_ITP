		<content> In Irvinestown there are four churches
 Methodist,Presbyterian,the Church of  
 Ireland and Sacred Heart church which 
 is the Roman Catholic chapel.I go to  
 the Church of Ireland which is up     
 Church Street.At 10.30am on Sunday we 
 have Sunday School for the children   
 who havn't been confirmed.Confirmation
 means that you make promises to God,  
 once confirmed you can take communion.
 Morning service in the church starts  
 at 11.30am with hymns and prayers.The 
 minister reads the announcements and  
 preaches the sermon and the collection
 is taken up when we are singing the   
 last hymn.Most subscribers put their  
 offering in envelopes.At the communion
 service people come to the front of   
 the church to have some wine and bread
 to remember the death of Jesus Christ.
 Special services are held at Christmas
 during Lent,Easter and Harvest.       </content>
