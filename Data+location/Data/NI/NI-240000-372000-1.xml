		<title>01SUMMARY OF OUR BLOCK</title>
		<content> SUMMARY OF AREA AS A WHOLE (CLAIRE,1  
 PAGE)                                 
                                       
    Most of the land in our block is   
 used for farming, except for the      
 eastern part which is built up. The   
 Derry Road is probably the most       
 important part of the block because   
 that is where all the industry is     
 situated. On the Derry Road we find   
 Nestles factory, Gortrush Industrial  
 Estate and a cinema with two          
 studios.In our area we have Conywarren
 children's home.In the western side of
 the block we have a small hamlet      
 called Gillygooly.There are quite a   
 few crossroads in our block and our   
 school is just beside one.To the north
 of our block is a small river called  
 the Fairy Water.The Fairy Water runs  
 for about 1 km from the northern      
 border of our block.                  </content>
