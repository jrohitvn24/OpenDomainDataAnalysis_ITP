		<content>    Approximately 200 boats are issued 
 with licenses each year by the Toome  
 Eel Fishery Company. This Company owns
 sole rights to eel-fishing on Lough   
 Neagh. The eels they fish for are     
 Brown Eels which have travelled all   
 the way from the Saragossa Sea.       
    Some 500-600 tonnes of Brown Eels  
 are caught each year.                 
    The method used by the fishermen is
 known as "long-line". These lines are 
 usually set in the evening and lifted 
 in the morning, The lines are often 4 
 to 5 miles long with 600-8-- hooks    
 attached. The bait is usually         
 worm, small perch or sections of      
 pollen (a local fish). The eels are   
 exported alive, iced in small         
 polythene bags. Holland takes 70% to  
 80% and the rest go to Germany and    
 London.
