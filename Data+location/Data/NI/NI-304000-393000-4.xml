		<content> The milk is stored in a 1500 litre    
 tank,and a compressor,which makes ice,
 cools the milk to 37 degrees C. before
 it is collected 3 hours later.        
 Mr.McNeilly's system for feeding has  
 recently become computerised so that  
 the cows can be given a certain amount
 of nuts at the press of a button.This 
 eases the burden of dispensing the 100
 tons of nuts which are needed each    
 year,but there is still much hard work
 to be done elsewhere eg.bringing in   
 the 1000 bales of hay needed to       
 sustain the cows over the winter.     
  This year the weather has been very  
 bad,with persistent rainfall and      
 little sunshine,which has meant low   
 yields for all crops grown in the     
 fields.Because of this, winter feed   
 will be scarce and Mr.McNeilly        
 believes that his milk profits this   
 year are bound to suffer.             </content>
