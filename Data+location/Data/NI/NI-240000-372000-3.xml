 secondary. There are three marks :A,M 
 and G. Mark A means that you are      
 suited to grammar school. Mark M means
 that you may be suited to a grammar   
 school. Finally mark G means that you 
 are best suited to a secondary school.
      When I get to school I hang up my
 coat and talk to my friends until the 
 bell for classes rings.We then go into
 the classroom and sit down. Our       
 teacher is called Mr. Gallagher, he is
 sometimes cross. Our school subjects  
 are History,  Mathematics, Sewing, Art
 and Craft, English, P.E., Science,    
 Religion, Geography and Swimming. At  
 breaktime, which is at 10.40, we go to
 the tuck shop. The tuck shop sells    
 crisps and sweets.                    
     Then we do our work until         
 dinnertime which is at 12.05.         </content>
