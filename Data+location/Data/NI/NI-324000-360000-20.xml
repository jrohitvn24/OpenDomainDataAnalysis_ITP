		<title>20SIR ROBERT HART'S TESTIMONY</title>
		<content>   Sir Robert Hart' s  Testimony       
                                       
 Sir Robrt Hart's father brought Linen 
 weaving to the locality and this was  
 the origin of the village settlement. 
                                       
 "It is my desire to live to God.  But 
 I can with the Royal Poet bless God   
 for all his goodness to me.           
 I know Christ to be my Savior and I   
 can without hesitation rely on his    
 merits for Salvation.  May I make the 
 most of my time.  May I be blessed    
 myself and be a blessing to others.   
 May i be sanctified and fitted for    
 Heaven.  Grant that I may be found    
 ready, watching and prepared for my   
 master's coming."                     
 Let us not all become materialists    
 because we become users of computers  
 remember mans chief destiny, JESUS    
 CHRIST IS THE ONLY HOPE FOR THIS WORLD</content>
