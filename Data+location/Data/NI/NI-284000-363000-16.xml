		<content> GHOST STORIES : This is an area where 
 ghost stories abound- from tales of   
 headless bodies in the moss to large  
 black hounds which accompany people on
 their journeys along the hedges, dark 
 LOANINS (lanes) at night- even        
 bringing priests to dying men and     
 disappearing at their doors. Banshees,
 haunted houses and bodies rising from 
 the grave are the subject of many     
 conversations.                        
 CHARMS : Many people go to local men  
 or women to obtain CHARMS for their   
 ills from VERUCCAS and WARTS to       
 SPRAINS and ECZEMA. It may mean       
 cutting potatoes and burying them in  
 the garden or gathering snails and    
 rubbing them on your skin. But people 
 believe and when they do they are     
 invariably cured when all other       
 medicine has failed.
