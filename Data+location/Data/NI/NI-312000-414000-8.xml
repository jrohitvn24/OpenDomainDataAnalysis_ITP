		<content> As I go round the farm I have many    
{different smells}.But there is one    
 smell which brings back{a memory}.It  
 is in{the Stable}.When I go in I see  
 little bits of straw lying on the     
 floor.As I walk up to the corner there
 is a manger.I would sit down on a     
 potato box.I would cast back my memory
 to the time when it was{coming near   
{Christmas}and our family was going to 
 my granny's.As we passed Granahan     
 Chapel we decided to go in to see the 
 Crib.As we walked up the aisle we took
 a seat and prayed to God for twenty   
 minutes.Then we went up to{the Crib   
 and saw the{cow, lamb and donkey.}We  
 saw{Mary and Joseph}kneeling round the
 manger where the{baby Jesus lies}.Then
 the{three wise Kings,}kneeling around 
 the crib holding{Myrh, Gold and       
{Frankincense}.Now I look back and     
 thank God for Christmas.              </content>
