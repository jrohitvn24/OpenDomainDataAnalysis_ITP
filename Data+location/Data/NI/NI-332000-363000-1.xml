		<content> A rural area of low hills containing a
 predominance of lineated settlement   
 along the main roads which serve the  
 block area.   One village of          
 population approximately 400.   Small 
 fields are common with hedges of ash  
 and hawthorn.   The main industry is  
 farming with livestock dominating e.g.
 beef and store cattle.   Only one     
 small manufacturing plant employing 20
 workers is located in the area.   Two 
 small primary schools serve the       
 community, with members declining     
 their future is uncertain.            
 Occasional areas of woodland occur,   
 mainly of beech, but they do not      
 dominate any area of the drumlin      
 countryside.   Recent housing of the  
 executive bracket is located around   
 the village of Drumbo.   These would  
 represent commuter dwellings for      
 Belfast business people.              </content>
