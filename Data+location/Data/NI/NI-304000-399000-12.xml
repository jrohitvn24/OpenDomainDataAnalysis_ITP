 local, but based on the future of the 
 Province; the{Unionist-Nationalist    
 standpoints and the answer to the     
 present 'troubles'. This area is      
 strongly protestant and has mainly    
 elected candidates who will preserve  
 the Union.                            
{ In this election there where 6 seats 
{in the Maine ward. 5 went to the      
{Democratic Unionist Party and the     
{other to an Offical Unionist.         
  The DUP who control the council, were
 founded and are led by the{Rev.Ian    
{Paisley}who also leads the Free Pres. 
 Church and is an M.P.for the N.Antrim 
 area at the Westminster and European  
 Parliaments,and N.I.Assembly.The mayor
