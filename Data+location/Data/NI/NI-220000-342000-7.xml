		<title>07FARMING IN ENNISKILLEN</title>
		<content>    Farming in this area,like most     
 of N. Ireland,is intensive.The most   
 common feature is grassland.          
     Dairy farming is very popular.The 
 climate is particularly suited to     
 this.The main asset to this is the    
 long growing season of seven months.  
 Beef cattle have always been popular  
 here,mainly because of the abundance  
 of grass. The cattle are usually      
 imported from S.Ireland and fattened  
 here.Recently young lightweight cattle
 of high quality have been produced.   
 This is encouraged by high prices     
 from the abbatoir for graded cattle.  
 They are killed and then examined for 
 fat and lean meat.The carcase is then 
 graded and the farmer receives the    
 cheque four days later.The price for  
 different grades can be as much as    
 thirty pence per kilo deadweight.An   
 incentive for efficient farming.      </content>
