 coniferous vegetation, used for farmng
 and recreational purposes. Moneyscalp 
 wood is easily accessible by a main   
 road and nearby is the mountain       
 centre and farming works. Sheep       
 farming on this fertile soil is more  
 common than arable farming and the    
 land is surrounded by conifers.
