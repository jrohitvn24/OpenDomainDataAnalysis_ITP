		<content>       In our area when someone dies{a 
{wake}is held.  All the{neighbours}call
 at the home of the dead person to     
 convey their sorrow to the rest of the
 family.  The dead person is 'laid     
 out' either in a coffin or on a bed.  
 Candles are kept lit all the time the 
 dead body is in the house.  Mirrors in
 the room are covered.  Someone,       
 usually a relative, sits in the room  
 where the corpse is all during the    
 wake.  People who call are brought    
 first to the room where the person is 
 'laid out' and it is customary for    
 callers to touch the dead person.     
       The person who calls is given   
 tea made by very close neighbours.  At
 some wakes drink and cigarettes are   
 also given out.  Neighbours also sit  
 up all night when the 'remains' are in
 the home.                             
                                       </content>
