		<content> This area in the North of the block is
 an RAF Station and Firing Range.      
 Access is restricted to Service       
 personnel. Apart from the obvious     
 interference due to the functioning of
 the ranges, the wildlife is           
 effectively protected and therefore   
 thrives. Some of the higher areas of  
 dunes are severely eroded but only in 
 small areas. The site is home to a    
 large number of service families but  
 most would not tend to use the area   
 for recreation with the exception of a
 few fishermen on the edge of the      
 channel.                              
 The area was formed at the same time  
 as, and in much the same fashion as   
 Murlough. Much less research has been 
 done, however, as a result of the     
 access restrictions.
