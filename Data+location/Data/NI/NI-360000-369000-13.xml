		<title>13Ballywalter - Population</title>
		<content>    Ballywalter began about 350 years  
 ago but very few people lived here.   
 Now there are about 1,000 people in   
 Ballywalter but it is not increasing  
 much. This is because a lot are going 
 to towns because of the jobs and poor 
 bus services.                         
    Now there are not so many people   
 living in the country because there   
 are not many jobs and you have to     
 travel a long way to get food and     
 other things.                         
    Some farms are becoming bigger as  
 farmers buy small farms near them.    
 They use machinery to do most of the  
 work. If there was more work more     
 people would stay.                    
    There are not many middle class    
 homes because of lack of jobs. One man
 is building houses up the Dunover Road
 but he is finding them hard to sell.
