		<title>10LOCAL  HISTORY  DONAGHADEE</title>
		<content> Before 1600 Donaghadee was little more
 than a small natural harbour close to 
 Scotland. When Hugh Montgomery began  
 his unofficial{PLANTATION}of the{ARDS}
 in 1610 he chose D'Dee as his port.   
                                       
 For the next 250 years the town was   
 the chief port in the northern part of
 Ireland and the Irish end of the {    
{SHORT SEA PASSAGE} to &amp; from Scotland.
 In 1819{JOHN RENNIE}began building one
 of his greatest works - Donaghadee    
 Harbour. This was completed in 1834 - 
 but was already doomed. Steam had     
 arrived and the new harbour was soon  
 found to be too small for the larger  
 steam ships. The ferries went to the  
 Larne - Stranraer route. Donaghadee   
 gave up its national fame and reverted
 to its former quiet role as a pleasant
 harbour for small pleasure craft.
