		<content> Corndale Kennels,{Cattery}and{Livery  
 is owned and run by Mark McFeeley.  He
 is helped by Fiona Sands, a stable    
 girl and riding instuctress.  All     
 sorts of people come here.  The horses
 are the main attraction.  Fiona       
 teaches novices to ride, and Mark     
 takes the more experienced riders on  
 hacks about the countryside.          
 Horses may be kept at the stables.    
 They are cared for like Marks own     
 horses but the owners obviously have  
 to pay for their keep.                
 Mark rode in 1978 for the{Junior      
{Ireland team,}and secured fourth      
 place.                                
 Mark's pony, Shelta is now twenty but 
 when she was younger she jumped for   
 Ireland, and came second.             
 In the kennels all breeds of dogs are 
 kept and they are given the best daily
 care and attention.                   </content>
