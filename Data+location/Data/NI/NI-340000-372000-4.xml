		<title>04At Hospital in Dundonald</title>
		<content> I fell in school one day and had to go
 to hospital to have stitches.At the   
 information desk I was asked several  
 questions and given a tag incase I had
 to go back.I went into the waiting    
 room and talked to a kind old lady who
 comforted me.Then I heard my name     
 being called on a loud speaker asking 
 me to go to Dr.Graham's room just down
 the corridor.The doctor looked at my  
 knee and said that there was a stone  
 in it and I needed stitches.I lay on  
 the bed while he pulled out the stone 
 with large tweezers and then he       
 stitched the cut with a large curved  
 needle.He said I would not need an    
 injection. When I went back to my own 
 doctor he took out my stitches and    
 said all would be well.In a week or so
 my knee was completely healed.
