		<content> The Ballynahinch River is the centre  
 of our community.It has several names 
 and it's source is Lough Aughery near 
 Dromara.The river runs mills in our   
 area.One of the working mills is      
 called Mary Brooke House.Now the river
 is used for fishing and a canoeing    
 club also canoe on the river at       
 Drumaghlis.On the 20th of May         
 1973 the Drumaghlis part              
 of the river flooded very badly.The   
 bridge was broken and the road was    
 blocked for quite a while.The bridge  
 was rebuilt and is now used a lot     
 every day.The river itself is full    
 of plants and there is quite a lot of 
 wildlife.There are a lot of fish and  
 frogs around and in the river.The     
 river also has lots of reeds which    
 sometimes grow quite high.
