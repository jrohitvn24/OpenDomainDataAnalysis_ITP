		<content> There are no tourist facilities such  
 as Hotels or Guest Houses. However,   
 there are two restaurants - the Sara  
 Moon on Whinny Hill and The Pot Belly 
 at Tullylish.                         
 Visitors to the area usually come for 
 fishing on the river or to the lakes  
 in the district.                      
 A shell garden on Stramore Road has   
 been made by a Mr Milligan. He        
 obtained the shells from the shores at
 Laytown and Bellystown in Co. Neath.  
 Each summer the garden is open to the 
 public and the admission proceeds are 
 given to different charities.         
 An annual horse jumping competition   
 has been held for the past three years
 in the grounds of Gilford Castle.     
 A summer camp for children is         
 organised by the Society of Friends,  
 Moyallan.
