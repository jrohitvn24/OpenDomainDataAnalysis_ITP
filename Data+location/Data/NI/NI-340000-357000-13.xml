		<title>13WAY OF LIFE IN SAINTFIELD</title>
		<content>   We sent out 100 survey forms for the
 children of this school to give to    
 their parents,and of these,80 were    
 returned.We used the survey forms to  
 find out about how people here live.  
   We found that 15 families(19%) have 
 children under school age.Thirty seven
 mothers-almost half-have paid         
 employment.Eight of these(10%) work   
 full time,while the rest have         
 part-time employment.As so many       
 mothers work,we think that this is why
 such high percentages have luxury     
 goods.We found that 16 families(20%)  
 have a dishwasher,28(35%) have a video
 recorder,12(15%) own a microwave oven,
 and 24(30%) a computer.Families having
 children in P6/7 seemed mainly to be  
 the families with computers,as these  
 children can use them properly.
