		<content> The employment in Carrowdore is enough
 for the amount of people who live in  
 the area.  The quarry employs at least
 15 people, Carrowcon approximately 40 
 and the shops, Post Office and public 
 house employ approximately 20 people. 
 The School employs 6 teachers, 4      
 dinner ladies, 1 secretary and 1      
 caretaker.                            
 Some people travel to Belfast or      
 Newtownards to their jobs and these   
 people are mostly employed by the     
 Government or are self-emmployed.     
 These people would travel to work by  
 car as the bus service is very poor   
 and there is no railway station near  
 the village.
