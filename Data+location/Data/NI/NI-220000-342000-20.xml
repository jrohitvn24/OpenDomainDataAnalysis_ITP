		<title>20THE"TROUBLES" IN ENNISKILLEN</title>
		<content>         The area covered by the block 
 is dominated by the urban area of     
 Enniskillen.The town has had its fair 
 share of trouble since the{"Troubles"}
 began in the late 1960's.The Tax      
 Office, the Library,the main street,  
 the Forum,and other places have all   
 been bombed at different times.       
 Rebuilding has given the main street a
 modern appearance.But at night the    
 town centre is virtually a ghost town.
 The main{shopping area}is closed to   
 traffic from 6-30pm until 8-30am,from 
 the East bridge as far as the two main
 churches.During the day vehicles have 
 to pass through a security checkpoint 
 to get up the main street.Most night  
 life is to be found to the east rather
 than the west of the area.Any pubs or 
 cafes in the main part of the town    
 have suffered badly because of the    
 troubles and the recession.           </content>
