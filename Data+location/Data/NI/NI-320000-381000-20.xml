		<title>20WATER WHEEL AND GOOD-BYE</title>
		<content> water wheels are the only relics of an
 industrious past on the Clady River.  
  The water wheel is at present in full
 working order,due entirely to the     
 efforts of Mr.Scott and his family,who
 have maintained the wheel and indeed  
 use it,to provide electricity in their
 home.                                 
             {GOOD_BYE                 
 Good_bye from the children of 1985,   
 In 100 yrs from now we won't be alive.
 We hope we live on in this Disk we    
  have made,                           
 And thoughts of Loanends will never   
  ever fade.                           
                                       
{WE HAVE RECORDED OUR PAST,OUR PRESENT 
{AND THUS YOUR PAST.                   
{PLEASE LOOK AFTER YOUR FUTURE!
