		<content> Most of the housing programme in this 
 area is either private development or 
 carried out by the Northern Ireland   
 Housing Executive.We have a number of 
 housing estates, Prince Andrew Terrace
 being the oldest, which has twelve    
 houses, six built in 1952 and the rest
 in 1960.In 1964 the Housing Executive 
 erected six more at Erne Terrace.Three
 years later a housing estate was      
 developed at Knockmore Park.Here, 12  
 houses were built in 1973 and 22 more 
 houses were erected at Fairview Park.A
 further 49 houses were completed in   
 1976 and 16 houses were provided in   
 1983 at Mill Green.Many householders  
 lately have been availing of          
 Government grants for housing         
 renovations.
