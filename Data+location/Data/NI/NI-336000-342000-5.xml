		<title>05Transport around Drumaroad</title>
		<content> The main route through our block is a 
 secondary road and is a{bus route}from
 Burns' Corner in the south(Map Ref.   
 0337 0342)to Draper Hill entrance gate
 in the north(0337 0345).Two parallel  
 tertiary roads run from south-east to 
 north-west and lead to Dromara from   
 Dundrum and Seaforde. Most households 
 have their own{car}in which to travel 
 to town. About 30% of pupils attending
{Drumaroad School}arrive by car and 25%
 in the Education Board minibus. The   
 remainder walk. Most{farmers}need cars
 as services are distant.{Landrovers}  
 pull trailers and transport animals   
 around.{Tractors}and trailers carry   
 fertilisers to fields and silage home 
 at harvest-time. School buses leave   
 the main road to run secondary pupils 
 from Drumaroad to Castlewellan.{Bikes}
 are few as it is hilly. The only{pony 
{and trap}is in the Demesne Road.      </content>
