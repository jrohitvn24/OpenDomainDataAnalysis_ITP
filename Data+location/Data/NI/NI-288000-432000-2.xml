{HISTORY                               
  Ballyrashane Dairy Society was       
 established in {1896}&amp; was the {first}
 creamery in Ireland to collect milk by
{tanker}direct from the farm,within an{
{eighty}km radius.In {1970}a decision  
 was taken to handle only bulk milk.In 
{1980}1.5 million gallons of milk were 
 sold in the liquid form,0.25 million  
 gallons were diverted to other centres
 for a variety of uses &amp; the rest was  
 separated into{cream &amp; skimmed milk. }
 There is a large demand for liquid    
 skim for animal feeding,this amounts  
 to{16,000}gallons per day.            
   Ballyrashane was the first factory  
 to have a mechanically operated butter
 packer installed in Northern Ireland.
