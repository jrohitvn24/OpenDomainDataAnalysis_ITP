		<title>07Kilnock Garden Centre R/town</title>
		<content> The major source of income in the area
 is obviously farming. However,several 
 small buisnesses not related to       
 agriculture have recently been set up.
                                       
  At Kilnock Cottage on the Roguery    
 Road a{GARDEN CENTRE}has been started,
 using a pre-fabricated building as    
 it's showroom. Almost everything      
 related to gardening can be bought ,  
 from seeds to sheds and from          
 fertilizers to furnture. The manager  
 told us that the best time of the year
 for sales is spring and early summer  
 when plants and gardening tools are   
 most popular. At the moment buisness  
 is very good,and it is hoped that in  
 the near future a more permanent      
 building will be erected and grounds  
 expanded.
