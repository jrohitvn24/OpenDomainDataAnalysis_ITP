 shortly after rising.For most it      
 consists of a cereal Corn Flakes,Sugar
 Puffs followed by a cup of tea and    
 perhaps a slice or two of toast.There 
 are other variations _porridge,boiled 
 eggs,a fry etc but cereal tea and     
 toast are most popular.At sometime    
 between 12.30 and 2.30p.m.most people 
 stop for lunch.For some it means a    
 snack of a few sandwiches with tea
