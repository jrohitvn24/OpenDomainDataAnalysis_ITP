 MANY GAMES.                           
  {                                    
{                                      
{ HIDE AND SEEK: }                     
 The game is for three or more people. 
 First  of all you have to find a      
 place where the person counts .When   
 you have done that you say a rhyme    
 like:"one,two, sky blue all out       
 but you."That person is on and        
 becomes the catcher.We usually pick   
 the number 150 and the person who is  
 on counts this out.When he is counting
 we all run somewhere and hide.When the
 person has finished counting he looks 
 to see if he can find anybody.If the  
 catcher walks past somebody then the  
 person goes to den and says he is     
 free!If some body is caught then that 
 person is on next game.
