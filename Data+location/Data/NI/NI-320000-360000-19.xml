		<title>19MAZE HORSEBREEDER</title>
		<content> The Clendenning family live on Bog    
 Road,Maze.They own a cottage dwelling,
 extensive outbuildings and some       
 surrounding land.                     
{Horse Breeding }is Mr.Clendenning's   
 main interest and people travel from  
 far and wide to purchase his ponies.He
 specialises in ponies suitable for    
 children but also breeds horses for   
 jumping.He renovates {carts }and has  
 some very decorative ones for sale.   
 Such is his interest that he is       
 organising a horse and cart parade    
 down the Halftown Road on the 30th of 
 June 1985.Running such a farm is a    
 very costly business and the family   
 sell a wide variety of other          
 commodities to supplement their       
 income.Items such as tack and         
 household goods are on sale.
