		<content> The Southern and South Eastern part of
 the block (south of the mountain      
 watershed marked by the Mourne Wall   
 drains southwards into the Ben Crom   
 and Silent Valley reservoirs.         
 Turbary, the cutting of upland peat   
 for fuel is not practised in this     
 block. (The area immediately South of 
 Fofanny Reservoir used to be cut and  
 the cuttings can still be seen.       
 Cutting was stopped to reduce sedim-  
 entation in the reservoir.)           
 Forestry is restricted to two small   
 plantations. On the North-western side
 of Fofanny reservoir, a stand of Larch
 and other conifers is almost fully    
 grown. On a drained area of wet       
 moorland at 290297 the Forestry       
 Division planted Corsican Pine which  
 are now about 10 years old.
