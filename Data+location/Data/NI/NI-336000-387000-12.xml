		<title>12BULLS IN CARRICKFERGUS.</title>
		<content> In grid reference 0338,0387; is a     
 forty acres farm owned by the Barron  
 family who specialise in breeding     
 prize bulls and heifers.  On a show   
 day the family rise at 4.00 a.m. to   
 bring in and feed the cattle.  The    
 show bulls are loaded into a trailer  
 and taken to the show, where they are 
 washed, brushed and given a blow dry  
 with a hair drier. A collar with a    
 number is put round the bull's neck   
 and the bull is taken to the show ring
 where 8 or 9 bulls are paraded at a   
 time, until the judging is complete.  
 The bulls are shown from age of 10    
 months up to 2 year old.  Their       
 training starts from the time they are
 4 weeks old and when they are 2 years 
 they are sold to other breeders for   
 stud or for beef.
