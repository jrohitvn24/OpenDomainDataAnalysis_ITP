		<content>    Quite a number  of new  houses have
 been built in recent years  and others
 have been modernised . New  houses are
 mostly  of   the  bungalow   type  and
 although often  associated  with farms
 there   has  been  some relaxation  of
                                       
{GOVERNMENT }planning  conditions which
 has meant that  others  have been able
 to  buy  sites and  move into the area
                                       
    The area  straddles   two   council
 areas _ Newtownabbey and Ballymena and
 both provide a bin service.           
   {MAINS WATER ,}supplies many  houses
 but others rely  on  water  from wells
 or springs .                          
    No mains {SEWAGE}system is found in
 the area and so all  houses  have     
 their own "septic tank" .
