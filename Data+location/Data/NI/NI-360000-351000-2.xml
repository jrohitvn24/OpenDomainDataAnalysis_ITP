		<title>02SPORT FOR GIRLS</title>
		<content> Sports for girls include camogie,     
 tennis, rounders, netball, basketball 
 and swimming.There are lots more      
 sports for girls but these are some   
 the  enjoyable ones.The most enjoyable
 one I think is camogie as it is good  
                                       
 fun and                               
  it involves running,skill and using  
 your weight.The idea of the game is to
 keep hitting the camogie ball with    
 your camogie stick up to the opponents
 goals and then try to score .It is an 
 enjoyable game for any-one to play.so 
 why don't you join  any one of these  
 sports and you will enjoy one of these
 sports?.
