		<title>19COLLOQUIAL EXPRESSIONS</title>
		<content> This particular area is rich in       
 colloquial expressions with a dialect 
 often bemusing and confusing          
 strangers.  Many colloquialisms are of
 Irish derivation.  Some are used      
 directly while others are Anglicised. 
 A jumper is referred to as a{geansai }
 and a young girl is endearingly called
{Cailin. }A cup of tea is known as a { 
{drop o' tae. }If you make a fool or an
 idiot of yourself you will promptly be
 called an{eejit}or{amadan. }A         
 left-handed person is called a{kitter,
 coming from the Irish{Ciotog.} If the 
 weather is cold you'll be subsequently
{foundered.} A small lane or road is   
 known as a{lonin}and if there is a    
 large number of people with the same  
 surname (the McAteers of Ballyholand),
 you will be told that there is a big {
{clann}of them.
