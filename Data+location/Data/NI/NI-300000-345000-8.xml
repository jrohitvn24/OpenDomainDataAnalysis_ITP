		<title>08   White's Mill</title>
		<content>  The mill has existed in Tandragee    
 since 1840 and was started by a Quaker
 family.It played a important role in  
 the mid 1800's when all of Ireland was
 starving when potato blight destroyed 
 the potato harvest.                   
  The mill makes a series of Oat       
 products rangeing from porrige to     
 toasted oat flakes .Porrige is sold   
 under the brand name of Speedicook.   
 The other products are sold to other  
 firms who mix and bag them under their
 own brands.For example toasted oats   
 are added to muesli's.                
  The oat products are sold  mainly in 
 Ireland, both north and south.        
  The mill has had various owners, one 
 of whom was Rank_Hovis_McDougal (R H  
 M) who tok it oaver in 1976. Today it 
 is owned by a private company, using  
 the brand name{Speedicook}as the      
 company name.                         </content>
