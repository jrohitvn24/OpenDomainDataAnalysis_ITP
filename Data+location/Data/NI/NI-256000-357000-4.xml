		<content>  Provided the bones were not          
 interfered with, the ox was ready for 
 work next day.                        
  One  evening a workman called Mc     
 Mahon picked the marrow out of a bone 
 from the leg of the ox. Next morning  
 the ox was lame. Saint Kieran in anger
 cursed the name of the man who        
 committed the offence and that three  
 of that name would be killed by the   
 church wall falling on them. Two of   
 that name are supposedly killed in the
 intervening years and the gable wall  
 remaining is waiting to claim the     
 third victim.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
