		<content> SOME PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN FARMING   
 AND SOME ARE FISHERMEN. THEY WORK     
 FULL TIME IN THE SUMMER MONTHS        
 CATCHING EELS WHICH THEY SELL TO THE .
 LOUGH NEAGH FISHERMEN'S CO-OPERATIVE  
 SOCIETY. SOME OF THESE MEN HAVE THEIR 
 OWN BOAT WHILE OTHERS WORK ON SOMEONE 
 ELSE'S BOAT.  THEY EARN VERY GOOD     
 MONEY AND CAN TAKE ANOTHER JOB OUTSIDE
 THE FISHING SEASON.                   
                                       
                                       
 MOST OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO TRAVEL TO   
 WORK OUTSIDE THE AREA. A LOT TRAVEL TO
 BELFAST BY CAR AND THE OPENING OF THE 
 MOTORWAY, THE M2, HAS LEFT BELFAST    
 WITHIN EASY TRAVELLING DISTANCE.      
                                       
 OTHERS TRAVEL TO BALLYMENA AND OTHER  
 TOWNS TO WORK AT A VARIETY OF         
 OCCUPATIONS.                          
                                       </content>
