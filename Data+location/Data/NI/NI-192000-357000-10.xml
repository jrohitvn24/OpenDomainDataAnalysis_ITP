 BELLEEK.THE ROADS GO TO ENNISKILLEN,  
 BELLEEK, BALLYSHANNON AND GARRISON.   
 THERE WAS ALWAYS A PUBLIC HOUSE AT THE
 CROSSROADS BUT THE LAST ONE OWNED BY  
 THE SLATER FAMILY WAS BLOWN UP IN     
 1970.DURING THE LAST CENTURY THE PUB  
 WAS BOUGHT BY THE GARVIN FAMILY AND   
 PEOPLE USED TO HAVE THEIR LAST DRINK  
 THERE BEFORE TAKING A STEAMER TO      
 EMIGRATE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY.ON MARKET 
 DAYS IN BELLEEK PEOPLE FROM GARRISON  
 USED TO COME DOWN TO THE FAIR AND USED
 TO DRINK IN SLATERS. EVERY FAIR DAY   
 THE MEN FROM GARRISON USED TO FIGHT   
 WITH THE MEN FROM BELLEEK AND THESE   
 WERE CALLED FACTION FIGHTS.ONE OF THE 
 THINGS THAT REMAIN OF THE OLD PUB IS  
 BIG STONE WHICH WAS CALLED A MOUNTING 
 STONE WHICH WAS TO HELP THE CUSTOMERS 
 GET UP ON THEIR HORSES.
