		<title>19A MAN FROM GALGORM</title>
		<content>  I sat on the pensioners' seat, placed
 there by the Borough Council, beside  
 an elderly gentleman and his poodle,  
 Mitzi. As we talked I discovered that 
 in his eighty years he had witnessed  
 many changes. Where we sat had once   
 been part of a garden, the bakery     
 opposite now two storeys with a slate 
 roof had been a one storey thatched   
 inn. "You could buy three quarts of   
 porter for a shilling" he said. I     
 translated this to present_day terms_ 
 six pints for five pence. "Do you sit 
 here everyday?", I asked. He explained
 that during the day older people used 
 the bench but in the evening the youth
 of the village congregate there. I    
 looked at the crisp packets, broken   
 bottles and empty tins strewn about   
 and the names scored deep in the wood 
 of the bench. "This bench is one week 
 old today",he said.                   </content>
