		<title>10Dundonald Festivals</title>
		<content> The annual festival was held from the 
 11th-19th May. Most of the events,    
 including Football and Badminton were 
 held at the Boys' High School. There  
 were plenty of entries for a 10km-Fun 
 Run for all ages and a men's Tug-Of-  
 War but the Fancy Dress competition   
 with only four entrants and the       
 swimming events showed lack of        
 interest. A team of ten children from 
 our school competed with three other  
 Primary schools in "It's a knockout," 
 which included various types of       
 obstacle races. Tullycarnet school won
 this event and each competitor got a  
 medal. The Disco Championships at     
 Ballybeen Activity Centre was popular.
 On Sunday there was a parade of       
 uniformed organizations. The juniors  
 and seniors went to separate churches.
 Special community services brought the
 festival to a fitting end.            </content>
