		<title>10A FARMER'S DAY</title>
		<content>A dairy farmer starts his day at       
6.45a.m. In the summer time he brings  
in his 77 cows to be milked into the   
milking parlour, where he can milk 8   
cows at a time. At 8.30a.m. he drives  
his herd back into the field where he  
operates a strip grazing method,       
whereby the cows eat a fresh strip of  
grass each time he moves the electric  
fence.                                 
He returns to the milking parlour to   
wash up and to supervize the cooling   
and collecting of the milk. It is      
collected by bulk tanker and           
transported to Omagh milk depot.       
The calves are then feed and the cattle
not being milked are checked on as they
graze in the fields.                   
Other farm duties are undertaken;      
silage making, spreading               
fertilizers, and draining.             
The cows are milked again at 5p.m.     </content>
