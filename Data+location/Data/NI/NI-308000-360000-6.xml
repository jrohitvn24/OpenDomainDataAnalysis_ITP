   We usually play a kind of Chinese   
 tig, but in this, two people are on it
 and chase us on the bikes instead of  
 on foot. The best place to play a game
 like this is where there are lots of  
 buildings.I can remember one time when
 a couple of friends and I asked our   
 big brothers to play with us. The game
 went on for about two hours. At one   
 time only I was left but I managed to 
 set the other ones free.              
   Another game we sometimes play is   
 just ordinary tig only we play it in  
 and out of,some old ruined buildings  
 at the bottom of the road. If there is
 nothing else to do I ride about on my 
 bike and do stunts.
