		<title>03CHANGES ON THE FARM.</title>
		<content>  E.E.C. milk quotas introduced since  
 last April have meant a 10% cut in    
 this farmer's herd. He used to have   
 220 dairy cattle.In the last few years
 a computer has been used to record    
 details of each cow's milk yield.     
  In the next few years the farmer     
 fears even less milk will be needed as
 the public demand less animal fat in  
 their diet.                           
  He wonders if there is a way to use  
 our milk products to feed starving    
 people in other countries. But he asks
 "Who will pay?".                      
  He feels too there is not likely to  
 be the same encouragement from the    
 government to the dairy farmer because
 of the present surplus  of milk       
 products in Europe.                   
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
