		<content> Natural grass would not feed many     
 animals especially in winter,so the   
 farmer drains, spreads fertiliser, or 
 re-seeds. In summer animals graze but 
 in winter extra food is needed.Much of
 this is silage or hay.                
{SILAGE} is chopped, stored green grass
 which is sealed and covered until     
 needed.It is cut by a forage harvester
 in June and again in August.{THE      
{FARMER MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO LET THE 
{SILAGE SEEPAGE RUN INTO RIVERS BECAUSE
{IT KILLS FISH.}                       
 Farmers used to make hay but now      
 silage is more popular.{Hay making    
 requires much more work and is not as 
 fattening food for cattle.Hay is cut  
 in July .Next it is turned,kicked and 
 baled before being stored in sheds.{  
{DUSTY HAY CAN CAUSE FARMERS LUNG.}
