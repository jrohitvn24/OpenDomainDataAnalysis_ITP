		<content>  {The Mill}is about half a mile from  
 our school. The mill was built in     
{1900.}Inside the house there are four 
 rooms two upstairs ,two downstairs.   
 The ones upstairs were never used     
 because they were too small. The beds 
 were downstairs in the living room.   
 Inside the house  was cold because a  
 fire was never put on.                
  {Eight people}lived in the house.    
 Their names were Margraret,Charlie,   
 Irene,Nancy,Robin,Carol,Olive and     
 Gloria.Six of them were born in the   
 mill house.Irene was 10 when she      
 left.They all went to the{Old Gate    
{school.

{timber.}There was a{corn thrasher     
 beside the house, it was used for     
{grinding grain.
