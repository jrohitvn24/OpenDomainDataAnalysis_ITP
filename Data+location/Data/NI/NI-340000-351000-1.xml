		<content> The Ballynahinch River was largely    
 responsible for the growth of the area
 as the local people worked in the     
 scutching and corn mills powered by   
 the water from the river.The area is  
 very beautiful as the river meanders  
 in a glaciated valley through green   
 drumlins.Our school,Drumaghlis Primary
 School is a small,maintained two      
 teacher school.It is maintained       
 jointly by Kilmore Presbyterian Church
 and the South Eastern Education and   
 Library Board.The school and church   
 form the nucleus of the community with
 the majority of the children living   
 within one to two miles of the school.
 The only recreational pursuits for the
 neighbourhood are connected to the two
 local churches.These are mostly       
 sporting activities or women's        
 meetings.In Crossgar there are        
 uniformed organisations for children. </content>
