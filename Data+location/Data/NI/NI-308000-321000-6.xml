		<title>06RAILWAY LINES IN FATHOM</title>
		<content> Today stand two railway lines side by 
 side in this block.  One is in present
 day use and is the main Belfast_Dublin
 railway line, however the other is in 
 a state of disrepair.  The reason for 
 this is that this particular track was
 built on marshy land and as it sunk,  
 it had to be replaced.  Part of this  
 old track is known as "{Bearnacnoc}"  
 which is the Gaelic for "{The gap at  
{the  hill.}" Today this track is used 
 by local pedestrians only.  The latest
 railway track stands along side it.   
 This is an extremely useful line as 26
 goods and passenger trains pass daily 
 from Belfast to Dublin.  An equivalent
 number of trains make the return      
 journey.  The new track is constantly 
 subjected to terrorist attacks due to 
 the present political troubles.
