		<title>19LAW AND ORDER</title>
		<content> The two forces which keep law and     
 order in our area are{The Royal       
{Ulster Constabulary}and{The Ulster    
{Defence Regiment.                     
 The{RUC (or police)}do much useful    
 work. They enforce speed limits on the
 roads and prosecute careless drivers. 
 They also investigate break-ins and   
 track down all types of criminals.    
 People who are charged by the police  
 appear in court, and may be fined or  
 imprisoned. There are{RUC Stations at 
{Ballymoney and Cloughmills.           
 The{UDR (or army)}is mainly engaged in
 tracking down IRA terrorists. This is 
 done through road check-points and    
 searches.                             
 If anyone needs help urgently, they   
 dial 999. Patrol cars are summoned by 
 short wave radio, and one is soon at  
 the scene of the trouble.
