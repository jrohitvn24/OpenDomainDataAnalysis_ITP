		<title>04OUR LOLLIPOP LADY</title>
		<content> Mrs.McQuillan wears thick-rimmed      
 glasses,                              
 And everytime she passes,             
 She says,"How are you today?"         
 In her own very happy way.            
 I like her a lot,                     
 She likes me too,                     
 She is as nice as Mum,                
 She is my special friend,             
 And I am her friend too,              
 She wears a coat,                     
 And a colourful scarf,                
 She has a lollipop.                   
 She is my second best friend,         
 you see,                              
 Because I like her very much.
