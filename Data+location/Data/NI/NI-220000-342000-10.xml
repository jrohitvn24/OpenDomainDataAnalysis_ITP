		<title>10SHOPPING IN ENNISKILLEN</title>
		<content>    Most of the main shops of the town 
 are to be found near the Diamond.This 
 forms the{Central Business District}of
 the town.For its size there is a wide 
 variety of shops.This is partially    
 explained by the fact that it is the  
 County town of Fermanagh and partly by
 the fact that it is so close to the   
 border with the Irish Republic,from   
 where many shoppers now come.The      
 prices in Northern Ireland are        
 generally cheaper than in S.Ireland   
 and many come for "value".            
   Apart from the normal goods many    
 shops try to offer goods for the      
 tourist trade.These souvenir goods,few
 of which are locally made, represent  
 images of Fermanagh which tourists    
 like.The most popular shops are       
 Woolworths,Wellworths and the clothes 
 shops,the first two being largish     
 department stores.                    </content>
