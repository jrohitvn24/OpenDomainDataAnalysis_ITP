		<title>07GROOMSPORT CARAVAN PARK</title>
		<content>   For our project my friend and I     
 decided to interview prople using     
 caravan parks in Groomsport.This      
 village is situated along the coast   
 about 17 miles from Belfast.These were
 some of the questions we asked.       
 1 Where in N.Ireland do you live?     
 2 How many are staying in your        
   caravan?                            
 3 How long have you had a caravan?    
 4 Why do you come to Groomsport?      
 5 Have there been any changes since   
   you started coming here?            
 6 Will you come here again?           
                                       
   When we went to our first caravan we
 were told that the family came from   
 Belfast.They had been coming to       
 Groomsport for 5 years and liked the  
 beaches there.Only members of the     
 family stayed in the caravan.Over     
 the 5 years things had improved.      </content>
