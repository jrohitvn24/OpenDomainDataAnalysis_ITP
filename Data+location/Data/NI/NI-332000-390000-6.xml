		<title>06POPULATION AND HOUSING</title>
		<content>   Most  people  in  this block live in
{farmhouses} in the countryside. If the
 houses are not  lived  in  by  farmers
 they are occupied  by  people who have
 some interests in the  land and a full
 time   job   in   Ballyclare,   Larne,
 Carrickfergus or Belfast.             
   In 1973  new{bungalows}were built at
 the top end of the village. This added
 greatly  to  the  population  of   the
{village.}Most people who live in these
 houses  work  outside the village.  In
 recent  times  older  members  of  the
 surrounding  countryside  are retiring
 and coming to live in the village.    
   The  housing  in  the village itself
 has not changed much in appearance  in
 the  last  century.  Any   alterations
 reflect the {character}of the village.
