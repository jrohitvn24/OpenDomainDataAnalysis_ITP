<content>

Larne town has changed considerably over the last 25 years. There has been much commercial development within the town itself and on the outskirts. The  Laharna complex was built a few years ago, comprising of several different shops e.g. Lidl, Menarys, New Look, M&amp;CO. Further out of the town, towards the harbour, there is now a large Asda store as well as a brand new omniplex, Domino's Pizza, Chinese restaurant and grill bar. KFC also built a branch in Larne several years ago. Some of the old blocks of flats have been demolished and new modern ones have been erected at the other end of the town.   &lt;br />
