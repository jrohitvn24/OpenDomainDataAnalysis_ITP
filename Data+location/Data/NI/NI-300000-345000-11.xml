		<title>11   Sinton's Mill</title>
		<content>  Tandragee has a reputation for linen 
 manufacture.In the early 1800's it had
 one of the principal linen markets in 
 County Armagh and exported linen      
 clothes to England, America, West     
 Indies &amp; Spain.                       
                                       
  In 1881 Sinton's mill in Tandragee   
 employed over 600 people and the      
 firm's nearby mill in Laurelvale      
 employed over 700.The employees were  
 mostly women. As the popuation of     
 Tandragee, in 1881, was 1592, the mill
 must have employed a member of almost 
 every household.                      
                                       
  Today the mill in Laurelvale no      
 longer exists, and the Tandragee mill 
 employs a fraction of the 1881 figures
 Linen threads are its main product,   
 spun from flax imported from across   
 the water.                            </content>
