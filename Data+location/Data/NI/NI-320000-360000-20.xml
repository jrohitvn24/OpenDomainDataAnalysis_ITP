		<title>20MAZE GOAT FARM</title>
		<content> There are two {Goat Farms }in the Maze
 area, one in {Halftown Road }and the  
 other in {Bog Road }and owned by the {
{Patterson Family}.                    
 The Pattersons keep mainly {Nubian }  
 goats and these graze happily in the  
 adjacent field.Each goat has it's own 
 name and the herd is treated like a   
 group of family pets.They are milked  
 twice a day and their{milk }is        
 recommended for {asthmatic }sufferers 
 and to help give a healthy{complexion.
 The milk is sealed in plastic pint    
 bags and sold to locals and to shops  
 in {Lisburn} at 25 pence per          
 pint.Unlike cow's milk,goat's milk    
 will keep in a fridge for up to ten   
 days and can even be frozen for       
 future use.                           
 Many of our class sampled chilled     
 goat's milk for the first time and    
 found it to be {Delicious}!           </content>
