		<title>02NEW INDUSTRY IN DUNGANNON</title>
		<content>                                       
 Twenty years ago industry in this area
 was mainly concerned with the         
 manufacturing of cloth, but cheap     
 foreign imports of clothes etc. have  
 stolen the markets of the home        
 manufacturers. As a result the three  
 main clothing factories, which        
 employed over two thousand people,    
 have closed down.                     
 In this area as a whole unemployment  
 is quite high; 28% of the working     
 population are unemployed. However    
 over the past ten years a number of   
 small factories have been built in the
 Dungannon area mainly centred at a new
 industrial estate at Granville. These 
 factories are engaged in a diverse    
 number of activities from meat        
 packaging and frozen foods to         
 furniture making and light            
 engineering.                          </content>
