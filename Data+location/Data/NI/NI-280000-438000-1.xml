		<content> Porstewart is a coastal town and      
 seaside resort with a population in   
 excess of 5000. It is mainly a        
 residential town catering for holiday 
 makers in the summer months and       
 students for the nearby University in 
 the winter months. It is part of the  
 Causeway Coast with picturesque views 
 of the barmouth where the river Baun  
 flows into the sea, the north Derry   
 Hills and Donegal mountains to the    
 west.                                 
 The main feature of the town is its   
 Promenade overlooked by the present   
 Dominican College, formerly O'Haras   
 castle. The resort attracts tourists  
 with its famous Strand and numerous   
 recreational activities. In May of    
 each year the town hosts the world

 while in June an annual evangelical   
 Convention is held.                   </content>
