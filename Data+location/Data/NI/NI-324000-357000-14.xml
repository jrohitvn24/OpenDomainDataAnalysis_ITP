		<content>{There are four main areas of trade.   
    {1.}The picturesque quality of     
 Hillsborough has brought it's growth  
 as a{mecca for visitors.}As a result  
 many shops have sprung up to cater for
 them. Examples are the three antique  
 shops and Crafts and Tweeds.          
    {2.}Over the years the village has 
 been considered a desirable place in  
 which to have an address and several  
{'up-market' businesses}have been set  
 up. Examples here are Graham Harron,  
 the gold-smith and the Red Fox for    
 ladies' fashions.                     
    {3.}The Hillsborough dweller needs 
 the{everyday things}a village can     
 provide, butcher, grocer, chemist.    
    {4.}Both villager and visitor like 
 to{relax.}Hillsborough has four pubs, 
 one hotel and a coffee shop.
