		<content> In 1842 flax spinning was carried out 
 at Upper Woodburn and cotton spinning 
 at Duncrue.  There was a bleach green 
 with also wadding and cotton bands    
 manufactured at Woodburn.  These in   
 turn were replaced by a weaving       
 factory and bleachworks.  The source  
 of power for these factories was      
 obtained from the Woodburn river alias
 Wud burn i.e. mad river.              
                                       
      In February 1903 the Woodburn    
 Weaving Factory was gutted by a       
 disastrous fire causing Â£25,000 of    
 damage.  The Belfast Fire Brigade were
 called out and covered the journey of 
 11 miles in one hour.                 
                                       
      In September 1903 Carrickfergus  
 got its first engine, this manual     
 engine was replaced in 1908 with a    
 steam fire engine.                    </content>
