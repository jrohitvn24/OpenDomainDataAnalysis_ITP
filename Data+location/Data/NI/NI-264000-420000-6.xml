   The Deer Park Wood is used as part  
of a tourist amenity, the Roe Valley   
Country Park.                          
   About half of the land is used for  
grazing and silage growing. The animals
mainly grazed are beef cattle and sheep
though there are some large dairy herds
just outside our area (700 cattle in   
one herd).                             
   About one third of the land is used 
for crops mainly barley, wheat and     
potatoes.                              
   In recent years oil seed rape has   
become very popular and several large  
fields have been planted this year. The
seed is harvested at the end of July by
combine harvesters, the stalk is burned
and the seed crushed to produce        
vegetable oil and then margarine.
