 MORE OF THEIR TIME IN COMMUNITY       
 SERVICE.  THIS INVOLVES VISITING OLD  
 AND SICK PEOPLE IN THE AREA.  THEY ARE
 ALSO CLOSELY INVOLVED IN HELPING THE  
 HANDICAPPED AND EVEN INCLUDE A        
 HANDICAPPED MEMBER IN THEIR GROUP.    
 CURRENTLY THEY ARE INVOLVED IN RAISING
 MONEY TO HELP BUILD A DAM IN TILONIA

 RAISED ENOUGH MONEY TO GO TO          
 SWITZERLAND.                          
 THE CHURCH OF IRELAND, ROMAN CATHOLIC,
 KILKEEL PRESBYTERIAN AND BAPTIST
