		<content> The Workhouse in Magherafelt was one  
 ofthe first hundred to be built in    
 Ireland.It was built to house the     
 hungry and forgotten people of some   
 twenty-five districts.It was designed 
 to hold nine hundred people.It was    
 completed in 1842.And on the 10th     
 March,1842,it was opened.The first    
 admission was the next day.On the 1st 
 January 1843,there were 219 people in 
 the workhouse.Shortly after the       
 opening of the workhouse,the great    
 Irish famine broke out,(1846-1847).   
 The Workhouses,were unable to house   
 all the needy. On the 24th August 1941
 the Workhouse in Maghrafelt was       
 shut down.Work began on converting it 
 into a hospital.                      
    'Once it was the House of Sorrow:  
     Now 'tis the House of Health and  
                               Hope.'
