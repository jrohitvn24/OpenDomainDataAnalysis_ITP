		<content>   Like most cities this area has      
 suffered badly from the               
 recession. Unlike most cities the     
 problem was much worse here to begin  
 with. The only large scale            
 industrial{employer}in the area is the
{engineering}firm of Mackie's which has
 traditionally drawn most of it's      
 workforce from outside the immediate  
 area. A small industrial estate on the
 upper Springfield has a number of     
 light engineering and service         
 industries. Traditional (female)      
 employment in the{mills}has           
 disappeared with the growth of the    
 man-made fibre industry.              
  With unemployment over 30%, and the  
 problems of the area to put investors 
 off, the opening of the new Park      
 Centre{hypermarket}has provided       
 hundreds of badly needed jobs.
