		<content>       {Whiteabbey Hospital}is situated
 in our area on the corner of Doagh    
 Road and O'Neill Road.                
        In 1904 a mansion house called 
 "The Abbey" was bought as an auxiliary
 workhouse and over the years since    
 then it has expanded into quite a     
 large hospital.                       
        In recent times however it has 
 become the centre of a row. The Health
 Board wants to close it and make the  
 Belfast hospitals bigger while people 
 who live in Newtownabbey want to see  
 it improved. For example, the hospital
 has a Casualty Dept. but it closes at 
 5:30 pm and is not open at weekends,  
 nor can it do major operations. This  
 is a pity especially as this is the   
 third largest town in N.I.            
        I don't think they should close
 it just to save money. What would     
 happen to someone injured on Saturday?</content>
