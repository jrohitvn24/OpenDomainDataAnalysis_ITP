		<title>17THE SOUTERAIN.</title>
		<content> archaelogical expert thought it likely
 that a system of similar chambers lay 
 underneath the 10 acre field.He said  
 that Souterains were used for storing 
 food,or as a refuge from enemies.     
  The Souterains are a common feature  
 in Co.Antrim,usually found with ring  
 forts.Unlike those in Co.Down which   
 are linear in shape,those in Co.Antrim
 have chambers going off at rt.angles. 
 This Souterain which dates as far back
 as 800 A.D.is to be investigated by   
 the Department of the Environment once
 the barley crop has been cut in       
 August.                               
   Perhaps many more lie undiscovered  
 beneath our countryside,awaiting some 
 curious mind,the course of nature or  
 simply _Time _to uncover our past for 
 the future.
