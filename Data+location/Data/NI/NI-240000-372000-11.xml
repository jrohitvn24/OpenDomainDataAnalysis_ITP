 The furniture in our houses are quite 
 basic although we are fond of frills  
 and studs. We use tables which are    
 usually made of wood with round or    
 square tops and four legs. We sit     
 around the table on wooden four legged
 chairs with backs. The kitchen has    
 cupboards, a cooker (which has four   
 rings which heat), a washing machine  
 and a bin for rubbish.  Other         
 implements include toasters, dish     
 washers, pots and pans.               
 Bedrooms are occupied by beds, a      
 wardrobe, dressing table and          
 occasional furniture.                 
                                       
 In the lounge we find  curtains,      
 lamps,carpets and also a television   
 which brings us news and fiction from 
 other parts of the world.             </content>
