		<title>19CHANGES IN DUNDONALD</title>
		<content> There have been many changes in       
 Dundonald in recent years;new houses, 
 shops and now plans for a leisure     
 centre and a new police station.On the
 Comber Rd.Graham's Bridge was knocked 
 down to widen the road.In the same    
 area a river walk was built which     
 passes the Girls High School.There are
 new developments on the Comber Rd,like
 Millar's Forge.Further up the Comber  
 Rd five shops and houses for the      
 elderly have been built.The Enler     
 river has been piped up which prevents
 it overflowing into the gardens.The   
 Moat Park has been extended and a     
 fountain put in.At the top of East    
 Link Road new grass pitches were built
 but on the opposite side of the road a
 football pitch was taken away to make 
 room for the new Dundonald            
 International Ice Bowl.
