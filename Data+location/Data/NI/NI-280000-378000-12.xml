		<content>   Only the rich could afford cars 80  
 years ago,but the poorer people walked
 or rode bicycles.Most children walked 
 or rode bicycles to school and they   
 often had to walk over fields.The     
 Moneymore Road is very wide with a    
 dual carriageway to Moneymore.The     
 roads used to be rough with pot-holes 
 and now they are nicely tarred.Lorries
 and cars had solid tyres and when     
 people travelled on rough roads they  
 got very bumpy rides.Children have the
 priviledge of going to school by a car
 or bus and the roads are smooth.      
   Milburn Streer used to be long,muddy
 and quiet and there used to be a water
 pump in it too.Now it is busy,clean,  
 long and noisy.                       
   This area around Cookstown has been 
 greatly modernised and is as modern as
 any other town.
