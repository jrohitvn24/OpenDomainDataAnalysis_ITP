 On Sunday morning I went to 8.30 a.m. 
 mass in St. Paul's. After mass my     
 grandad collected me outside the      
 chapel. He had my fishing rod and     
 other fishing gear. We were going to  
 fish in the River Bann. When we got   
 there I put on my wellies and started 
 fixing my gear up. I cast my line out 
 and then I waited. About ten minutes  
 later there was a tug at my line and  
 then another. I started reeling it in 
 quicker and quicker. Suddenly it      
 popped up out of the water. It was a  
 trout! It was about twelve inches in  
 length and about three in width. Later
 on I caught a few more but they       
 weren't as big as the first one. At   
 about two o'clock we had our lunch.   
 When we came back I met my friend     
 Junior Cooney who was fishing beside  
 us with his dad.   Jonathan McKerr.   </content>
