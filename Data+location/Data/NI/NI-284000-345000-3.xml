		<content> Eventually Armagh schooled some 7000  
 students in its{'university'}and was  
 the prime scene of education in       
 Europe.Such eminence and wealth made  
 Armagh a major target for the         
{Vikings.Tergesius}laid the city in    
 ashes in 836 and the same fate befell 
 it on regular occasions thereafter.   
{King Brian Boru}was brought to Armagh 
 and buried in the Cathedral grounds   
 after the{Battle of Clontarf}in 1014  
 which ended the Viking dominance.In   
 the 12th to 16th centuries Armagh was 
 unfortunate to lie between the Irish  
{O'Neills of Dungannon}and the English 
 settlements in County Down. The City  
 suffered the effects of ongoing       
 strife. In the 18th and early 19th    
 century more settled conditions led to
 trade and commerce flourishing.Most of
 the fine buildings that grace Armagh  
 today were built during that period.  </content>
