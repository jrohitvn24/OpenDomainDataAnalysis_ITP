		<content> We found out from our survey that     
 ten out of nineteen families own more 
 than one car because all families in  
 Drumaghlis need cars to travel about  
 in because it is two miles from the   
 nearest town.All of the children in   
 our school own a bicycle.A Bmx is a   
 bike which has no mudguards.It can    
 either have mag or spokes for the     
 inside of the wheels.A standard bike  
 has mudguards and spokes.A racer has  
 big wheels,gears and bent handle bars 
 for fast racing on roads.A Bmx is     
 built for rough ground so you can have
 tracks across the fields.The only     
 families owning lorries in our        
 district are Glovers of "Rock Mills". 
 There are very few contracting        
 machines in our area and these are    
 owned by Gills Contractors and        
 Watsons.
