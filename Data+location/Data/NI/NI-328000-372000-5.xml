		<title>05     Local Elections</title>
		<content> The most notable event in our area has
 been the{local elections}held on May  
 15th.  The main parties involved were 
 the Official Unionists, the Democratic
 Unionists, the Social Democratic and  
 Labour Party, the Alliance Party and  
{Sinn Fein.} Sinn Fein openly support  
 terrorism yet they had a strong vote  
 here in{West Belfast.} Teresa Holland,
 the first{woman}to be{interned}in     
 Northern Ireland was elected for the  
 Upper Falls.  She said "Sinn Fein is  
 going to highlight{sectarianism}and   
{discrimination}that has always        
 existed and they intend to push the   
 needs of the Nationalist people".     
 Sinn Fein's poll success looks certain
 to put more pressure on the{British   
{and Irish governments}to find a       
{political solution}for the{North.} The
 Off. Unionists and the DUP are set to 
 join together to isolate Sinn Fein.   </content>
