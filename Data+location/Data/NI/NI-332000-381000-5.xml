		<content>       We live in Rathcoole and my dad 
 works in{Camco}which is a factory just
 a couple of kilometres from our house.
 They make parts for{oil rigs}there and
 our teacher took some of us to see    
 what it was like. I just had to go.   
       We were shown round by the      
 foreman who warned us to keep our     
 hands away from the machines or we    
 might lose them! It is a very noisy   
 and dirty place though my dad says you
 get used to that. You must because    
 they give you a medal for every 5     
 years you work there and dad is going 
 for his third.                        
       Camco was founded in 1958 and   
 now employs 350 men. Most of the parts
 they make go to Eastern Europe. Many  
 machines are computerised but they    
 still need skilled workmen and they   
 have their own training school just   
 beside the factory.                   </content>
