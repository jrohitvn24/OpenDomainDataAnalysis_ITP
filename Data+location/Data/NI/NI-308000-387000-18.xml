		<content>   {THE BLACK HEAD OF THE O'NEILLS:    
         This can be seen about 20 feet
 upon the east face of one of the      
 ruined towers of Shanes Castle.It is a
 small stone head carved on a          
 cornerstone.Tradition says that should
 the head fall, the O'Neill family will
 come to an end.                       
                                       
{   THE LEGEND OF THE RED HAND:}The red
 hand is a main feature of the O'Neill 
 coat of arms.A Viking ship was        
 approaching the Ulster coastline and  
 the captain told his crew that the    
 first to touch the shore with his     
 right hand would have the land for    
 himself.One of the crew called Neil   
 cut off his right hand and threw it   
 onto the shore.                       
    The Red Hand of O'Neill became the 
 emblem of Ulster.
