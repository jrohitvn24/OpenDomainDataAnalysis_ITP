		<title>04SCARVA DEMENSE</title>
		<content> When King William III encamped in     
 Scarva many gifts of food were given  
 by the local people,in particular by  
 one Reilly. Later the King decided to 
 reward Reilly's hospitality ,he told  
 him that he would give him as much    
 land as he could walk round in a day. 
   Taking the King at his word he set  
 out at sunrise and walked to sunset   
 staking out his claim. The estate was 
 much larger than it is today as the   
 land let to the tenant farmers became 
 their property under the Irish Land   
 Purchase Act.                         
   The mansion house, Scarva House,    
 built in 1717 is a beautiful          
 Elizabethan Mansion is still well     
 preserved. The present owner is Mr.   
 William Buller.
