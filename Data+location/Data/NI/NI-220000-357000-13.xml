 years of age attend the{Controlled    
{Primary School.}The school was opened 
 in 1974 and replaced 3 small schools:

 We learn to read and write in English 
 and do mathematics.This year Primary 6
 and 7 had four visits to the Ulster-  
 American Park;we studied life in both 
 countries and emigration in the early 
 18th century.We have made a play about
 a family going to America and learned 
 some emigration songs.After school the
 boys play football and the girls play 
 netball;in the Summer term some pupils
 take the Cycling Proficiency course.On
 Thursdays we go to swimming and we do 
 country dancing on Friday.Everybody   
 enjoys the school dinners and most    
 travel to school by bus.Next year the 
 pupils in P7 go to Secondary Schools. </content>
