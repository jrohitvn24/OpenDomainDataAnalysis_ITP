		<content>   There are two main types of house   
 ownership, private (owned by a        
 particular person) &amp; public (owned by 
 Housing Executive.)Recently tenants in
 public housing can purchase their home
 at special rates, depending on the    
 length of tenancy. Looking at estates 
 like Derrychara or Chanterhill it is  
 easy to recognise houses bought by    
 their new renovations &amp; improved      
 appearance. There are a variety of    
 houses &amp; sizes - 3 bedroom 4 unit     
 terraced blocks, 2 bedroom pensioner  
 bungalows, 4 bedroom semi-detached &amp; 2
 storey blocks of flats.               
   In the private sector most homes are
 modern bungalows, some split level,   
 semi-detached &amp; detached all with     
 modern amenities in their own grounds.
 In rural areas there is a good        
 standard of farm house. Many house    
 holders qualify for improvement grants</content>
