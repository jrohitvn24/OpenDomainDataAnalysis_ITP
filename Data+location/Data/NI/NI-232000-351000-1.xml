		<title>01Brougher Mountain.</title>
		<content>      Our Survey Block is south of     
 Trillick.It includes the townlands of 
 Dreigh,Cloncandra,Lifford,Rossnareen, 
 Killyblunick,Brougher,Golan,Effernan, 
 Derryallen and Glen.                  
      The area is dominated by Brougher
 Mountain which covers roughly two     
 thirds of the block.The summit is     
 roughly one thousand feet above sea   
 level.Several television masts are    
 situated on top of the mountain.The   
 section  of the mountain over seven   
 hundred feet is covered with heather. 
 Underneath the heather is a layer of  
 peat which is cut as a fuel.The lower 
 region of the mountain is used by     
 farmers as rough grazing for cattle.  
      On the other one third of the    
 area farmers keep suckling herds.Very 
 little silage or hay is mown.Overall  
 the land is poor.
