		<content> 1   The Blacksmith's Shop             
                                       
                                       
 In the early 1920's there used to be a
 blacksmith's shop in Ravarnette. The  
 family business was owned by Walter   
 Long. Walter died in November 1985.   
 His shop opened at 7 in the morning   
 and did not close until late at night.
  The blacksmith's made gates, ploughs 
 and harrows.  On long winter nights   
 there was never much to do and peopke 
 gathered and played darts until 11 pm.
 In those days it cost 5 shillings to  
 shoe a horse.  Nowaydays you would    
 have to pay 10 pounds to shoe a pony. 
 The blacksmith was opposite the school
 at the corner of Legacurry Road. In   
 1959 the Blacksmith's Shop closed     
 owing to a family death.
