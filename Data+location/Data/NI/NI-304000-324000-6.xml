 provide community centres for people  
 of the area.The community centre for  
 this area is called Loanda House.It   
 was built by the Newry and Mourne     
 District Council and comes under their
 Tourist and Recreation Department.    
                        A community    
 centre tries to cater for all the     
 needs of the people of an area.Loanda 
 House is used during the day by the   
 unemployed.There they can play table  
 tennis,badminton,snooker,pool,or just 
 watch TV.During the day old aged      
 pensioners can go there and get their 
 dinner.At night school children can go
 to the centre and use it as a youth   
 club.They can do additional activities
 like boxing,Break dancing and         
 weightlifting.Adults can also go and  
 play indoor bowls.Discos are provided 
 at the weekends for young and old.    </content>
