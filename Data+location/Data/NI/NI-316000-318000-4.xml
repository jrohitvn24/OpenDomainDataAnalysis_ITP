		<title>04ST.BRONAGH'S BELL</title>
		<content>    There was once a chieftain called  
 Fergus who lived in County Down.He was
 out hunting one day when he met Artan 
 a neighbour.They quarrelled and       
 fought.Fergus thought that he had     
 killed Artan so he bought a bell and  
 offered it to the Convent which at    
 that time was at the Crag.This was an 
 act of penance and he became a        
 pilgrim.                              
 For about a thousand years,long after 
 the building became derelict,the bell 
 was still heard from time to time.    
 No one knew where the sound came from.
 In 1885 a large oak tree which stood  
 near the old church was blown down in 
 a storm and inside the rotted tree was
 part of St.Bronagh's bell.            
 It is now used in the Star of the Sea 
 Church in Rostrevor.
