		<content> Most of the vegetation in this block  
 is on farmland. The main area of      
 natural vegetation is on the upper    
 part of the Slievenaman ridge. Here   
 rough grasses, heathland species and  
 whins are the main vegetation types   
 with frequent rocky outcrops through  
 the thin soil. The rocky parts are    
 well covered in lichens. The other    
 area of moorland is the shoulder of   
 Luke's Mountain at 318303 where the   
 vegetation is similar to that found in
 block 03270328.The wet area at 313302 
 has large numbers of Sundew plants    
 Drosera rotundifolia. Clonachullion   
 Hill has recently been planted with   
 young conifers. The Trassey plantation
 at 313306 has been established for    
 some 20 years. 1984 saw a large       
 infestation of Pine Beauty Moth which 
 smothered several hundred yards but   
 the trees have recovered this year.   </content>
