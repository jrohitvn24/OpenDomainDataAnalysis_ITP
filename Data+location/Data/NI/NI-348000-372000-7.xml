		<content> Government is organised on a tier     
 system local, regional and national.  
 At local level public affairs are     
 administered by the Borough Council   
 consisting of a Mayor and l9          
 councillors who are elected using a   
 system of proportional representation 
 (a single transferrable vote). The    
 council is responsible for            
 Environmental health, Community       
 Relations, Parks and Cemeteries,      
 Building Control and Cleansing. The   
 council is financed by rates imposed  
 on property owners. At regional level 
 there are various departments e.g.    
 Environment, Health, Education and    
 Agriculture. The council has          
 representation within these           
 departments which are financed by     
 taxation. At national level a         
 politician is elected using the X     
 voting system.                        </content>
