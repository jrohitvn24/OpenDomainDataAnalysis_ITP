		<title>07ROWALLANE GARDENS,SAINTFIELD</title>
		<content>   The gardens are over 100 years old, 
 and were once a farm,bought by a Scot 
 named Rev.Moore.He brought stones from
 Bloody Bridge,Newcastle,and planted   
 trees to form shelter,without altering
 the existing grassland.Eighty years   
 ago,Rowallane passed to his nephew,   
 Hugh Armitage Moore,who was interested
 in foreign plants.He obtained seeds   
 from the Americas,Australia,Africa,   
 Europe and the Far East.The gardens   
 were named after the first plant to   
 bloom there.The Rhododendrons are the 
 main attraction,although there are    
 many rare plants.                     
    There are 52 acres of gardens,and  
 158 acres of grazing land.The gardens 
 became the property of the National   
 Trust in 1956.The National Trust is   
 not supported by the government.It    
 takes 50,000 pounds a year to maintain
 the gardens.                          </content>
