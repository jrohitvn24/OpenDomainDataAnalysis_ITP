		<title>07JIMMY HADDOCK</title>
		<content> This story about Jimmy Haddock, who is
 buried in St. Patrick's churchyard, is
 important because it was written down 
 at the time. Jimmy Haddock died and   
 his property was suposed to go to his 
 son but his wife gave the property to 
 someone else.For 4 years Jimmy        
 Haddock's ghost appeared to a         
 parishioner called Tavener and told   
 him to take the case to court.        
 Tavener said he had no witnesses.     
 Tavener was plagued by the ghost      
 everywhere he went untill he was      
 forced to take the case to            
 Carrickfergus court. In the court     
 Tavener said to call Jimmy Haddock.   
 Everyone in the court laughed and     
 thought how can he come when he is    
 dead. A great wind shook the court,a  
 hand appeared on the Bible and a voice
 said "Is this enough?"The judge said  
 that it was.Jimmy's son won the case. </content>
