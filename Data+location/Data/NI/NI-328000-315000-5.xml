  As previously stated, farming is the 
 main employer of this region. However,
 in the south-east corner of the grid  
 we find two of the main manufacturing 
 concerns of the Kilkeel and Mourne    
 district - Aircraft Furnishings       
 Limited and Moor Steel.               
                                       
  {AIRCRAFT FURNISHINGS LIMITED}       
  In an interview conducted by         
 Julie-Anne Donaldson and Jim Hanna    
 with the firm's Production Director J.
 P. Doran it was learned how, since    
 1968, the company had expanded on its 
 site to employ over 140 people.This   
 factory is a subsidiary of an         
 Anglo-American company involved in the
 production of aircraft seats for such 
 customers as British Airways, Cathay  
 Pacific and Short Brothers of Belfast.
 Most of the raw materials are imported</content>
