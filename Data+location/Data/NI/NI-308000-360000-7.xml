  Today Gary and I are going to a ten  
 mile Sponsored walk for Irish         
 language. The name of the walk is the 
 Siul Fada, which means the long walk. 
 I phoned up Gary to tell him to call  
 for me at one o'clock .  When Gary    
 called for me we we went down to      
 Davitt Park to get our cards signed.  
 Then we started to walk.  It was three
 o'clock now and we were at Lough      
 Neagh.We got a picnic there.  When we 
 had finished the picnic we started    
 walking again, this time heading for  
 home. Then the man with the speaker   
 said there was another mile to go.    
 When I had collected my sponsor money 
 I went back to the house again.
