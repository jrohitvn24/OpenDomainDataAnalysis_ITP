		<title>03CRUMLIN FIRESTATION.</title>
		<content> In Crumlin there is a Firestation on  
 Mill Road. It has three fire engines  
 but only two are used.A siren call    
 the men if there is a fire.It lasts   
 about one minute.The siren is used    
 because there are no full-time        
 firemen,they each have thier own jobs 
 and are only part-time firemen.Each   
 fireman has a pocket bleeper in case  
 he cannot hear the siren.The firemen  
 practise once a week.The siren is     
 always heard at 7.00pm on Monday      
 nights when they have an inspection.  
 The Firestation is opposite the school
 and beside the Police station. There  
 are about six firemen to a fire engine
 and there are 15 men in the station   
 who can be called on.All the firemen  
 wear yellow helmets and black boots,  
 yellow trousers and jackets when they 
 go to fight a fire.
