		<content> In Bannvale Special Care Hospital     
 there are about 45 people employed.   
 They do the cleaning, driving and     
 nursing. There are about 45 mentally  
 retarded men. The handicapped men do  
 not have a room to themselves but they
 have dormitories and they each have   
 their personalized clothing. There is 
 plenty of recreation equipment for the
 mentally retarded such as rowing      
 machines, exercise bicycles, bowls,   
 snooker tables, pool tables, table    
 tennis, music centres, footballs and  
 swings. The staff take the patients on
 holidays to such places as Portrush,  
 Isle of Man and Blackpool. Some of the
 boys go home for the weekend when     
 their parents come. Some of the boys  
 were involved in the Special Olympics 
 in America in 1984 where they were    
 successful in bringing home some gold,
 silver and bronze medals.             </content>
