		<title>08EATING IN DUNDONALD</title>
		<content>   We asked 130 children in our school 
 obout their families eating habits.   
 Usually the main meal of the day is   
 in the evening and tends to be home   
 cooked rather than convenience food   
 or a carry out.In regard to what they 
 actually eat they prefer meat to      
 vegetarian dishes,white bread to brown
 ,and fresh vegetables and fruit to    
 tinned or frozen.Most families don't  
 have a cooked breakfast but do have a 
 special meal at home on Sunday.When   
 people eat out they choose the comfort
 of a restaurant as opposed to a       
 carryout but only half prefer waitress
 service to a self-service buffet.     
 Foreign food is as popular as more    
 traditional fare.Electricity is the   
 main source of energy used despite    
 the presence of a gas bottling plant  
 in the area.A substantal minority 25% 
 of homes have microwave ovens.        </content>
