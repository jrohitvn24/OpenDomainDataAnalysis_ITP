		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content> The dominant feature of this area is  
 the village of{EGLINTON}which lies    
 adjacent to{LOUGH FOYLE}, 7 miles east
 from the county town of{LONDONDERRY}  
 and 10 miles west of{LIMAVADY.}       
 The village has a long wide tree-lined
 main street which contains the main   
 shops, bank, Post Office and Health   
 Centre.                               
 The surrounding area is very fertile  
 and the land is enclosed for farming. 
{Dairy farming}and{mixed farming}are   
 carried on quite extensively.         
 Recently the village has begun to     
 expand and some of the land is being  
 sold off for the development of       
 private housing. Many of the local    
 inhabitants are employed by the       
 American Dupont Company, which makes  
 synthetic rubber, neoprene and lycra  
 stretch fabric.                       
                                       </content>
