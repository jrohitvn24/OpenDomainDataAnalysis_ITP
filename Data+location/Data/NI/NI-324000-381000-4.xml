		<title>04INTERVIEWS AT ROUGHFORT</title>
		<content>   We interviewed the two owners at {  
{LINFORD FARM}whose surnames were the{ 
 Mawhinney's.They have lived in the    
 area since they were born. They are   
 attracted to the area because it is so
 quiet and none of the folk would      
 change life in the country for life in
 a town. They use their car to obtain  
 their food.                           
   After interviewing the owner of{    
{Kilgreel House},an elderly lady,we    
 discovered that it had been built by  
 her great grandfather.                
   {Barley Hill} has had two previous  
 owners, but the present owner has     
 lived there for six years and during  
 this time the farmhouse and outer     
 buildings had been rebuilt. More      
 modern facilities were also           
 installed during the process of       
 improving the farm techniques. also   
 more advanced machinery was used.     </content>
