		<title>03FAMILY LIFE</title>
		<content> In common with other areas family life
 is presently being upset by the       
{breakdown of marriages:but}many homes 
 retain a settled pattern.One parent   
 families are quite common - step      
 parents are another feature of family 
 life in this area.                    
 Family{size}may range from 2 persons  
 up to as many as 12 persons.Some      
 families have grand-parents living    
 with them.Other families are comprised
 of young teenage couples who already  
 have children.                        
 Families eat at least 1{meal}together 
 daily:usually meat,vegetables and of  
 course potatoes.                      
{Pets}are very common especially       
 hamsters,budgies and dogs.            
 Home{entertainment}focuses on the     
 television and video recorder.Family  
 and social interaction may suffer     
 thereby.                              </content>
