		<title>17A DAY AT THE MAZE RACECOURSE</title>
		<content>{A day at the Maze races.}The day      
 begins very early for the trainers    
 stable boys and stewards .They have to
 prepare the horses for the races. For 
 the 'punter'the day starts about an   
 hour before the race. Admission for   
 adults is three pounds fifty          
 pence.Programmes for the races are on 
 sale and cost one pound. There is a   
 new paddock where you can watch the   
 horses being led around by their      
 stable boys before each race. 'Bookies
 from all over come to give 'odds' on  
 each race.They put up the names of the
 horses and the 'price'.As well as     
 these 'bookies' there is also the     
 'tote'.It is a system of betting in   
 which the total amount staked is      
 divided among the winners in          
 proportion to the size of their stake.
