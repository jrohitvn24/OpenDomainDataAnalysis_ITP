		<content> In the summer time our village always 
 has a{Community Week}in which most of 
 the people are involved. Some of the  
 events are: a fancy dress parade,     
 ladies hockey match, civic queen      
 contest, ladies football match, 13    
 mile cycle race, welly boot throwing, 
 horse shoe throwing, tug_o_war, junior
 fishing and junior motor cycle        
 scrambling. There is also an Old      
 Crocks v Under 13 football match, UDR 
 display and "It's a Knock Out", in    
 which each street enters a team. There
 is also junior sports and a talent    
 contest. On the last night there is a 
 disco in the marquee, run by the local
 police. All this goes on in a field   
 called Paddy's Park which is owned by 
{Ballymoney Borough Council.           
 Refreshments are on sale in the       
 marquee.
