		<title>20HARVEY'S - A WORKING MUSEUM</title>
		<content> The group who surveyed this block     
 found their visit to Mr Harvey's Saw- 
 and Scutch- Mills in Kilwaughter, the 
 most interesting of all. They found,  
 hidden away in a country lane,        
 historical workshops, still being     
 operated by a man whose grandfather   
 and father had done the same work - a 
 man with skill in his hands, and a    
 deep desire to preserve what could be 
 regarded as a Working Museum. Many    
 governments would support such devot- 
 ion, and we think that Mr Harvey      
 deserves to be sponsored and assisted 
 in maintaining a building and work of 
 great Historical Interest.            
 This survey has greatly helped the    
 pupils of Primary 7, Larne &amp; Inver    
 Primary School, 1984-5, in better     
 understanding the locality where they 
 live, the history of their families,  
 and why life is as it now is, here!   </content>
