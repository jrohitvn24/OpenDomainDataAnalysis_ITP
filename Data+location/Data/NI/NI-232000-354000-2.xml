		<content>This block is{ sparsely populated} as  
it is mainly in the country where the  
houses are mainly farmhouses. The main 
concentration of housing is in the     
village of Trillick. There are two     
{housing estates} in Trillick, Woodview
Crescent and Brunt Terrace which have  
been built by the Housing Executive of 
Northern Ireland.                      
{Woodview Crescent} is situated just   
off the Main Street beside the Primary 
School. It contains nineteen           
two-storeyed houses, eleven            
single-storeyed houses and four flats. 
There is a park nearby.                
{Brunt Terrace} is situated close to   
the Main Street and consists of twelve 
single-storeyed houses each with a     
small garden at the front.             
There is no great demand for private   
housing but there are some houses in   
the Main Street.                       </content>
