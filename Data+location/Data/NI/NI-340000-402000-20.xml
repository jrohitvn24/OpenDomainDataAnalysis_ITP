		<content> This contribution has been made by    
 members of P7 class of Olderfleet     
 Primary School.                       
 This is our last week together, for   
 next term our members will be going to
 at least four different secondary     
 schools.                              
 As a final celebration of life in     
 Olderfleet, we invited our parents to 
 a reception in the school hall. Sixty 
 two people were entertained to a      
 buffet meal which was prepared and    
 served by the class members.          
 The meal comprised chicken and ham    
 with various salads and dressings,    
 trifle, coffee and grape juice to     
 drink.                                
 The entertainment was based on the    
 television chat show 'Wogan', and the 
 guests were members of staff,         
 impersonated by the boys in the class.
