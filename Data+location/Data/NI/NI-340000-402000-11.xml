		<content> A cow in prime condition will produce 
 up to 40 litres of milk each day.     
 Such a cow could fetch Â£600 in the    
 market. The farmer buys his cattle at 
 Ballyclare, a small market town about 
 20km away. There is also a cattle     
 market at Larne, but the journey      
 around Larne Lough means in fact that 
 Ballyclare is nearer.                 
 The children on the farm witness the  
 same kind of geographical problem when
 it comes to their secondary school,   
 because in order to reach Larne, they 
 must either cross Larne Lough on the  
 Ferry, just over five minutes in a    
 little open boat, or go around the    
 promontory by car or bus.             
 On the farm, silage is produced for   
 winter feeding, supplimented by some  
 hay which is bought in.
