		<title>17INDUSTRY A JOINERY SHOP</title>
		<content> We interviewed Mr White.He is a joiner
 and he owns a wood working factory.He 
 sells windows and doors which he makes
 in his factory.He also sells all the  
 materials needed in house building    
 like wood,cement,nails,paint and other
 fittings.He has fourteen{employees    
 working for him in his factory.Most of
 Mr Whites mahogany wood comes from    
 Africa and his white wood comes from  
 Canada.Most people now use mahogany   
 wood for doors and windows because it 
 is harder and lasts longer.In his     
 factory it is noisy.This is caused by 
 his big{machines.}The men are busy    
 working with electric planes,saws and 
 morticing machines.There is a big     
 stove which warms the men in winter.It
 also burns the old wood which is of no
 use.Inside the{factory}it is very     
 dusty with all the sawdust.The goods  
 are sold in the Tyrone/Fermanagh area.</content>
