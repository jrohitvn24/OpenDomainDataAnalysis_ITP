		<content> Camphill forty years ago was quite a  
 different place from what it is now.  
 Smaller houses. Hardly any TV aerials 
 and not quite so many pylons as we see
 today.  There was no school until     
 l8 years ago.  Until then children    
 attended the old Public Elementary    
 School at Tullygarley, you can see it 
 marked on old maps, this has now been 
 demolished.  During the past forty    
 years the houses around the school and
 the school itself have come into      
 existence.  Now we have Camphill Park,
 Carolhill Park and Hollybank housing  
 estates.  Fifty two years ago there   
 was only one house near Camphill, now 
 there are over one hundred houses.
