		<title>06CLEANING  THE BYRE</title>
		<content> I{Slammed shut}the back door ,walked  
 over to the byre to the manure heap   
 where the barrow was.The navvy was    
 lying on the ground.There had been    
 a {frost last night and it was stuck  
{tight, }A good kick  sent it{careering
{over the yard}.I heaved up the barrow,
 found the brush in the garage along   
 with the grape and into the barrow    
 they went.Getting the navvy I started 
 to push it along the ground making a  
 scraping noise.I put it into the      
 barrow and walked over to the byre.As 
 I opened the door and switched on the 
 light I was met with a{chorus of moos.
 I started from the back and worked    
 downwards.It was a nice morning and   
{the sun sent its beams}through the    
 window, making{patches of white}in the
 dark corners of the byre.I put the    
 navvy down and used the grape to pile 
 the dung into the barrow.             </content>
