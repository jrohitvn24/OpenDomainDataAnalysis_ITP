		<title>17This Area 50 Years On</title>
		<content> Our class of thirty pupils conducted a
 survey of parents into what they      
 thought would happen to this area in  
 the next fifty years.This is what they
 thought.                              
      Old houses would be knocked down 
 and modern houses built,the modern    
 houses will be heated by solar        
 heating.They thought recreation halls 
 and entertainment for young people    
 would be built.People thought Kells   
 would expand into a town and it would 
 have better shopping facilities,a     
 library,a larger school and a health  
 centre.They also thought the Dying    
 factory and the Woollen Mill would    
 close down.                           
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
