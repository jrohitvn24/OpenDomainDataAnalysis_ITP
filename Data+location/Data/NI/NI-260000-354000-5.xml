		<title>05DAIRY FARMING</title>
		<content> Dairy farming is the most common type 
 of farming in the Lisdoart area. One  
 farmer interviewed, owned one hundred 
 acres of land and milked fifty five   
 cows twice a day. He had his own bull 
 and reared his own calves. He was     
 cutting silage while we were there to 
 feed cattle in winter. Farmers also   
 cut hay for winter feed. Another      
 farmer interviewed was Sean Mc Kenna. 
 He owns forty acres and has twenty    
 fresian cows. Fresian cows are the    
 best breed for dairy produce. The     
 dairy farmers mostly sell their milk  
 to the creameries who collect the milk
 in tankers each morning.
