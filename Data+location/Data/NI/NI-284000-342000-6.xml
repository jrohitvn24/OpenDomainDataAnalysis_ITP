		<content> There is also an old farm beside      
 the mill.This used to be a big        
 important farm but now it is not being
 used at all. Back in the 1970's it was
 being used a lot with mostly          
 cattle.Some of the 350 acres was used 
 for silage.                           
   The{MANOR HOUSE  SCHOOL }outside {  
{MILFORD,}which was once a private     
 girl's boarding school, has in recent 
 years become a home for mentally and  
 physically handicapped children.At one
 time this school  provided the young  
 ladies of the area with an extensive  
 education.However with changing trends
 in education it eventually closed,    
 was taken over by the health service  
 and made into a school for those      
 children unable to attend normal      
 school.
