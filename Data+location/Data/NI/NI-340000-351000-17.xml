		<content> There are two newspapers serving our  
 vicinity.One in Downpatrick and the   
 other centred in Newcastle.The        
 newspaper in Downpatrick is called the
 Down Recorder.It reports on Co. Down  
 while the newspaper in Newcastle      
 called the Mourne Observer reports    
 news in the Mourne District.The Down  
 Recorder started in 1836 and          
 is probably the oldest newspaper      
 around the district.They have two     
 offices,one in Downpatrick where the  
 reporters are and one in Portadown    
 where they do their printing.They have
 20 employees in Downpatrick and more  
 in Portadown.Their business is        
 expanding.The Mourne Observer has a   
 larger readership than the Down       
 Recorder.It started in 1949 and has   
 one office in Newcastle.They have     
 twice as many employees as the Down   
 Recorder.                             </content>
