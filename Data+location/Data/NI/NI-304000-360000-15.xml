		<title>15A day in the life of Aileen</title>
		<content>  My day usually starts at 8.00,when   
 my mother calls me for my breakfast of
 tea and toast.After getting ready for 
 school my mother brings me and my     
 sister to school in the car.The school
 is about 1.5 miles from the house.    
  The bell rings at 9.15,when we go    
 into the classroom.We spend the       
 morning doing maths,English,geography,
 drama and singing.We have a short     
 break at 10.50 and lunch lasts from   
 12.45 until 1.30.                     
  The boys usually play football,but   
 the girls' favourite game is rounders.
 In this game there are two teams.You  
 score a round by hitting the ball as  
 far away as possible and running round
 four markers before the other team can
 get the ball and hit the marker to    
 which you are running.                
  After lunch we get our homework and  
 go to the swimming pool.More- Page 16 </content>
