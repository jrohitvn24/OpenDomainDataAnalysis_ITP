		<title>13THE POLICE FORCE IN LIMAVADY</title>
		<content> The Royal Ulster Constabulary has many
 roles apart from maintaining law and  
 order.  Our new imposing police       
 station, opened in 1980, is           
 responsible for{traffic control, crime
{prevention}and{community work.        
 We especially enjoy the community     
 branch who sometimes assist at our    
 local discos and run regular "Blue    
 Lamp" discos for teenagers.  The local
 community policemen are familiar      
 figures who visit the elderly and take
 parties of children on summer         
 adventure holidays.  An important part
 of our school calender is the{Causeway
{Coast Ramble}which operates three     
 stages of difficulty.  Our RUC        
 community policemen are responsible   
 for encouraging young people to make  
 the most of their natural abilities.  
 The RUC community police are a real   
 part of our community in 1985.        </content>
