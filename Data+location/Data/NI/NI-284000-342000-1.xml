		<content> The area studied lies just south west 
 of {Armagh city}.It is predominantly  
 an agricutlural region with dispersed 
 farms scattered throughout. The       
 only settlement of any importance is  
 the village of {Milford }although     
 several small hamlets such as{Umgola} 
 are in evidence.                      
   Milford's dominant feature is the   
 mill which was established by the {   
 McCrum family in the early 1800s.This 
 led to the growth of the village and  
 employment for the people of the area 
 who hitherto were dependent on        
 farming.However ,the recession and    
 decline of the textile industry led to
 the closure of the mill in 1980.The   
 surrounding farmland is not the most  
 prosperous.Farming tends to be        
 pastoral in nature providing the local
 area with dairy products, beef or     
 lamb.                                 </content>
