		<content> A day in the life of a Ballycraigy    
 Primary School pupil.                 
 I rise at 8 o'clock, wash and put on  
 my white jump suit with turned up     
 sleeves.  Breakfast consists of       
 cornflakes, toast and a drink of juice
 while I watch Breakfast T.V.  We      
 leave for school at 0850 hrs., mum and
 dad have already left for work.{School
 starts at 09l0 hrs. with assembly, we 
 work to break at l045 hrs. when I eat 
 crisps and have a drink. Work         
 continues to dinner time, school      
 lunches are poor so I go home for     
 lunch of yoghurt and sandwiches.      
 After lunch school work continues but 
 we have games for boys and girls as   
 well as needlework and handwork.  On  
 arriving home at l520 hrs. I often go 
 to the shops for mum and play with    
 friends.  As soon as dad comes home we
 have tea together and watch T.V.      </content>
