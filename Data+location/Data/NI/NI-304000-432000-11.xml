		<title>11McCONACHIE'S MILL</title>
		<content>  Mc Conachie's mill is a large old    
 flax mill and it is now used to       
 crush various meals for local farmers.
 I get a mixture for my rabbits.       
 It used to be an old flax mill and our
 caretaker worked in it during the war.
 It had got a water wheel but it is not
 there any longer but you can open a   
 gate and the water runs down where the
 wheel used to be. There is a weir     
 beside the mill and a little slipway  
 for the Trout and Salmon to go up and 
 down and also there is a place to go  
 swimming in and it is where the water 
 goes through and flows down to where  
 the old water wheel used to be. Lots  
 of children enjoy swimming and fishing
 here in the summer.                   
  Mr McConachie told us that he might  
 start processing flax again in the    
 next year or two.
