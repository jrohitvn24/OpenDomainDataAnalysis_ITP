		<title>03THE FARM KITCHEN</title>
		<content> In this area, the{back door}is always 
 used. In some farmhouses the front    
 door has not been used for years. It  
 is used for{funerals}and {weddings.}  
 Since all activity takes place within 
 the{"hollow rectangle", }the front    
 door is too far away to be used. The  
 typical kitchen is square; large,     
 bright, and full of activity. There   
 the food is made, is eaten, and as    
 well as the ordinary kitchen work, it 
 is the main living room for the       
 family. The T.V. is usually there.    
 Even the sickly lamb can be found in a
 box beside the range. You will find a 
 coal-burning, closed range; an        
 electric cooker; fridge; freezer; a   
 table in the centre; chairs (including
 easy chairs for the evening). The     
 farmer's wife rules in her kitchen,   
 where her word is law. The kitchen is 
 the heart of the farm.                </content>
