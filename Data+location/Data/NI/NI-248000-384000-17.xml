		<title>17        THE BURN WALK</title>
		<content>                                       
 The{Burn Walk}is about a mile         
 long.There are eight or nine bridges  
 up the Burn.It is called the Burn Walk
 because it is along side Gortin Burn. 
 There is a cattle grid up the Burn so 
 that the goats and sheep will not get 
 down to the Main Street.              
    All the hills up the Burn Walk are 
 very steep.Most of the trees are very 
 jagged and most of the Burn Walk is   
 very stoney. When I go up the Burn for
 a walk on a summer's day I put my feet
 in the water. When I take them out    
 again they are very cold.             
   The Burn Walk  has about twenty     
 four steps. When you come to the      
 middle of it you have to cross a      
 fence. You have to cross the fence so 
 that the goat will not come after you.
   The Burn Walk is part of the Ulster 
 Way.                                  </content>
