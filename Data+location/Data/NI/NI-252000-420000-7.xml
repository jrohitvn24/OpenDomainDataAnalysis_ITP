		<title>07THE SUNDAY MARKET</title>
		<content> The Sunday Market is held in the      
 Longfield area from 2pm to 5pm. The   
 traders erect stalls and display their
 goods but some sell from the back of  
 vans. A large variety of items are    
 sold and the salesmen shout out the   
 prices in loud voices in order to     
 attract the customers' attention. Some
 of the goods are not of a good quality
 but others such as spotlights and car 
 engine parts are good value and       
 bargains can be had.                  
 The pet stall is very popular with the
 children and goldfish and turtles can 
 be bought cheaply. There are also     
 hardware stalls, toy stalls and many  
 clothes stalls which are owned by     
 coloured people from India and        
 Pakistan.
