		<title>02THE HOUSES OF GREENISLAND.</title>
		<content>  Greenisland's first houses were very 
 grand and belonged to{rich mill owners
 from Belfast who built on prestigious 
 sites overlooking Belfast Lough.      
  With the advent of railways and villa
 tickets(1862) the{professional classes
 built houses on the 3 main roads      
 within reach of the railway station.  
  In 1938 the local school was moved   
 from Trooperslane to Greenisland and  
 in 1956 the N.I. Housing Trust built  
 an estate to accommodate the{overflow 
{from Belfast}and to house the{workers 
{in the new textile factories}built    
 near Carrickfergus(Courtauld's and ICI
 _both since closed in 1980's causing  
 economic hardship).Alongside,private  
 estates were built for occupation by  
{middle management}of these factories. 
  To this day,because it is a pleasant 
 place to live,private houses are being
 built on every available site.        </content>
