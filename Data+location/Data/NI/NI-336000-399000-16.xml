		<title>16EDUCATION IN KILWAUGHTER</title>
		<content> The little white-washed cottage on the
 roadside is a home now, but the       
 inscription over the door states{     
{"KILWAUGHTER FEMALE NATIONAL SCHOOL   
{1810"}(The great-great-great          
 grandfather of a girl compiling this  
 page founded this as a Sunday School).
 The changeover was made in 1897, when 
 a two-room schoolhouse was built. The 
 inscription above it says{"COUNTESS   
{BALZANI MEMORIAL NATIONAL SCHOOL 1897"
 This is perhaps the only Irish school 
 with an Italian name. The local land- 
 owner was{Squire Agnew}of Kilwaughter.
 His daughter married an Italian Count,
 named Balzani. During the 1939-45 War,
 because the Balzanis were aliens, the 
 land transferred to the family farming
 there. Two years ago, the{AGNEW-      
{BALZANI}School was closed, due to     
 decreasing enrolment, and the pupils  
 were transferred to{MILLBROOK P. S.}  </content>
