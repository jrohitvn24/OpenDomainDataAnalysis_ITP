		<content> Much of the conservation work         
 currently done in the Mournes concerns
 access, path maintenance and routeing,
 and wall and stile building. Liason   
 between government bodies and local   
 landowners and land-users is done by  
 the Warden of Mourne who assesses and 
 coordinates activities such as are    
 done by the Conservation Volunteers.  
 This includes channelling walkers to  
 main paths.Work is in hand to substan-
 tially repair the Mourne Wall.        
 The Warden of Mourne also has an      
 educational role and gives talks to   
 schools, etc.                         
 Considerable use of the Mournes is    
 made by educational groups such as    
 Outdoor Pursuits Centres (climbing,   
 walking, orienteering, etc) and Field 
 Study Centres (Geographical,          
 Biological and Geological fieldwork). 
 Conservation is stressed to all.      </content>
