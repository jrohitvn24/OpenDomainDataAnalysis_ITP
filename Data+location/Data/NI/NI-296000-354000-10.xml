		<content> Then there are cattle being fattened  
 for{beef.}When ready,they are sent to 
 local abattoirs. The meat may be      
 marketed fresh,it may be exported,or  
 it may be used in a Portadown         
 meat-processing factory where it is   
 either canned or made into meat       
 products.                             
 Also in the survey area there is a    
 small number of sheep,and some        
 free-range pigs may be seen "rooting" 
 on rough ground.                      
 Individual farmers have their own     
 enterprises according to what suits   
 them and their conditions. Some       
 farmers sell "dropped" calves at one  
 or two weeks old,another farmer may   
 rear them and possibly even a third   
 may fatten them. One man may keep a   
 few sows,rear the piglets till they   
 are weaned,then sell them to be       
 fattened on another farm.             </content>
