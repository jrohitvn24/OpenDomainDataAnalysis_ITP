		<content>  If a child is born on Whit Sunday, it
 is said that such a person will become
 dangerous and take a life.To nullify  
 this we have heard of people killing a
 chicken in the hands of an infant born
 on this day.On New Year's Day,there   
 are some people who do not care to see
 any person outside their own household
 enter the house on that day _ a red   
 headed woman particularly,but it is   
 considered lucky for a dark person to 
 be the first to enter.Men have been   
 known to turn back from a journey when
 they met a red _ headed woman within  
 the first three miles.It is unlucky to
 take a cat with a flitting and no     
 beggar should be turned away from the 
 door empty handed.If you say aloud    
 that you mean to exterminate rats, the
 rats will not touch the traps,and at  
 midnight on Christmas Eve,an ass bends
 on its forelegs in memory of Bethlehem</content>
