		<title>11HARLAND AND WOLFF</title>
		<content> Harland and Wolff has been in         
 existence in East Belfast since 1853  
 when the iron ship building yard of   
 Robert Hickson was laid out on Queen's
 Island.Edward Harland bought the yard 
 in 1858 and together with Gustav Wolff
 made it famous throughout the world.  
 Many famous ships have been           
 constructed here.In 1912 the "Titanic"
 was completed only to sink on her     
 maiden voyage after striking an       
 iceberg in mid-Atlantic.Many fine     
 ships were built during the World Wars
 and afterwards they continued this    
 tradition by building among others the
 famous passenger liner "Canberra"and  
 the North Sea oil drilling rig "Sea   
 Quest".Following a vast modernisation 
 programme Harland and Wolff is today  
 the most up to date ship-yard in the  
 world with the largest building dock  
 and crane in existence.               </content>
