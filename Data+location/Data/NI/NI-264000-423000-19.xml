		<title>19LIMAVADY FIRE STATION</title>
		<content> On a Wednesday in Limavady don't be   
 alarmed if you hear the sound of a    
 fire siren _ it's  probably just the  
 regular practice night for the local  
 fire station.                         
 The fire-fighting force consists of   
 approximately{twenty part-time firemen
 who, are contacted by personal        
 bleepers in the case of an emergency. 
 The men are rarely called more than   
 twice a week.                         
 Mr Blair, the full time station       
 officer controls the two              
 water-carrying fire engines and is    
 often responsible for ensuring that   
 Limavady Brigade are on standby in the
 city of Londonderry for any expected  
 emergency.                            
 Each fireman has two uniforms, one for
 a parade and the other for normal     
 duty.                                 
                                       </content>
