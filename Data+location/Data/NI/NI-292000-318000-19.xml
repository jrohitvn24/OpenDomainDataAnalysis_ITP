		<content> During the long winter nights, the men
 very often assemble to play cards     
 either in the Community Centre or in  
 someone's home.They play for money, or
 perhaps a turkey or goose.In summer,  
 they play skittles,a game similar to  
 bowls.There is a Ladies'Night each    
 week in the Community Centre,where    
 they have Cookery Demonstrations,     
 Floral Arrangement,First Aid,         
 Needlework,etc.The Senior Citizens    
 have a coffee morning once a week,and 
 there is a disco at the week-end for  
 the teenagers of the area.There is a  
 small pub in the village,but it can   
 only accomodate twenty people.Since   
 these are the only forms of           
 entertainment in the area,it is       
 necessary,therefore,for the people to 
 travel elsewhere _ mainly to Dundalk  
 or Castleblaney,where they can see    
 films,go dancing,play Bingo,etc.      </content>
