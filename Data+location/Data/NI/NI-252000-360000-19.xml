		<content> We conducted a survey on where sixteen
 catholic families from this district  
 go on their summer holidays.Ten       
 families went to Bundoran.Two families
 went to Wicklow,one family went to    
 Dublin,one went to Galway,one went to 
 Sligo and one went to North West      
 Donegal.Six families stayed in a      
{caravan}, six stayed in a rented house
 one stayed in a hotel and three only  
 went for a day.Most people look       
 forward to relaxing on the{beach}and  
 the children look forward to the slot 
 machines and rides on electric cars.  
 The protestant families usually go to 
 Portrush or Portstewart and some also 
 go to Scotland.Very few families      
 around this district go abroad for the
 holidays.Many people from the district
 go on a{pilgrimage}to Knock to Lough  
 Derg and afew go to Lourdes in France.
