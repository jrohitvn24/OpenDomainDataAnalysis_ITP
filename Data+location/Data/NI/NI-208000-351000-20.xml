		<title>20THE SILLIES RIVER</title>
		<content> The Sillies river, in its ten miles   
 and more of twisted course, from its  
 source at Bunnahone to the Erne, flows
 through the little village of         
 Derrygonnelly where it kept three     
 mills a-turning for many a year.      
 Leaving the village it slows down     
 along ground that is too level till it
 grows sluggish and sometimes floods   
 the long valley below.                
                       In recent times 
 many thousands of pounds  have been   
 spent by the Drainage Board on        
 draining the river with some success, 
 by cleaning and deepening it but not  
 "meddling" with its course.According  
 to the legend connected with St.Faber 
 it has been deemed unlucky to meddle  
 with the flow of the river.           
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
