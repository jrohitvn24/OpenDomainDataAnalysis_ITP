		<title>11Education in Ballywalter</title>
		<content>    Ballywalter Primary School was     
 built in l93l but was renovated just  
 three years ago and is now very       
 modern. There are l36 children and 5  
 teachers. The children are from four  
 to eleven years of age. When children 
 are eleven years old they do a        
 selection test to see which school    
 they go to - usually either Regent    
 House Grammar School or Glastry High  
 School.                               
    Before you are the age to start    
 school i.e. four and younger you can  
 go to a play group that is run by the 
 mothers in the Prochial Hall. There   
 used to be two schools, one for       
 infants and the other for seniors, but
 they were closed when this school was 
 built.                                
    One school which was shut is now   
 called the Parochial Hall. It was     
 built by Lord Dunleath.               </content>
