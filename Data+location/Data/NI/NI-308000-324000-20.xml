		<title>20TRADE IN NEWRY.</title>
		<content> The Newry market has been going since 
 1550.It was held every Thursday from  
 the time of the Monastery,but with the
 coming of Bagenal it was confirmed by 
 royal favour.Today Newry market deals 
 in clothing,footwear,hardware,fruit   
 and vegetables.Formerly hay and cattle
 were sold at the market.There are     
 about one hundred and forty-six stalls
 in Newry market.On Thursdays and      
 Saturdays Newry market still carries  
 on the tradition of selling all the   
 different goods.The stalls used to be 
 open stalls,but now they are covered  
 with perspex.A few years ago a        
 hyper-mart was to be built on the     
 Industrial Estate but the local       
 council turned down this proposal as  
 it would have taken trade from the    
 centre of the town and left the       
 town-centre "dead".
