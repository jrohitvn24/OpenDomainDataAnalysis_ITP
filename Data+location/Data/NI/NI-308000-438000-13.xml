		<content> During recent years the {Moyle        
{District Council}has gained a         
 reputation in Northern Ireland as a   
 council where all members worked      
 together for the good of the people   
 without any regard for party political
 differences. However at the last      
 election both{ Sinn Fein}and the{     
{D.U.P.}both succeeded in getting      
 members elected. As a result there has
 been an upsurge of more bad feeling   
 among local councillors.              
 Unfortunately for the local people    
 this has led to increasing            
 polarisation and perhaps the          
 reputation which the council formerly 
 held will now disappear. This is just 
 an indication of how politics in      
 Northern Ireland are going at present.
