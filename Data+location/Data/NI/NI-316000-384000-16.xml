		<content> Apart from the Farms on the block     
 there is only one main source of      
 employment on the block and that is   
 Muckamore Abbey Hospital.  This       
 provides employment for males and     
 females as nurses, ancillary workers  
 and drivers.  There are also some     
 small Factory Warehouse complexesss   
 using old mills along the Six Mile    
 Water for premises and also some      
 around the motorway links towards the 
 north of the block.                   
 The main sources for employment       
 further afield was a large textile    
 factory 'Enkalon', and the tyre       
 factory 'Michelin', but both have     
 closed and people have to travel      
 further afield for employment.  One   
 advantage of this area is its         
 proximity to Aldergrove Airport which 
 is a source of employment for many in 
 the area.                             </content>
