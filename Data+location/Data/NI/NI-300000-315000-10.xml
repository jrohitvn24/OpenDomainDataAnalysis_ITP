		<title>10SCHOOL LIFE CONTD.</title>
		<content> Since Granny's day there have been a  
 lot of changes. Today the atmosphere  
 in school is much more pleasant and   
 relaxed. Discipline is not so         
 severe,the writing slate and chalk    
 have disappeared and we do not have to
 take a sod of turf with us for the    
 fire.Our schools are modern buildings 
 with central heating and electricity -
{Dromintee Primary}was modernised in{  
{1966}- and equipped with{televisions,}
{computers,photocopiers,}and a large   
 stock of{reading &amp; reference books.   
 We don't have to buy any books as the 
 school is given an amount of money by 
 the{S.E.L.Board}to purchase all books 
 &amp; materials needed.{The mobile library
 visits the school every term to change
 our supply of reading books.A very    
 enjoyable feature of school life today
 is the{Educational Outing}which       
 enables us to visit interesting places</content>
