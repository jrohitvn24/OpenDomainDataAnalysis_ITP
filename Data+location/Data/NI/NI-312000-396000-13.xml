		<title>13My Free Time</title>
		<content> In my free time I read books and do   
 puzzles. I read books out from the    
 Bookworm Club. Sometimes I might do   
 jig saw puzzles. If they are too hard 
 I would leave them for daddy to do.   
 When it is a nice day,I would get my  
 bike and go for a ride, or sometimes I
 might get my skipping rope and skip.  
 Sometimes in my freetime,I would clean
 my silver spoon and count my postcards
 When it is nice and sunny day,I would 
 ride my pony. I would take it for long
 walks. If it was a really hot summers 
 day, I would lie out and get sunburnt.
 Or if I was up my garden, I would have
 a swing on my swings. If mummy was    
 baking, I would help her to bake. But 
 I alway get into a mess. Then I would 
 get my roller boots and skate around  
 the outside of my house. But I always 
 fall and hurt myself.
