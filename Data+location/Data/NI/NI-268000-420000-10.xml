		<title>10MARKET DAY</title>
		<content> On market day daddy rises early to    
 load the trailor with the sheep he    
 wants to sell.  After a quick cup of  
 tea and toast he sets off for Limavady
 Mart.  A lot of other farmers seem to 
 have the same idea because when he    
 arrives there is usually a long queue 
 of tractors and lorries waiting to    
 unload.  The animals are packed into  
 pens and marked to distinguish them   
 from any others sharing the same pen. 
 The sheep are brought into the market 
 ring in lots of 4 or 5 and sold by    
 auction.  A few days later daddy can  
 call into the auctioneer's office for 
 his money.  Sometimes daddy will buy  
 sheep on the same day and these have  
 to be paid for.  The auctioneer       
 charges a fee for his services.  There
 are separate days for the sale of     
 cattle.
