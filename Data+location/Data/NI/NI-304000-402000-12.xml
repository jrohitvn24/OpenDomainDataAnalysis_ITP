		<title>12GALGORM PLAYGROUP</title>
		<content>  On arrival at the playgroup we were  
 greeted by Mrs. Gamble who told us to 
 make ourselves at home.               
  The children were working with       
 plasticine,making jigsaws and building
 lego. We sat down at a table and mixed
 with the children who were very       
 friendly.                             
  On the walls of the room there were  
 coloured pictures the children had    
 made. At the bottom of the room there 
 was an imitation sink,cupboards, a    
 bed,a table and chairs where the      
 children played 'houses'.             
  At eleven o'clock the children were  
 lined up to go to the toilet. Then    
 they sat in a circle and were given   
 milk and biscuits. The children always
 do something, we helped them make     
 butterflies. After this is was story  
 time and the playgroup ended at half  
 past twelve.                          </content>
