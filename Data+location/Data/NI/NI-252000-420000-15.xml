		<title>15THE EQUESTRIAN CENTRE</title>
		<content> The Equestrian Centre was opened in   
 January 1981 to provide facilities to 
 promote the{training of horses and    
{riders.}The original building was 90  
 ft x 200ft but in 1982 this was       
 extended to 200 x 200ft. The overall  
 cost of the building was Â£58000 and   
 this was met by selling Â£500 shares.  
 Membership is on a family basis and   
 there are 75-85 families involved each
 paying an annual subscription of Â£20. 
 The centre is{used daily from         
{September to March}and there are      
 competitions every Wednesday, Saturday
 and Sunday. Competition fees are      
 another source of revenue. On average 
 about{100 horses and riders} use the  
 centre weekly and the club has hosted 
 an international indoor event. Trevor 
 Coyle (Irish International),Nigel and 
 Colin Smyth (1984 European Gold) and  
 Jackie Burns(1984 Eur.Bronze) use it. </content>
