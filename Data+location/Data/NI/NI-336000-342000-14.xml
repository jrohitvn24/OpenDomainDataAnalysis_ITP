		<title>14Ecology in Drumaroad area</title>
		<content> This rural grassland area is ideally  
 suited to supporting{bird}and{animal} 
 life with its proliferation of haw-   
 thorn hedges and grass earth banks as 
 field boundaries. Lately,many hedges  
 have been removed in making larger    
 fields but cover is still plentiful.  
 All native{birds}thrive including,on  
 marshy uplands, lapwings with herons  
 by the Moneycarragh River.{Rookeries} 
 are found in beech stands. The{rabbit 
 population rose rapidly as myxomatosis
 died out in 1980.Hares,foxes &amp; badgers
 are common.{Footpaths}around drumlins 
 are non-existent as public walks since
 old laneways are overgrown and only   
 used for access to farmers' fields as 
 required.This area lies in the rain-  
 shadow of Slieve Croob and has regular
 rainfall.Gales are frequent. Roadways 
 are at times{polluted}with rubbish and
 untidy verges in 1980s due to cutbacks</content>
