		<content>    The road network is the only means 
 of  transport  through the  area, but 
 earlier  this  century there were two 
{railway lines }passing  through. They 
 were {single track narrow-gauge}lines 
 from{Larne, branching  at  Ballyboley 
{Junction.}One travelled along the{Six 
{Mile Water }valley to  Ballyclare and 
 Doagh, while the  other made  its way 
 over and round the hills to{Ballymena.
{  }The lines were{opened in 1878,}and 
 although  they  carried  passengers , 
 their main income was from goods. The 
 Ballyclare line was very important to 
 the local{linen and  paper mills}as a 
 means of transporting  their products 
 to the  port of Larne. The  Ballymena 
 branch carried{iron ore}from quarries 
 in the Antrim hills to Larne.         
    The lines were  never a  financial 
 success and eventually{closed in 1940 
 when Ballyclare Paper Mill closed.    </content>
