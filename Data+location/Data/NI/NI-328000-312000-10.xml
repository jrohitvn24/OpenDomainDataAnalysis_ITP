		<content> GRANITE PRODUCTION IN KILKEEL IS      
 MAINLY DIRECTED TOWARDS THE           
 MONUMENTAL TRADE AND BUILDING         
 INDUSTRY.  THE MONUMENTS DIFFER IN    
 SIZE, SHAPE, COLOUR AND DEGREE OF     
 POLISH.  MORE THAN 60% OF THE WORK IS 
 SOLD IN ENGLAND, SCOTLAND AND WALES   
 WITH THE REMAINDER BEING CONSUMED BY  
 THE NORTHERN IRELAND MARKET.          
 THERE ARE A GREAT VARIETY OF COLOURS  
 AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMER AND THESE   
 COME FROM MANY COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT   
 THE WORLD.  THE MOST POPULAR COLOURS  
 ARE GREY AND BLACK FROM SOUTH AFRICA, 
 THEN BLACK, RED, GREEN, AND PINK FROM 
 NORWAY AND SWEDEN AND FINALLY A BLUE  
 GRANITE FROM FINLAND.  THERE ARE MANY 
 MORE COLOURS AND TYPES BUT THEY ARE   
 NOT AS POPULAR IN BRITAIN.  THE       
 GRANITE IS ORDERED IN BLOCK SIZES     
 SUITABLE FOR THE WAY IN WHICH THEY    
 ARE TO BE CUT.                        </content>
