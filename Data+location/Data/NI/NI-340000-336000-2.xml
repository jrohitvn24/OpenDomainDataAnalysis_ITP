		<title>02Inner Dundrum Bay</title>
		<content> The mudflats of the Inner Bay are     
 almost completely covered by High Tide
 and exposed at Low Tide. Green Island 
 at 411371 is always above High Water  
 and so is used as a main roost for    
 most of the wading bird and wildfowl  
 population of the North Inner Bay. The
 mudflats extend from the fringe of    
 saltmarsh and salt-tolerant grassland 
 down to the course of the River       
 Blackstaff and its tributary the      
 Ardilea. The saltmarsh fringe is      
 narrow (often less than 1m wide) and  
 in places is replaced by small pieces 
 of shale from the surrounding till.   
 The till also contains hard worm-tubes
 at 423388,perhaps indicating deeper   
 water at some stage. The salt marsh   
 ares are best exemplified by the area 
 West of the line of the old railway at
 417387, an area under threat of being 
 flooded to be used as a fish farm.    </content>
