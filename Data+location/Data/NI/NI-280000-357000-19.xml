		<title>19   Prince Andrew Crescent.</title>
		<content>  {Prince Andrew Crescent}is an estate 
 which was built in 1963.In{1964}the   
 tenants moved in.Prince Andrew        
 Crescent was named after{Prince Andrew
 who was born in{1963.}                
  In Prince Andrew Crescent there are  
{forty-four}houses and about{one       
{hundred and fifty}people living       
 there.The end houses have very large  
 gardens, and my granda who lives at   
 the end house mows his garden every   
 week and granny looks after the       
 flowers.                              
   At the bottom of Prince Andrew      
 Crescent is an{Orange Hall}which was  
 opened in 1960.My granda,Mr.Mckinley, 
 is a member of the{Orange Lodge.}     
    I think Prince Andrew Crescent is a
 lovely place to live and a very       
 beautiful housing estate.
