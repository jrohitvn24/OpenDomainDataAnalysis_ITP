		<content> Redmond O'Hanlon was born near        
 Poyntzpass in 1640.                   
 Numerous robberies in the Armagh Area 
 were linked to his name so that by    
 1676 notices were posted wanting him  
 "Dead Or Alive".                      
 There is a story of how a boy out     
 smarted him and stole his horse.  The 
 boy was travelling with a sack of     
 halfpence.  Redmond O'Hanlon held him 
 up thinking it was a sack of gold.    
 The boy promptly threw the sack into a
 thick bush.  While O'Hanlon searched  
 for the sack the boy rode off on      
 O'hanlon's horse.                     
 O'Hanlon was finally shot by a kinsman
 while he slept.  His head was put on a
 spike at Downpatrick Prison and his   
 body buried in a graveyard near       
 Scarva.
