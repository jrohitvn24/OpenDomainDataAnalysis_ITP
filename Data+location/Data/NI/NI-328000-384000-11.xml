        A Ballycraigy farmer's wife has
 a thriving{COTTAGE INDUSTRY.}She makes
 'coats' for horses and greyhounds.    
      She began by making her own coats
 for the hunters,showhorses and ponies 
 on the farm.None of the coat designs  
 on the market pleased her.Friends came
 to her asking for similar coats.      
        The industry has expanded from 
 her dining room table,to a loft in the
 farmyard,reached by outside steps.    
 Here are benches,heavy sewing machines
 and heaps of cloth and coats.         
 Several local ladies are employed.    
        Another{RURAL INDUSTRY}is found
 at 'Horse Cottage',as we christened it
 because of the horse pictures on the  
 gate.The family run a training stable,
 training racehorses for local owners. 
 One horse was going to England to race
 -going by cross-channel ferry.        </content>
