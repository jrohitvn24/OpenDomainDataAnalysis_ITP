		<content> (1)  CHANGES IN HOUSES.               
 EIGHTY YEARS AGO HOUSES AROUND        
 COOKSTOWN WERE ALL SIZES.  SMALL      
 HOUSES HAD ABOUT TWO OR THREE ROOMS.  
 NOW, ON THE MONEYMORE ROAD AND        
 COOLREAGHS ROAD THE HOUSES ARE VERY   
 GRAND.  THE RICHER PEOPLE LIVE IN THIS
 AREA OF THE TOWN.                     
 FORMERLY THERE WAS NOT ANY PIPED IN   
 WATER SUPPLY IN HOUSES AND SOME PEOPLE
 HAD TO WALK A QUARTER OF A MILE TO THE
 NEAREST WELL.  THE PEOPLE USED        
 OUT-SIDE TOILETS, OFTEN OVER A STREAM 
 AND THEY BATHED IN TIN-TUBS IN FRONT  
 OF THE FIRE.  THE HOUSES' ROOVES WERE 
 OFTEN MADE OF THATCH WHICH WAS BARLEY 
 OR WHEAT STRAW.  POOR PEOPLE USED     
 BENCHES TO SIT ON.                    
 NOWADAYS, THERE IS PIPED IN WATER AND 
 PEOPLE HAVE BATHROOMS AND TOILETS IN  
 THEIR HOUSES.
