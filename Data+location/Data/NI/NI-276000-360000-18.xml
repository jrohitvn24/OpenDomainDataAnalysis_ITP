		<title>18DUNGANNON POST OFFICE</title>
		<content> Work begins at 05.00 hours and the day
 is split into two seperate shifts of  
 work. The sorting office is open seven
 days a week while the men work five   
 days a week on a rota basis.          
  There are thirteen people employed in
 the front office.  Originally their   
 job was to sell postage stamps to the 
 general public. However over the range
 of services given by the post office  
 has increased dramaticaly. The post   
 office now operates its own banking   
 system, the Girobank. It also has a   
 savings bank and is involved in       
 selling Government Premium Bonds.     
 Motor tax discs can also be purchased 
 in the post office. One of its most   
 important functions is as agents for  
 the payment of government benefits.   
 Benefit payment books are sent out by 
 government agencies to the people     
 entitled to these benefits.           </content>
