		<title>07A TYPICAL FARM WORKER</title>
		<content>                                       
 My name is {Michael Callaghan}and I am
 employed as a general farm worker by {
{Mr Wilson,}who owns {Hillhead Farm.   
{         }Opportunities for employment
 in our area are so poor that I count  
 myself very lucky, especially as I am 
 very interested in this type of work. 
 Most general farm workers in{N.Ireland
 are family employees.                 
                 I have to do a range  
 of jobs around the farm including     
 everyday tasks like keeping buildings 
 and yards clean and tidy,carring out  
 maintenance but driving the tractor   
 and other machinery gives me the most 
 pleasure.                             
          {Mr.Wilson }is engaged in    
 draining a large area of land to make 
 it suitable to grow barley and this   
 means that there is plenty of         
 opportunity for driving.              </content>
