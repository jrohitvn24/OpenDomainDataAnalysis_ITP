		<content>                                       
 Hello my name is Joe Average and my   
 favourite day of the week is Saturday.
 I like Saturday because{I am off      
{school.}I usually get up at eight o'  
 clock and I spend my day doing a great
 variety of things. I am seldom bored. 
 Altogether I spend forty seven minutes
 eating throughout the day.In the      
 morning I enjoy a breakfast of        
 cornflakes with lots of sugar and milk
 and that takes me about five minutes  
 to eat. I prefer a light snack like   
 tomato soup for lunch which normally  
 takes me fifteen minutes to eat.For   
 dinner I like chips and curry which   
 takes me about twenty seven minutes to
 eat.                                  
   After breakfast I watch children's  
 programmes on television.Overall I    
 watch television for three hours and  
 twenty minutes during the day.        </content>
