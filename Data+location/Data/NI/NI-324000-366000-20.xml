		<content>  This "D-block" contains one kilometre
 square which was not surveyed.        
{(03270368)                            
 The text pages refer to this area only
 briefly and the data count for this   
 "D-block" is also incomplete for that 
 square.                               
  The reason for this is the presence  
 in that square of a large Housing     
 Estate called{Twinbrook}which,at the  
 time of survey,is the scene of civil  
 unrest.                               
                                       
  As much information as possible was  
 gleaned from directories etc...,and   
 was included but this information may 
 not be accurate and is incomplete.    
                                       
  Generally speaking,{Twinbrook}is more
 aligned with West Belfast than the    
 area in which it is situated.This     
 would include Education,Trade etc...  </content>
