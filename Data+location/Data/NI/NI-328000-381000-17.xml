		<title>17FARMING</title>
		<content>   About 50% of our area is taken up by
 good farmland. All the farms surveyed 
 were mainly dairy farms, Friesian     
 cattle as their main herd some kept a 
 few beef cattle. The Farms all had    
 modern machines to gain high          
 production and most milking parlours  
 were very modern.                     
   The Farms were worked by the        
 families with only one or two helpers 
 and most families had been there for  
 over 20 years.                        
   The land was almost totally pasture,
 cereals _ barley and potatoes, only   
 being grown in very small amounts for 
 animal food and cash crop.            
   All farmers used artifical          
 fertilizer on the grass to gain high  
 production and raised their own young 
 followers. No farms kept pigs, sheep, 
 horses, etc and some kept a few hens  
 for personal use.                     </content>
