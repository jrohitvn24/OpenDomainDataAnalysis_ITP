		<content>   This is mainly a low-lying area with
 some hills rising to a height of 218  
 feet.The main river is the Sillies    
 with its tributaries.Approximately    
 half of the village of Derrygonnelly  
 lies within this boundary.This area   
 also has its share of Fermanagh's well
 known "Lakeland",as parts of Carrick  
 Lough and Monawilkin Lough are also   
 included.                             
          The majority of the people   
 obtain a livelihood from dairy farming
 whilst the Department of Agriculture  
 (Forestry Division),Fermanagh Wood    
 Products and the Lough Erne Cheese    
 Manufacturers also provide employment.
                                    The
 area offers a few notable historical  
 features - a number of Raths,a Crannog
 on Carrick Lake and the oldest        
 graveyard in the locality beside
