 Most of the shop-keepers interviewed  
 were quite happy to have a business in
 this area.They liked the kind of      
 customers who used their shops but    
 complained of not being busy enough at
 times.Most also live in the area and  
 say that they are quite happy to do   
 so.In one area ,(Skyline Dr.)the      
 shop-keepers complained that not      
 enough was being done to deal with the
 litter problem around their shops.    
 Most said that the great majority of  
 their business was local and regular  
 and most admitted that the advent of  
 the large suburban supermarket had    
 done their trade no good at all.      
 They all agreed that their favourite  
 customers were ones with large        
 families! They all preferred talkative
 customers to quiet ones.
