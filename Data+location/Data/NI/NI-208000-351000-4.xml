		<title>04TULLYCARBRY FOREST</title>
		<content> This forest, which covers an area of  
 approximately 35 hectares, was planted
 by the Department of Agriculture      
 between 1959-62. Sitka Spruce and     
 Norway Spruce are the main types of   
 trees planted there.Sitka Spruce,a    
 native of Western North America, was  
 first introduced into Ireland in 1834.
 It yields a good quality whitish      
 coloured timber which is easily worked
 and strong.                           
           Norway Spruce, a native of  
 Central and Northern Europe, was first
 introduced into Ireland in 1700.It    
 grows rather more slowly than Sitka   
 but is more windfirm.Young Norway     
 Spruce are used for Christmas trees.  
           On reaching maturity, around
 the year 2000, the timber in this     
 forest will be used mostly for        
 chipboard, posts and fencing.
