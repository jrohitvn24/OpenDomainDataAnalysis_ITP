		<title>17A typical Family</title>
		<content>  {A typical family has three children.
{At the age of four the children begin 
{primary school which they attend until
{they are eleven. They then go to      
{Secondary School in Aughnacloy or a   
{Grammar School in Dungannon _ called  
{The Dungannon Royal School.           
{  In our area most mothers stay at    
{home although some do have part_time  
{jobs acting as home_help for elderly  
{people. }In most cases teenagers live 
 with their parents until they get     
 married.  They the set up a home of   
 their own.  Grandparents usally stay  
 with their daughters rather than got  
 into an old people's home.  The whole 
 family usually meet together for      
 breakfast and dinner in the evening   
 before going their own ways.          
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
