 area.There are some foxes in          
 it.Although they aren't seen very much
 they leave footprints and live in     
 earths.There are also badgers.They    
 are grey on their faces.A sett is dug 
 in the ground.A badgers sett can be   
 4-5 metres deep.They have sharp teeth 
 and claws.It eats rabbits.Rabbits are 
 quick on their feet and they also live
 in burrows.There are lots of wild     
 plants in the fields and hedges.The   
 daisy is one of our most common       
 flowers we have in our fields.It is   
 about 6 to 7 cm's high with white     
 petals and yellow in the middle.
