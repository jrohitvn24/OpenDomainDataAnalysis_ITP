		<title>10Antrim Police Station</title>
		<content>  We went on a visit to Antrim Police  
 Station and Sergeant Smith showed us  
 round. He gave us a talk in the police
 lecture room about police dogs that   
 sniffed out drugs and bombs.Next we   
 went to see the cells which were dark 
 and dreary with leather beds which    
 weren't very comfortable and with     
 chairs chained to the wall.Then we met
 a man who was in the Traffic Control  
 Unit which is a unit which tries to   
 stop speeding on roads and drinking   
 and driving.The man gave us a talk on 
 his job which was very interesting and
 he showed us some equipment.They use  
 very fast cars and B.M.W. motorbikes. 
 The cars and motorbikes are well      
 equipped with gadgets of all kinds.   
 Next we went to the computer office   
 which was full of computers,machines  
 and maps.                             
                                       </content>
