		<title>03The Strand at Portstewart</title>
		<content> People exploring in the sandhills have
 found flints. Historians have traced  
 these flints back to people of Middle 
 Stone Age. They lived along the edge  
 of the lower beach. Later the sand    
 dunes were formed and these were ideal
 sites for New Stone Age Man. Tools    
 have been found to show that they came
 to Portstewart in the salmon season.  
 Neolithic Man waded into the water and
 speared the fish or sometimes netted  
 them. He could not hunt at this time  
 as the trees and bushes were too      
 thick. People have found pieces of    
 pottery,human bones and stones to show
 that people lived along the edge of   
 the beach till mediaeval times.       
 A spring of water is at the east of   
 the beach. The well is known as       
 Tubberpatrick,since some people       
 believe St. Patrick came to           
 Portstewart and drank from it.        </content>
