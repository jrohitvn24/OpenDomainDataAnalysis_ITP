		<title>10A RECENT EVENT IN FINAGHY</title>
		<content> There have been two new blocks of     
 shops built in the Finaghy area in    
 1984. The new shops tell us something 
 about the way the lives of the people 
 in the area is changing. There is only
 one of the new shops which sells food 
 and that is a fruit and vegetable     
 shop. This is maybe because there are 
 already a lot of food shops in the    
 area. Except for two chemists and a   
 baby shop, all the other shops in the 
 new blocks sell something to do with  
 hobbies or leisure time. They are, a  
 pet shop, a florists, a DIY shop and a
 Video shop.                           
 When these shops were built they made 
 sure that there was space for parking 
 cars because more people come to shop 
 in cars these days. These shops are   
 also near to banks which have cash    
 points so that people can get money   
 when they need it.                    </content>
