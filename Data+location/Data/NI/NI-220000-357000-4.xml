		<content> At 8 o'clock my father goes out to the
 fields on his tractor and brings the  
 cows in.If the ground is wet he takes 
 the trike which is a three wheeled    
 motor bike with wide tyres.There are  
 sixty cows to milk.They are milked in 
 the byre where twelve cows can go in  
 at one time.There are two sides with  
 six in each.First the cow's udder is  
 washed with a hose.If the udder is    
 dirty it is rubbed with a clean cloth.
 The clusters of four milking cups are 
 placed on the cow's teats and the     
 vacuum holds them on.The cups have    
 liners inside and air causes these to 
 move in and out to simulate a calf    
 sucking or hand_milking.When the cows 
 are milked they move to the slatted   
 house.From May to September they go   
 out to the fields to graze.The cows   
 are milked again in the evenings.The  
 milk tanker collects in the morning.  </content>
