		<title>11DRAIN'S BAY</title>
		<content>{Drain's Bay, about 4km N of Larne,    
 consists of a garage, which also sells
 groceries and a group of houses built 
 in a strip along the road. Most of the
 houses are built on the land side of  
 the road, because the{Council don't   
{allow building on the seaward side.   
 There is also a hall used for church  
 services. For visitors there is a     
{carpark with toilets and a small play 
{area. The beach}has some patches of   
 sand, but is mostly covered with rocks
 and seaweed. A km along the road the  
 Council is developing a{country park ,
 while a{sandy beach}can be found a few
 km away{at Ballygally.}Drain's Bay is 
 popular with Sunday visitors.{Over 800
{cars per hr}can pass along this road  
 on a good day. When we asked what     
 improvements they would like to see,  
 they said a cleaner beach,a cafe and  
  shops and better play area for kids. </content>
