		<content> The recreation needs of the Donemana  
 people are catered for through the six
 halls in the village.One of these     
 halls belongs to the Council and it is
 badly in need of repairs'so therefore 
 it is out of use.The main activities  
 that take place in the other halls are
 _ bowls,discos and senior citizen     
 meetings.Youth clubs also meet two    
 nights weekly during the winter months
 and they participate in the following 
 activities_pool,snooker,darts,video   
 games,table tennis,hockey and         
 soccer.The senior citizens meet weekly
 and involve themselves in such skills 
 as knitting,sewing and baskerty.This  
 is the only group where Catholic and  
 Protestant meet together.There are    
 other seasonal activities such as     
 guest teas,bazaars,cake and plant     
 sales and bring and buy sales.
