		<title>01Church Hill &amp; Castle Dillon</title>
		<content> This is an area many small hills which
 have been divided into fields.        
 Hedgerows are still fairly dense with 
 many large trees.   There are some    
 patches of woodland in the area of    
 Castle Dillon - deciduous and stands  
 of pine.   In the hollows there is    
 some fen type marshland.   This area  
 is mostly maintained farmland-used for
 livestock/dairying.   There is only a 
 little cultivation.   Quarrying is    
 another important activity in this    
 block for a lime and roadstone.       
 Therre is a small hamlet around       
 Salters Grange and to the east of the 
 block some larger estates.   Most     
 people work in Armagh and the         
 surrounding larger towns.   Many      
 single houses are non-farms.
