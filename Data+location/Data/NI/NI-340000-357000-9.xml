		<title>09SAINTFIELD INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</title>
		<content> The first part of this building was   
 erected in 1963,and extended to over 5
 acres in 1965.It was formerly a       
 factory that produced knitting and    
 carpet yarn,but when so many similar  
 factories closed,the building was     
 divided into 20 small businesses      
 employing over 100 people.            
{CASEMENT WINDOWS:}Here they make UPVC 
 windows.The machines required come    
 from Germany.                         
{SAMSON YARNS:}This firm produces      
 synthetic fibre from plastic pellets  
 which are supplied by oil refineries. 
 There are 22 tonnes of polypropylene  
 pellets imported from Belgium monthly.
 The molten plastic is extruded through
 small holes forming thin strands,then 
 stretched on hot rollers for strength.
 The fibres are used to make horse     
 harness straps,elastic and mattress   
 cloth,some is exported to England.    </content>
