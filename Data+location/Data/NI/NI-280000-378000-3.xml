		<title>03EDUCATION - PRIMARY SCHOOLS</title>
		<content>  The present Primary School opened in 
 September 1967, when two older schols 
 in the town, Derryloran and Burn Road 
 were amalgamated. It opened with 613  
 pupils and increased to 836 in 1979   
 necessitating the acqisition of       
 several temporary classrooms. Numbers 
 have now gone down to 659 involving   
 some teacher redundency.              
   The children came in at the age of  
 4.5 to 5 years and move on to         
 secondary school at the age of 11+.The
 primary subjects taught are           
 Mathematics and English, with a little
 Geography, History, Nature Study and  
 Computer work. The classes commence at
 9 am and finish at 3.15 pm with 15    
 minutes for break and 50 minutes for  
 lunch.  The school has its own kitchen
 for meals and the assembly_hall serves
 as the dining room.
