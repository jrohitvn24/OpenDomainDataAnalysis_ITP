		<content> " The Tannery."  The Atlantic Tanning}
 Company, known locally as "the        
 Tannery," is very important to        
 Killyleagh.  Its work force is mainly 
 from the Killyleagh area.  At least   
 120 workers are local of whom 26% are 
 women.  They work a shift system from 
 08.00 hours to 17.00 hours and 14.00  
 hours to 24.00 hours.                 
 The Tannery exports goods world wide, 
 but most are bought by the home market
 in the United Kingdom.  They usually  
 transport their goods by lorry and    
 sea, but occasionally by air.         
 The Tannery only produces the basic   
 leather with the colour added, it is  
 the purchaser who then turns it into  
 the required article such as shoes and
 coats.  Every week the Tannery        
 produces between 15000 and 18000      
 square feet of leather.
