{The post office}takes up a corner of a
 small supermarket.It consists  of a   
 single table sized counter with a     
 number of shelves.On these are kept   
 the files, ledgers,stamps etc.It has  
 been there for at least 30 years.The  
 opening hours are from nine o'clock   
 until five weekdays and from nine to  
 twelve on Saturdays.The post          
 office/shop are a family concern.The  
 people who come into the post office  
 are usually from the local area.The   
 post office does not however handle   
 any mail or parcels.A post man        
 delivers the mail straight from       
 Lisburn.The nearest post office would 
 be in Lisburn.                        
 The nearest bank or building society  
 would be situated in Lisburn.
