		<title>03DAIRY FARMING, DERVOCK.</title>
		<content> There are{five dairy}farms in our     
 block. In{Winter}the cows mainly feed 
 on silage, hay and bought-in meal.    
 Two of the dairy farmers have herds   
 less than twenty. In{Spring}cows      
 are put in the field between milkings.
 They are fed on grass and some farmers
 feed meal in the parlour during       
 milkings. The{average acreage}of dairy
 farms is about{85.}Meal is bought in  
 although one farmer mixes his own     
 using barley produced on the farm.    
 Farmers also use crushed barley to    
 feed calves. There are{3 parlours}and{
{2 byres}being used to milk cows. The  
 byres are used by the smaller dairy   
 herds. In the Winter time the cows can
 stay in the byre all day and be       
 milked there too. In bigger herds the 
 cows stay in cubicle houses and are   
 brought to the milking parlour for    
 milking.                              </content>
