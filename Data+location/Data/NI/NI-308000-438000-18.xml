		<title>18BATTLE OF GLENTAISIE I</title>
		<content> This battle took place on the second  
 of May, 1565 at the foot of           
 Knocklayde. The battle was fought     
 between the army of Shane O'Neill and 
 the Scots army of James and Sorley Boy
 MacDonnell.                           
 The battle took place here because    
 O'Neill forced the Scots to retreat   
 north.James MacDonnell had arrived    
 from Scotland at Cushendun when he    
 heard that O'Neill had attacked.      
 After meeting up with Sorley Boy they 
 retreated to Ballycastle. They hoped  
 that Alexander Og MacDonnell would    
 come with reinforcements but this did 
 not happen.                           
 They chose their position for battle  
 in Glentaisie at the foot of          
 Knocklayde. In the morning of May 2nd 
 before five o'clock O'Neill moved in.
