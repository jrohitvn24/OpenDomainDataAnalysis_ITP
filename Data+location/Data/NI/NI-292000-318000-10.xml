		<content> On Christmas Eve,people put a lighted 
 candle in the window to welcome       
 strangers.At Halloween,31st October,  
 the young people usually play tricks  
 on their neighbours by changing       
 gates,letting down tyres on           
 vehicles,knocking on doors etc.Games  
 are also played with apples,_ putting 
 an apple in a basin of water and      
 trying to take a bite out of it       
 without using the hands;tying an apple
 to a string and trying to bite it.    
 Apple tarts are baked with rings      
 inside and whoever gets the piece with
 the ring is believed to be the person 
 who will be married first.A huge      
 bonfire is the highlight of the       
 occasion and young people prepare     
 several days beforehand by collecting 
 material for the fire.On May morning, 
 May flowers are left on the door step 
 to bring luck and prosperity to all.  </content>
