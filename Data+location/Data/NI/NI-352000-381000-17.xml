{ Rain "Cricis" for Potato Farmers}    
 Due to this year's wet summer,local   
 farmers have experienced a number of  
 costly problems,with some crops       
 suffering badly -namely potatoes,soft 
 fruit and hay.                        
     The low prices for potatoes are   
 blamed on a number of factors.This    
 year Cyprus potatoes arrived late and 
 clashed badly in the shops with early 
 local potatoes.This fall in price was 
 further encouraged by the wet weather 
 which produced larger yields than     
 normal.Some farmers have already      
 decided to cut their losses and just  
 ploughed their potatoes back into the 
 fields                                
     Hay has also been badly affected  
 and a lot has been destroyed by the   
 weather which discouraged harvesting. </content>
