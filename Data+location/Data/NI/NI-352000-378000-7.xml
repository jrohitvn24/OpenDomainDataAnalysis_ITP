		<content> My favourite recreation is Trials.In  
 trials there are sections you have to 
 do and the idea is to do them without 
 putting your foot down or stopping in 
 the section.There is an observer at   
 the end of the section that punches   
 your card for whatever points you got.
 My bike is a Yamaha TY 175 and it is  
 white. I get to the trials by car and 
 trailer. The youngest you can start   
 entering the trials is six years      
 old.                                  
 They ride 80cc bikes. The three grades
 are cadets,school boys and seniors. I 
 cannot ride the bike to the trial     
 because it is against the law and the 
 is not made for the road. I go to the 
 the trial on Saturdays at different   
 places like the leadmines in          
 Netownards and other places further   
 away. It is good fun but some times   
 you come off and hurt your self.      </content>
