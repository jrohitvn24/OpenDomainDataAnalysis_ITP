		<title>06A DUNGANNON BOY'S SATURDAY</title>
		<content>                                       
 While descusing the topic of Life     
 Styles in preparation for the project,
 there was unanimous agreement amoung  
 all taking part that the best day of  
 the week for everyone was Saturday. In
 order to analyse why this was so, it  
 was decided to make a survey over a   
 period of weeks. Each boy, who was    
 actually involved in the project,     
 recorded how he spent his time each   
 Saturday. From these records we were  
 able to form a reasonably clear       
 picture of how the average eleven year
 old school boy enjoys his Saturday.   
 To help illustrate our findings we    
 have invented a character called{Joe  
{Average}and he will tell you how he   
 spends a typical Saturday in his life.
