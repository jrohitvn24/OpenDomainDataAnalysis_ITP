		<title>12Tyrone Crystal</title>
		<content> Towards the end of the 1960's a       
 group                                 
 of people concerned at the very high  
 level of unemployment in the Dungannon
 area,formed themselves into the{Tyrone
{Development Association.}Led by       
 Fr.Austin Eustace the Association     
 discovered their brief was simple:to  
 find and industry which was labor     
 intensive and whose end product was   
 acceptable in the market places of the
 world.After intensive investigations  
 and many feasability studies it was   
 decided to manufacture full lead      
 crystal.                              
   The name{TYRONE CRYSTAL}was first   
 heard in 1969 when it was registered  
 as a Limited Company.Few of the share 
 holders really believed the project   
 could sucseed.Still the founders      
 plodded on with their plans and began 
 to train young men as glass cutters.  </content>
