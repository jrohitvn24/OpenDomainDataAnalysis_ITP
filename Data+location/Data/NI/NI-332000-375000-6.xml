		<title>06TIGER'S BAY</title>
		<content> Tiger's Bay was a village really- five
 narrow streets fitting neatly into the
 jigsaw of N.Belfast.  We had our      
 school and post office.  There was a  
 Tiger's Bay handy woman who attended  
 at childbirths and in the house       
 opposite ours there was a very old    
 woman who laid out and washed the     
 dead.  A man in our street did        
 carpentry work for the village, and   
 also an old Jewish refugee from Russia
 replaced our broken windows.  The     
 ministers of the church were very     
 important people in our lives.  The   
 whole family knelt on the stone floor 
 and joined in prayer to mark the end  
 of a minister's visit to the house.
