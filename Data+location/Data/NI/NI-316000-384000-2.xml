		<content> Because of the high density housing in
 the West of the area a number of      
 schools were built l7 years ago.      
 Before this two small schools existed,
 they were the Lawther Primary School  
 and Muckamore Primary School.  The    
 former still exists serving the rural 
 eastern region of the block.          
 The latter was replaced by Ballycraigy
 Primary School reaching a peak of 550 
 pupils but has declined to 320 at     
 present.                              
 Other schools in the area are         
 Greystone Primary School drawing      
 children from Protestant families, St.
 Joseph's Primary School caters for the
 Roman Catholic families in the area.  
 Greenmount Agricultural College has an
 experimental farm on our block and in 
 the Muckamore Abbey Hospital complex  
 there is a school for Handicapped     
 children.                             </content>
