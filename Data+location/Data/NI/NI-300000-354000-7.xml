 farm.The farmer makes his living with 
 his apple orchards,dairy cows and beef
 cattle.He picks the apples and packs  
 them in boxes to be taken to the shops
 to be sold.Damaged apples are taken to
 the Green Gate factories where they   
 are made into {apple juice.           
    {Beef}comes from beef cattle.The   
 cattle eat the grass until they are   
 fat enough to go to the slaughter     
 house.                                
    The farmer makes silage in the     
 month of of June or July so that when 
 winter comes they don't have to go out
 in the fields.                        
    At the farm the cows are milked    
 twice a day.Once in the morning and   
 once in the                           
 evening.Butter,cheese,cream and yogurt
 can all be made from milk.
