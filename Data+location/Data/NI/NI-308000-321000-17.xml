		<title>17A TYPICAL DAY'S DIET</title>
		<content> A day's diet for working residents in 
 this area starts with breakfast.  It  
 consists usually of cereal, a boiled  
 egg, soda or wheaten bread and tea.   
 At mid_morning a break of tea and     
 biscuits is taken.  Lunch is then     
 prepared and consists in the winter   
 months of soup and bread, and in the  
 summer time of salad, sandwiches,     
 yoghurt and fruit.  The most          
 substantial meal of the day is evening
 dinner.  The family chooses from a    
 variety of red meats, poultry or fish 
 with vegetables such as: cabbage,     
 cauliflower, peas or carrots.         
 Occasionally there is a dessert of    
 apple or rhubarb tart with custard or 
 fresh cream, ice_cream and jelly, or  
 fruit salad, followed by tea or       
 coffee.  Supper for the children is   
 cornflakes and milk, whilst older     
 family members choose tea and cake.   </content>
