		<content> As an industry,this is the highest    
 employer in the block.The Forest of   
 Drumkeeragh covers one hundred and    
 eighty hectares and has approximately 
 half a million trees.It was first     
 planted on an area of semi-bogland in 
 1937by the Department of Forestry and 
 was not thinned out.                  
  It is at present being harvested as a
 forest crop.The harvesting is being   
 done in sections,and is immediately   
 being replanted at the rate of 2,5000 
 to the hectare.It is hoped to have the
 operation completed in 1986.          
  The types of trees grown are Sitka   
 and Norway spruce,European and        
 Japanese larch,Scots and Pole pine,and
 Douglas fir.It will be about fifty    
 years before the forest is harvested  
 again.
