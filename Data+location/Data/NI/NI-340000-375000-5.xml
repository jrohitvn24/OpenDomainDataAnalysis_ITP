 The large hospital at Dundonald was   
 opened in 1962.The foundation stone   
 was laid by HRH the Duchess of        
 Gloucester.The hospital occupies 57   
 acres and is usually refered to as The
 Ulster Hospital.                      
 One of the main functions is to       
 provide specialist treatment for the  
 childrens surgical problems.In 1972   
 there were 538 beds for children,     
 maternity patients and premature      
 babies.                               
 Accomodation for nurses is close      
 by. There is a school for nursing at  
 Dundonald and in 1973 there were 183  
 nurses being trained there.           
 A distinctive architectural feature of
 the hospital is the tall water tank at
 the rear. It is shaped like a tulip   
 and it is a difficult job to carry out
 maintenance work on it.               </content>
