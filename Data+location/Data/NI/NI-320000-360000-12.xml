		<title>12CHURCHES IN THE MAZE AREA</title>
		<content>{ St.Matthew's  Church of Ireland      
 was constructed about 150 years ago.It
 is situated on a small hill with a    
 small graveyard to the front.The main 
 body of the church is small and       
 rectangular.This is fronted by a      
 lovely square clock tower.The grounds 
 are surrounded by large trees which   
 shade the church giving it a peaceful 
 appearence.The minister lives in the  
 rectory which is about 100 yards from 
 the church.His congregation would     
 roughly number about 240.Most of these
 people live in the surrounding area   
 and some come from Lisburn.There are 2
 services on Sunday and on Saints days.
{ Broomhedge Methodist Church}is a     
 slightly smaller church.It doesn't    
 appear to be open at all.There are    
 quite a number of Masonic,Orange and  
 church halls in the area.
