		<content> The main changes in Holywood over the 
 last ten years are newly built        
 buildings and modern houses and flats.
                                       
 Changes needed in Holywood include a  
 new leisure-centre with a             
 swimming-pool. Fourteen people worked 
 in Holywood, six worked elsewhere and 
 four people had retired.  Most of the 
 people who work in Holywood are       
 housewives and the other types of work
 their families do are hairdressing,   
 waitressing and fitting.              
                                       
 The number of people working in       
 Holywood was nine but the highest     
 number of people working elsewhere was
 fifteen and they worked in Belfast.
