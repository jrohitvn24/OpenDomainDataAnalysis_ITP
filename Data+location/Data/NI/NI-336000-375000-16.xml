		<title>16A FARM</title>
		<content> MOST OF THIS FARM IS SITUATED IN      
 BALLYMACHAN,WHICH IS ONE OF THE       
 SMALLEST TOWNLANDS IN THE LOCALITY.MY 
 FATHER AND UNCLE ARE JOINT OWNERS OF  
 THIS LAND.THEY OWN 15O ACRES AND RENT 
 34 ACRES.THE LAND USED TO BE IN TWO   
 SEPARATE FARMS_GLENMACHAN AND         
 KNOCKNAGONEY_BUT NOW THE FARMHOUSES   
 ARE OCCUPIED BY THE GLENMACHAN HOTEL  
 AND THE R.U.C.                        
   THE MAIN CROPS ARE WINTER AND SPRING
 BARLEY.WINTER BARLEY IS SOWN IN       
 SEPTEMBER AND HARVESTED IN LATE JULY. 
 SPRING BARLEY IS SOWN IN APRIL AND    
 HARVESTED AT THE END OF AUGUST.OTHER  
 CROPS ARE PASTURE,SILAGE AND WHEAT.   
   THE CATTLE ON THIS FARM ARE HEIFERS 
 AND YOUNG STOCK.IT IS VERY DIFFICULT  
 TO FARM SO NEAR A BUILT-UP AREA       
 BECAUSE OF VANDALS AND STRAY DOGS     
 WHICH FREQUENTLY CHASE THE CATTLE.THE 
 FARM BUILDINGS ARE BUILT OF RED BRICK.</content>
