		<content>  The summer of 1985 has, according to 
 Met Office figures, been one of the   
 wettest in local living memory. For   
 the agricultural community of Mourne  
 this has spelt disaster. For Mr.      
 William Campbell of Aughnaloopy it has
 meant the devastation of much of his  
 crop of potatoes. "Water is lying in  
 almost every field and underground the
 potatoes are rotting. Those which     
 survive will be difficult to lift     
 because of the state of the soil."    
  The government has done little to    
 alleviate the plight of men like Mr.  
 Campbell. The small herd of cattle Mr.
 Campbell keeps have been kept indoors 
 to stop them poaching the sodden      
 ground. This has been done at great   
 cost to him.                          
  Winter prospects look equally bleak.
