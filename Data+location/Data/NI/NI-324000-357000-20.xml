		<content>{The Parish Church was opened in       
{1773 after thirteen years work.       
     In 1662 Arthur Hill constructed "a
 spacious church on rising ground in   
 the form of a cross, dedicated to{St. 
{Malachias."}The remnants of this early
 church are clearly to be found in     
 today's structure, which was the work 
 of the greatest Hill of all, Wills.   
     It stands virtually unchanged     
 today flanked by the graveyard and    
 Fort, looking down three hundred      
 metres of tree-lined lawn to the      
 centre of the village.                
     In the{Tower}there is a peal of   
 eight bells installed in 1772, with an
 electric carillon to ring a hymn tune 
 every day at every fourth hour.       
   { The Hill family vault}lies under  
 the north transept.{The high box pews 
 are made of local oak.
