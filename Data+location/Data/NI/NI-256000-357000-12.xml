		<content> There are no schools in this region so
 children travel to school by school   
 bus.For Catholic children there are   
 two primary schools one just off the  
 north _ west corner at Garvaghey and  
 the other just outside the eastern    
 boundary at Glencull. Protestant      
 children go to primary school in      
 Ballygawley County while those in the 
 south-west attend Augher Central.     
   St. Ciaran's High School in         
 Ballygawley caters for most post      
 primary Catholic children while       
 Protestants go to Aughacloy Secondary.
 A few children from both denominations
 attend their respective Grammar       
 Schools in Omagh.
