		<title>06A GREENISLAND GIRL'S DAY(2)</title>
		<content> I love music so part of most days is  
 taken up by practising on my violin.  
   Recently I've been singing and      
 playing the recorder too as I've been 
 preparing for the Carrick Festival.All
 the extra work has been worth it      
 because I won a cup and a medal.      
   The day I enjoy most is Thursday _  
 that's swimming day at school and in  
 the evenings I meet my friends at Girl
 Guides.                               
   All too soon it is the time I hate _
 9 o'clock _ time for bed.Isn't it     
 funny that the bed you don't want to  
 get out of in the morning is the same 
 one you don't want to get into at     
 night?                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
