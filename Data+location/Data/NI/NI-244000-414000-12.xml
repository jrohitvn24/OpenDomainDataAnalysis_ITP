		<title>12STREET GAMES</title>
		<content> In{GOBNASCALE}we have a variety of    
 games. Young boys play{soldiers,      
{football, BMX racing }and {pitching.} 
 In this boys pitch coins against a    
 wall and whoever gets the nearest to  
 the wall wins all the money.          
 Young girls play{houses,schools,      
{rollerskating,swings,ala_bala,bicky or
{frenchy,rounders and racing.}When boys
 and girls play together they play {   
{hide and seek,tinny tin tin}and the   
 most common game is {Knick_knock,}    
 which is knocking on doors ,running   
 away and hiding.{Pads or kerby }is    
 another favourite.The players stand on
 each side of the street.The player    
 throws a ball and,if it hits the kerb,
 a point is scored.More skilful throws 
 earn more points.                     
 Our parents played most of these games
 when they were children.
