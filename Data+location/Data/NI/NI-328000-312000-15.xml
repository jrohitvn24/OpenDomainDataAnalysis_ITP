		<content> WITH A STEADILY GROWING POPULATION    
 THERE IS AN INCREASING DEMAND IN      
 KILKEEL FOR THE PROVISION OF CLUBS AND
 ORGANISATIONS FOR THE YOUTH.  MOST OF 
 THESE YOUTH CLUBS ARE CONNECTED TO THE
 6 LOCAL CHURCHES COMPRISING MOURNE    
 PRESBYTERIAN, KILKEEL PRESBYTERIAN,   
 CHURCH OF IRELAND, BAPTIST, MOURNE    
 FREE PRESBYTERIAN AND ST. COLMAN'S    
 ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. THE FACILITIES 
 PROVIDED BY THESE CHURCHES ARE IN     
 CONSTANT USE, ESPECIALLY DURING THE   
 WINTER MONTHS.  DURING THE SUMMER THE 
 EXCELLENT OUTDOOR FACILITIES ARE MADE 
 USE OF.                               
 MOURNE PRESBYTERIAN, WITH OVER 600    
 FAMILIES, IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST       
 PROVINCIAL CHURCHES IN NORTHERN       
 IRELAND.  IN 1984 A YOUTH CENTRE WAS  
 COMPLETED WITHIN THE CHURCH GROUNDS,  
 AND IT IS IN USE EVERY NIGHT OF THE   
 WEEK.                                 </content>
