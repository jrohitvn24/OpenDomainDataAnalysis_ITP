		<title>13Cullyhanna Superstitions (1)</title>
		<content> There are many superstitions in our   
 area and some people still believe in 
 them today. For instance,one should   
 not walk under a ladder as it is      
 considered unlucky and one should say 
 "God Bless You"to anyone who sneezes. 
 Do not look through the window at a   
 new moon and never put up an umbrella 
 in the house as it brings bad luck.If 
 you kill a spider,it will rain and if 
 a spider runs up your arm you will    
 become rich.One magpie brings bad luck
 - two are said to be lucky.If the oak 
 is in leaf before the ash,it will only
 rain a little during the summer,but if
 the ash is before the oak,then we are 
 to get a soak!Two spoons in a cup is  
 the sign of a wedding in the family   
 and two members of the family should  
 not get wed in the one year.It is     
 generally believed,"Happy is the bride
 that the sun shines on."              </content>
