		<content> Farming, fishing and labouring make up
 the largest number of jobs in the     
 area. There are quite a number of     
 skilled jobs including plumbing       
 welding, electronics etc but few      
 professional workers such as trades   
 and accounts. Approximately 45% of the
 population are unemployed and in most 
 homes ,50%, the mother works either in
 the home for someone else or goes out 
 to work.                              
      The recurrence of the family     
 names of O'Neill (they make up 1/6 of 
 the children attending the local      
 primary school), Quinn , Devlin and   
 Mc Grath, to name only a few , has led
 to the widespread use of nicknames to 
 differenciate between the various     
 families many of whom tend to live in 
 the same town land.Some of the Oneill 
 nicknames include Swemer, Hardwall,   
 Rebel, Tressa's and Yankees.          </content>
