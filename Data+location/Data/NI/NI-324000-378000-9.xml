		<title>09LOCAL HISTORY - SETTLEMENTS</title>
		<content> The townland of Ballyutoag has been   
 occupied for a very long time. It     
 contains a number of historic sites.  
 One of these is situated at           
 Aughnabrack. It was excavated by      
 archaeologists in 1981 and 1982. In   
 two small oval enclosures they        
 discovered the remains of 23 houses   
 which have been dated somewhere       
 between 500 and 1000 AD. This would   
 indicate a village of at least 100    
 people. This settlement, being 900    
 feet above sea level, was probably not
 permanent but may have been a         
 transhumance village. This means the  
 people brought their animals to these 
 upland pastures during the summer     
 months.
