		<title>01GEOGRAPHY OF CULMORE AREA</title>
		<content>    The land in the area is undulating 
 although no great height is attained. 
 Towards the city side the land slopes 
 from 10 ms to maximum heights of 80 ms
 at Ballynashallog and 70 ms at        
 Ballyarnet.Between these two areas    
 there is a valley where Ballyarnet    
 Lake is found.The rocks are           
 metamorphic and are known as Dalradian
 schist.                               
    The Waterside area slopes gently   
 but only reaches a maximum height of  
 40 ms at Lissahawley.The rocks here   
 are carboniferous.The river ranges    
 from a minimum width of a half km at  
 Culmore Point to a maximum width of   
 one and a half kms at the Culmore     
 reservoir.The river valley,which was  
 once glaciated,has signs of deposition
 along its banks.This area presents a  
 picture of a gently sloping land on   
 the banks of the River Foyle.         </content>
