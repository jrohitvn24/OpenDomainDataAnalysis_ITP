		<title>14RECREATION IN GALGORM</title>
		<content>  The only recreation facilities in    
 Galgorm are the Community Centre where
 clubs, keep fit classes, Womens       
 Institute, Senior Citizens and        
 playgroups are held, and the two      
 public football pitches. People who   
 are unemployed have to try to occupy  
 their time. Some of them go fishing or
 shooting. Farmers let out some of     
 their land for shooting game.         
  Many teenagers joined a band which is
 now called 'Pride of Maine' and it    
 leads Galgorm Orangemen at the 12th of
 July band parade.                     
  If the residents of Galgorm wish to  
 do more active sports such as         
 badminton, tennis, squash or swimming 
 they have to go to Ballymena to       
 perhaps the Seven Towers Leisure      
 Centre, People's Park, Ballymena Golf 
 Club and Rugby Football Club.
