		<title>01Hills North of Newtownbutler</title>
		<content> This area is one of low rolling hills 
 or drumlins 250-350ft above sea level 
 diminishing in height as we go from   
 North East to South West towards the  
 shores of Lough Erne. The ground is   
 wet and is very soft in the low ground
 between the hills. Streams meander    
 between the hills via bogs and lakes  
 towards Lough Erne.                   
 The soil is heavy and impervious.     
 Grass is the only crop in the form of 
 meadow and grazing. The hedges are    
 thick and mainly whitethorn and       
 blackthorn.                           
 Cattle rearing for milk and beef is   
 the main occupation of the local      
 people on  their small family farms.  
 The lush damp pastures of the hills   
 and foothills are vivid dark green    
 which in winter contrasts richly with 
 the various shades of brown in the    
 hedges and bogs.                      </content>
