		<content>       Yesterday we visited a factory  
 called{S.T.C.}(Standard Telephones and
 Cables). When we arrived we had to    
 wear I.D. cards and a man showed us   
 round the part where they make the    
 push button telephones. It was great. 
 We saw all the machines putting in    
 microchips and things and people      
 checking that the phones worked okay. 
       When we got back to school we   
 had to find out more about S.T.C. We  
 discovered that the factory was opened
 in 1962 and was the second biggest of 
 14 such factories in the U.K. The site
 covers 42 acres now.                  
       We found it also made telephone 
 exchanges and used to employ 2,000    
 people though the man told us that    
 many people have lost their jobs      
 recently and some more might be made  
 redundant soon.                       
                                       </content>
