		<title>19Fears For The Future</title>
		<content> Our class of 30 pupils conducted a    
 survey of parents into what their     
 fears were for the the future and this
 is what they said.Some feared that    
 alens would take over the world,      
 Nuclear weapons would destroy the     
 world and the standard of living would
 get worse.Unemployment would get worse
 because of advanced machinery .They   
 also feared that there would be no    
 solution to the Ulster problem.That   
 our natural resorses would become     
 exhausted and that the environment    
 would be destroyed through manufacture
 of Nuclear reactions, over population 
 might lead  to starvation and that    
 there might be more young people      
 taking drugs.                         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
