		<title>11FROM CAMP TO CRUMLIN PRIMARY</title>
		<content>    Our school is not a very big school
 but it is bigger than the average     
 school in a village of Crumlin's      
 size.It is bigger because a lot of    
 R.A.F and Queens Own Hilander's kids  
 come here.We should have about 250    
 pupils but we have over 350.          
    We do not have to pay for the      
 season bus passes when we go to school
 in the morning and return in the      
 afternoon because the journey is over 
 4 miles.Although Aldergrove R.A.F base
 is less than 1 mile from Crumlin we   
 have to detour over 4 miles to go     
 through the V.C.P(Vehicle Check Point)
 In the mornings all the forces        
 children travel to school by bus and  
 we have a great time singing or       
 shouting before we reach school.      
    We have a bus escourt called Mrs   
 Crump but she is not as strick as     
 teachers would be.                    </content>
