		<title>02LOCATION OF HOLYWOOD/1</title>
		<content> Holywood is a small township located  
 on the Southern or County Down shore  
 of Belfast Lough.  It is about five   
 miles from the centre of Belfast and  
 is practically a suburb of that city. 
 It is separated from Belfast, the     
 capital city, by open fields at       
 Knocknagoney and bounded by Belfast   
 Lough and the Holywood Hills.         
                                       
 Holywood is in the Barony of          
 Castlereagh.  In the early 13th       
 Century the place was known as SANCTUS
 BOSCUS meaning "Holy wood".  It is a  
 tradition among the old inhabitants,  
 that the name was given on account of 
 the strictness of the order of monks  
 who inhabited the priory and also     
 there was a very extensive wood       
 adjacent to the church and village.
