		<title>13 Health Clinic Continued.</title>
		<content>country places within 4 km of the      
clinic.                                
                                       
 The clinic started up between 15 and  
20 years ago.  Improvements could be   
made to the 200 year old building.  It 
is very cold inside and occasionally   
the electricity goes off.              
                                       
 There used to be a Housing Executive  
office in the clinic but it had to     
close down because not enough people   
attended it.  A dentist used to be at  
the clinic but he is no longer there.  
An eye clinic is going to start up very
soon and it is going to be held once a 
month or every three months.  Everybody
seems to be very happy about the       
clinic.
