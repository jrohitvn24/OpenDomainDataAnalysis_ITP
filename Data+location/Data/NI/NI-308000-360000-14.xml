		<title>14Decca Navigation Station</title>
		<content> The Decca Navigation Station was built
 about 34 years ago in 1951.There are  
 four stations like it in Ireland and  
 sixteen in Britain. Locally it is     
 called the rader station but it is not
 rader.It transmits a radio signal of  
 very long waves. Ships collect the    
 signal,they also collect signals from 
 two other stations like it. It needs  
 all of these signals to point out its 
 precise position. Aeroplanes can not  
 use the system because they fly too   
 fast. The transmitter gets its power  
 from electricty. If this fails Two    
 diesel generators take over. The three
 aerials each 51\ m (168 ft) are that  
 tall so that the signal can get far   
 out to the sea.
