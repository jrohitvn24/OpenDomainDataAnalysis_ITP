		<content> HOUSING:Our house is very old.It was  
 built in 1904 and was 81 years in May 
 1985.It has had a lot of previous     
 owners.The house which has three      
 floors has recently recieced a change.
 The house is built of red brick like  
 most of the houses in the street.The  
 house used to be a guest house we know
 because two of the rooms have         
 bells.Our kitchen had a lot of modren 
 equipment installed and we got a new  
 boiler.Now every room has at least two
 plug sockets.We now can use the full  
 15 rooms without getting cold.Our     
 house like most of the houses in      
 the street is semi_detached,on the    
 Lansdowne RD there is two houses      
 joined to each other.We have also got 
 a video recorder and a BBC            
 computer.I live at Bristol AVE.
