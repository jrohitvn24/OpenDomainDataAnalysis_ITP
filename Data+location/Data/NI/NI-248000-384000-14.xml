		<title>14        GOLD PROSPECTING</title>
		<content> Gold prospecting has recently begun   
 in this area and the results look     
 promising.                            
      Eight men are based Gortin.They  
 go out on the mountain  and take soil 
 samples.Then they take cobria         
 samples.They also pan for gold in     
 rivers and streams.If they find gold  
 in the rocks or in the water they     
 bring out a dimond drill and drill a  
 deep test hole in the rock.They bring 
 the rock down to Gortin.The rock is   
 crushed up in a crusher.Then it is    
 sampled.Anything intresting is sent to
 Limerick to see how much gold is in   
 it.                                   
  They have two "moon buggies".They    
 take them out to get up the hills.The 
 first person to find out about the    
 gold was a man called Garthe.He found 
 out about it when he was taking       
 samples.                              </content>
