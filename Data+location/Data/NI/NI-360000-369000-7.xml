		<title>07 Tourism in Ballywalter</title>
		<content>    Ballywalter is a little seaside    
 village about 30 km from Belfast.     
 Before the car and package holidays   
 abroad there were six or maybe more   
 hotels in Ballywalter. People felt    
 that 30 km was far enough to travel so
 they often rented a house for a month 
 in this village.                      
    Villagers made a little money by   
 doing bed and breakfast which either  
 poor people went to or rich people who
 couldn't get a room in any of the     
 hotels. Now there are no hotels at    
 all. If people come to Ballywlater now
 they just come on day trips.          
    Half of the eastern coast of our   
 block is caravan sites. Farmers who   
 live along the coast own and look     
 after these sites.                    
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
