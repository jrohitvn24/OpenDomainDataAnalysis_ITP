		<title>15ST.PATRICK'S PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> St.Patrick's Primary School was       
 erected in 1938 by Pierce of          
 Enniskillen, being financed chiefly by
 the Department of Education.Two       
 extensions have been added since then,
 one in 1970 and one in 1973.The school
 has five classrooms, one mobile       
 classroom and a small remedial room.We
 also have a reasonably large dining   
 hall, a staffroom and a small office. 
       It is a seven_teacher school,   
 administered by the Principal, Mr.    
 Michael Farrell.Presently there are   
 180 pupils on roll.There is also a    
 part-time secretary.                  
                     The school has a  
 large play area both to the front and 
 back, covered mainly by grass.The     
 entire school grounds cover an area of
 approximately 10,369 sq. metres.
