		<title>03ON THE FARM</title>
		<content> This farm is owned by Mr.Mc Nabb and  
 is situated about three miles due     
 south of Downpatrick,county town of   
 Down.Mr.Mc Nabb's farm is about 250   
 acres in size and is known as a mixed 
 farm i.e. he raises cattle,grows crops
 and keeps poultry.Life is not easy    
 with the whole day taken up in        
 constant care and attention of the    
 animals, crops,land and               
 buildings.Mr.Mc Nabb has two sons who 
 help him run his farm.In the summer   
 time they are very busy firstly       
 cutting silage and storing it in large
 silos for the winter.The Mc Nabb's    
 also like to keep a few acres for hay 
 and as soon as the first cut of silage
 is finished the hay is                
 harvested.Modern machinery helps      
 greatly to speed up these             
 processes.
