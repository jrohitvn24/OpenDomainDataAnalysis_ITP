		<title>11MY TYPICAL DAY IN DERVOCK.</title>
		<content> My name is David McLernon, I am 11. On
 school days I get up at {7.30,}have   
 breakfast of porridge and toast with  
 butter and jam and tea. I wash, brush 
 my teeth and dress. Usually I bring   
 crisps for morning break and walk to  
 school with my younger brother Frank, 
 which takes about{5 minutes.}School   
 starts at{9am}and finihes at{3pm.}At  
 break and lunchtime I enjoy playing   
 football with my friends.             
 After school I do my homework first,  
 which usually takes about half an     
 hour, then I might go to the shop in  
 the village for mother. I like to play
 in the hut I made with my friends, or 
 have a game of rounders, hide-and-seek
 or football, and usually watch some   
 programmes on children's television. I
 am a member of the{Junior Orange Lodge
 which meets once a month. If I can't  
 play outside, I stay inside and draw. </content>
