		<content>  Half the people in our area are      
 employed in farming because of the    
 large percentage of farmland.There are
 no industrial estates mainly because  
 of the dispersed nature of the        
 population,and the lack of mineral    
 wealth in the area.                   
  Milford Mill is in our area.The mill 
 is not working now but years ago it   
 used to weave and dye linen.The mill  
 had 200 employees working the machines
 inside it and 13 employees who worked 
 on the farm. In some of the larger    
 farms,the farmers would employ        
 boys(who could be looking for a summer
 job)to help them. As Milford is just  
 outside Armagh a lot of people who    
 live there work in Armagh.The Milford 
 folk that work in Armagh would work in
 different types of places such as     
 hospitals,library and shops.
