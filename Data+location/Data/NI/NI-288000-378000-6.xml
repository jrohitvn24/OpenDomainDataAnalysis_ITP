		<content> In connection with{Ulster Tree Week}  
 the pupils planted trees, provided by 
 the Area Board, in the school grounds 
 and afterwards an officer from the    
 Board Grounds Maintenance Staff gave a
 talk on tree conservation.            
   This year the{school trip}was to the
 Safari Lion Park Co.Antrim. Mrs. Booth
 and Mrs. Mc Vitty are coaching pupils 
 for the{Cycling Proficiency Test.     
   The School Management Committee, at 
 a recent meeting, requested that the  
{School Warning Signs}be displayed more
 prominently, in view of the increased 
 volume of traffic. The Board's Senior 
 Road Safety Officer is dealing with   
 the matter.                           
  {Jimmy Kennedy,}a famous former pupil
 of the school wrote many popular songs
 including 'Red Sails In The Sunset',  
 and 'South Of The Border'.He lived in 
 the village in Tamlaght Rectory.      </content>
