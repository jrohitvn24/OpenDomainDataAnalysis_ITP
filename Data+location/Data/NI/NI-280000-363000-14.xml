		<title>14Tyrone Crystal</title>
		<content> With the factory now complete{Tyrone  
{Crystal}wanted to manufacture full    
 lead crystal,not merely to cut        
 imported blank glass.So a glass       
 Blowing Department had to be          
 initiated.                            
   Furnaces were installed and an      
 Austrian master blower,who learnt his 
 craft in Germany and Sweden,was       
 recruited.He set up the Blowing Shop  
 and trained all the personnel.Now     
{Tyrone Crystal}was in a position to   
 carry out the whole operation from    
 mixing the raw materials to applying  
 acid polish which brings out the      
 lustre of full lead crystal.          
 The first years were spent in training
 a young workforce.The basic training  
 period in the lead crystal industry in
 4 yrs-and even then there is much to  
 be learned for there are skills that  
 only experience can teach.            </content>
