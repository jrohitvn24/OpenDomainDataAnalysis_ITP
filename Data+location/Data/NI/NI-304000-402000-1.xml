		<title>01THE AREA SURVEYED</title>
		<content> The area covered by our survey        
 includes the town lands of Cardonaghy,
 Moyasset, Moneydollog, Corbally,      
 Fenaghy, Galgorm, Killane and         
 Lisnifillon.                          
  This is a rural area in the valley of
 the River Main. The land is low lying 
 mostly less than 120 metres high  with
 farming as the main activity.         
  Some of the houses in the area, for  
 example, Fenaghy House and Corbally   
 House are of historical and           
 architectural interest. There is a    
 riding school for the disabled.       
  Less than 10% of our area is taken up
 by the Village of Galgorm and its     
 Industrial Estate.                    
  The area is crossed by mainly B class
 and minor roads and the Ballymena to  
 Cullybacky section of the Belfast to  
 Londonderry railway line cuts across  
 the North-East corner of the area.    </content>
