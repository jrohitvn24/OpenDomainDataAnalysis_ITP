		<title>01Landscape,       Randalstown</title>
		<content> Situated approx. 5kms north west of   
 Randalstown and 10 kms south west of  
 Ballymena we find the highest point of
 our block,(131m),on the Portglenone   
 Road ,close to the Kilnock crossroads.
 There are several other small rounded 
 hills in the area,but generally the   
 land slopes away from west to east    
 towards the Maine river valley. It is 
 obvious from this high point that     
 farming dominates the region. On all  
 sides green fields,farmhouses,and     
 grazing animals come into view.       
   Most of the land is rough pasture,  
 the major land cover being grass for  
 grazing. There are around 50 small    
 farms in the area,with{95%}of the     
 land being divided by hedges and      
 fences of barbed wire. Farm land is   
 used mainly for dairying{70%}and      
 sheep rearing{20%}with smaller        
 holdings of pigs and chickens.        </content>
