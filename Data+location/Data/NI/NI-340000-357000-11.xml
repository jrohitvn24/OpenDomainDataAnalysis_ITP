		<title>11RECENT CHANGES IN SAINTFIELD</title>
		<content>   In thirty years Saintfield has      
 become bigger,noisier and busier.The  
 style and size of the houses being    
 built has changed.Years ago they were 
 much smaller and there were fewer of  
 them.Many people have moved to        
 Saintfield because it is a quiet town 
 and the number of shops has increased 
 to cater for them.                    
   Thirty years ago girls would never  
 have gone to school wearing trousers, 
 and boys would have had short hair.   
                                       
   The Health Centre site used to be   
 stables for the horses of the people  
 who came to church in the early 1900's
 ,but the church sold the site to the  
 Health Board,and a modern Health      
 Centre and Library was built in 1971. 
 Before this,the patients would have   
 gone to the doctors own home,where he 
 had his surgery.                      </content>
