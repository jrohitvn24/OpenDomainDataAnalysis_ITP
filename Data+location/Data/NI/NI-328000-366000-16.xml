		<title>16A SCHOOLGIRL'S SUNDAY</title>
		<content> On Sunday morning I woke up at        
 nine-thirty, had my breakfast and then
 got ready for church. We left the     
 house at ten-twenty and arrived at    
 ten-thirty. At eleven O'clock the     
 service began. After the first hymn,  
 the canticles, tthe lessons and the   
 announcements we sang a childrens'    
 hymn and then went out to Sunday      
 School. Here we practiced for         
 childrens' day. After church we went  
 home for our Sunday lunch, and then   
 our cousins came to play with us until
 five-thirty. After tea we played      
 Monopoly and Twister until nine       
 o'clock, when we went to bed.         
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
