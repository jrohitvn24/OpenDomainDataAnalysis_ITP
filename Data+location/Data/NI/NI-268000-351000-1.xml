		<content>   The area of study undertaken by our 
 class can be described as rural.      
 There are many hills resulting from   
 melting ice depositing sand and       
 gravel.  These are often used for     
 quarries.                             
   Part of the area is made up of      
{Rehaghy Mountain}which is of little   
 agricultural  value and is often      
 covered with bracken, gorse and rough 
 pastures.  Further down the slopes the
 quality of the land improves, giving  
 way to more intensive beef and dairy  
 farming and, consequently an          
 increase in the number of homesteads. 
   Historically, the area has evidence 
 of past habitation, namely the        
 hill-top{Raths}which probably date    
 back to the{Iron-age period}in        
 Ireland.                              
   There are a number of small glacial 
 lakes, popular with fishermen, nearby </content>
