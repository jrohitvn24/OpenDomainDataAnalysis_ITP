 All the children interviewed thought  
 that this was a good area in which to 
 go to school and to live. Most thought
 that the local surroundings were      
 pleasant and the standard of living   
 above average.                        
 One thought that occured to almost all
 was the lack of any decent playground 
 facility in the area. This was blamed 
 on the areas proximity to{LISBURN}and{
{BELFAST}where such provision is very  
 adequate,especially in the better     
 suburbs and the re-development areas. 
 This proximity was,however,thought to 
 be very handy in providing access to a
 wide range of shops and other leisure 
 services.                             
 Teenagers complained particularly     
 about the total lack of youth-club    
 provision in the area.They said that  
 any local vandalism was due to this.  </content>
