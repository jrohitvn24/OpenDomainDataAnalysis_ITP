		<content> Due to the infertile nature of the    
 land there is a greater proliferation 
 of flora and fauna in this area.      
 Deciduous trees are numerous and      
 coniferous trees have been planted by 
 foresters on designated land.  In     
 Fathom a field of rhodendrons and one 
 of blackberry bushes can be found.    
 The blackberries are used by the local
 population for jam-making.  Wild      
 flowers such as primroses, foxgloves, 
 violets, bluebells, dandelions and    
 daisies are seen frequently.  Whin    
 bushes are dispersed throughout the   
 area and heather is found on the      
 slopes of the surrounding hills.  Many
 wild goats, rabbits and foxes are     
 present, and pheasants and            
 wood-pigeons are shot for sport for   
 the hunting season.  The water rats'  
 habitat is the mud-flats and swans are
 frequently seen swimming in the Canal.</content>
