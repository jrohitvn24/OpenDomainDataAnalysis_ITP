   The town was a little smaller than  
Limavady though it was very clean and  
bright as the townpeople took great    
pride in their surroundings.           
    The school was about the same size 
as St Mary's but only had about one    
third the pupils. The floors were      
carpeted and there were coffee         
machines in the corridor. Classes were 
small; only twenty on average.         
    There was no vandalism in the      
school and the pupils were able to     
address the teachers by their first    
names.                                 
     Children do sit exams but the     
teacher gives all a mark and no-one    
fails !
