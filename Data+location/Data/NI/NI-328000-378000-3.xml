		<content> Employment provision within the area  
 covers only a few different           
 categories: farming; quarrying;       
 licensed trade. The farms in the area 
 are medium sized but the type of land 
 limits the use to which it may be put-
 generally rough pasture land, which   
 may be used only for the grazing of   
 cattle and sheep. There are, however, 
 some small areas used for hay and     
 silage.                               
     Most of the quarries (there were  
 probably only about six working mines 
 in the area originally ) are now      
 abandoned, with only two major sites  
 still being worked to any great       
 extent.                               
     The only other source of          
 employment in the area is a           
 restaurant/public house - The Swiss   
 Chalet, which provides work for about 
 15 people only 4 of whom are full-time</content>
