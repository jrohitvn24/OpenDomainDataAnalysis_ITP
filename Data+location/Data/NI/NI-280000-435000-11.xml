		<content> Flowerfield Arts Centre is on the     
 Coleraine Road in Portstewart. The    
 house was built in 1828. The Coleraine
 Borough Council bought it and opened  
 it to the public in 1980 as an Arts   
 Centre. Now there is a full programme 
 to suit all tastes.                   
  Flowerfield entertains children by   
 giving puppet shows. There are classes
 in pottery making,toy making,arts and 
 crafts,music making and photography.  
  There are exhibitions of work done at
 the centre and items may also be      
 bought.                               
  Twenty-three staff work there. Three 
 are full time and the rest are part   
 time.                                 
  The grounds around the centre are    
 attractively laid out with a play area
 for children and picnic tables where  
 people can admire the flowers while   
 they eat.                             </content>
