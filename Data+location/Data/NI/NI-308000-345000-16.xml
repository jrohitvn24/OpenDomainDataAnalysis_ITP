 Most households own one or more cars, 
 which often doubles as a load         
 _carrying vehicle or for pulling a    
 small trailer. It also carries the    
 family to shop, school, church and on 
 pleasure and social occasions.        
    Our road area has twenty_three     
 kilometres of narrow roads (three     
 metres wide) winding around the       
 drumlins. Four kilometres of double   
 carriagway links Banbridge and Scarva 
 and is the bus route of six return    
 services each weekday.                
    All roads have a good tarmaced     
 surface. Only the remains of the      
 Banbridge _ Scarva railway line       
 exists, having closed down in 1959.   
    Traffic volumes are light and      
 related to the movements of the       
 residents.
