		<title>20Compiling Domesday Dungiven</title>
		<content> The information about the Dungiven    
 area was compiled by {Dermot Beatty}  
 and his 1985 {Primary Seven}class from
{St.Canice Primary School.}They        
 received invaluable help from many    
 local people,some of whom came to     
 visit the school and talked to the    
 children about their work.Other       
 information was obtained by visiting  
 people in their homes.Thanks are due  
 to the following people:              
{Rev.Stanley Bourke   Ms.M.Broderick   
{Mrs.Carmel Harkin    Mrs.Sheila Heaney
{Mr.John Henry        Mr.S.Mc.Closkey  
{Mrs.K.Mc.Keever }   {Mrs.J.Mc.Taggart 
 Collecting Domesday information proved
 a worthwhile educational project,     
 giving the children an insight into   
 their community and gaining them      
 experience in speaking to and         
 listening to adults.
