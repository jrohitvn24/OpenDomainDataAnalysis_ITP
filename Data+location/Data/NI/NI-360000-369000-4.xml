		<title>04Ballywalter-Flax Farming</title>
		<content>    A farmer outside Ballywalter last  
 year grew 25 acres of flax for linen  
 making.This year he has 50 acres.We   
 ,in Nothern Ireland,started growing   
 flax again two years ago.Lastyear we  
 grew 500 acres and this year we are   
 growing 1000 acres.                   
    We started growing flax here       
 because we found a new way of retting 
 it before it is made into yarn.       
 Northern Ireland has a good climate   
 for growing flax and there have always
 been flax spinning companies.         
    We used to grow flax but stopped in
 1949.Most of it was grown during the  
 two world wars as much of the cloth   
 was used by the army for clothing.    
    The linen was also used for the    
 wings of aeroplanes.Now it is very    
 popular for making clothes.
