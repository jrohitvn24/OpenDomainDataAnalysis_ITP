		<content> THE NAMES OF THE FARMERS ARE THE ONLY 
 THING UNCHANGED SINCE THE PLANTATION  
 OF ULSTER.AT THAT TIME PROTESTANTS    
 FROM SCOTLAND LIKE THE LOWRYS,COWANS, 
 MC KEANS,COLHOUNS,CAME AS TENANTS TO  
 THE MARQUIS OF HAMILTON,AND THEIR     
 ANCESTORS STILL FARM THESE LANDS,WITH 
 ONLY 5% OWNED BY CATHOLICS.IN RECENT  
 YEARS FARMS HAVE INCREASED IN SIZE    
 FROM AN AVERAGE OF 30 ACRES OR LESS TO
 AN AVERAGE OF 80 ACRES,WITH A FEW     
 FARMS OF AROUND 300 ACRES.THE MORE    
 PROSPEROUS FARMERS HAVE BOUGHT OUT THE
 LESS EFFICIENT.THE SIZE OF FIELDS HAS 
 ALSO INCREASED,ONE FIELD IN THE AREA  
 IS 50 ACRES.LAND USE AND EMPLOYMENT   
 PATTERNS HAVE ALSO CHANGED,FLAX,BARLEY
 OATS AND POTATOES WERE IMPORTANT,BUT  
 NOW THE MAIN CROP IS GRASS TO FEED    
 BEEF AND DAIRY CATTLE WITH BARLEY THE 
 ONLY GRAIN GROWN.
