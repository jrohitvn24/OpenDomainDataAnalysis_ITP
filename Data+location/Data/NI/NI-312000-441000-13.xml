		<title>13BON_NA_MARGY:THE BLACK NUN</title>
		<content> A RUDE OLD PERFOUNDED CROSS STANDS AT 
 THE WEST END OF THE CHURCH,WHERE THE  
 BEAUTIFUL DOOR ONCE STOOD,AND IT IS   
 SAID TO MARK THE GRAVE OF JULIA MAC   
 QUILLIN, "{THE BLACK NUN}", OF BON-NA-
 MARGY AT HER SPECIAL REQUEST,SHE WAS  
 BURIED AT THE DOORWAY SO THAT ALL WHO 
 ENTERED SHOULD TREAD UPON HER GRAVE.  
 SHE ALSO REQUESTED THAT COFFIN WHICH  
 MIGHT BE USED TO CARRY HER BODY TO THE
 GRAVE SHOULD NOT BE INTERRED,BUT GIVEN
 TO THE NEXT POOR PERSON WHO DIED, AND 
 THAT SHE SHOULD BE BURIED WITHOUT A   
 COFFIN.                               
  IT SEEMS THAT JULIA WAS MORE FEARED  
 THAN LIKED.MANY WEIRD LEGENDS STILL   
 EXSIST OF HER.AFTER{THE BLACK NUN'S}  
 POOR WICKED SISTER DIED SHE BEGAN TO  
 CARE FOR THE SICK AND NEEDY AS SHE    
 REALISED THAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN    
 WICKED IN NOT PRAYING FOR HER SISTER.
