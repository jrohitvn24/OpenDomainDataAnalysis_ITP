		<content> Rathenraw is the main{Housing Estate} 
 in our area.Houses are rented and the 
 estate is managed by the Northern     
 Ireland Housing Executive.The estate  
 has been well built with suitable open
 space and local services for the      
 residents.There is also a Tenants'    
 Association.However{vandalism}is a    
 serious problem.Of 630 houses on the  
 estate,over 120 are now empty and     
 boarded up.The district heating scheme
 has been stopped because it was too   
 expensive.                            
{Rural housing}takes the form of solid 
 stone farmhouses or modern bungalows  
 built by those who wish to live in the
 peace of the countryside.Some of the  
 latter cost over Â£60,000.             
 Hungry Hall is an example of a large  
 stone house which was formerly the    
 dwelling of an estate owner.
