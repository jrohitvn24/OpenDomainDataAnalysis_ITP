		<title>14COMPRESSED RUBBISH-RATHGAEL</title>
		<content> Bangor,as a sea-side town,caters for  
 many day trippers. There is a lot of  
 litter about because people use the   
 carry-out food shops. There are litter
 bins but some people don't put their  
 litter in them. This is why you see   
 road cleaners,who have to get up at   
 about 5 o'clock, clearing up rubbish  
 on the streets. The litter goes into  
 bin lorries which crush it up. The    
 lorries go to Rathgael Works Depot.The
 rubbish is tipped into a crusher there
 A man up in a box works the controls .
 Water sprays down on the rubbish as   
 it goes in and there are also plastic 
 flaps on the doorway to stop the dust 
 flying about. The rubbish goes into a 
 hopper and it is packed up tight in a 
 skip. A lorry takes the skip to       
 Duncrue Street and dumps the rubbish  
 on the shores of Belfast Lough. Smelly
 gas is sent out as it rots.  C.PRINGLE</content>
