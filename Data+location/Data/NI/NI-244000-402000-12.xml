 of them is for Catholics with 75      
 pupils on roll,employing 3 teachers.  
 The other school is for non-catholics 
 with a staff of 6 and an enrolment of 
 120.Many of the children attending    
 both schools are transported by school
 buses.Both schools open at 9.15am and 
 close at 3pm with a 15minute break in 
 the morning and half an hour for      
 lunch.                                
 School meals are made in kitchens     
 attached to both schools.A school meal
 can be bought for 60p daily but approx
 60% of the children have a free dinner
 due to their parents circumstances.
