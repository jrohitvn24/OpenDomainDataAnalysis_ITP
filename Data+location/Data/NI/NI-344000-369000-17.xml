   Comber Health Centre is a small and 
 pleasant building.  There are 5       
 doctors, 3 nurses, 3 welfare workers, 
 1 dentist, 1 chiropodist, 5           
 receptionists and 1 speech therapist. 
                                       
   It serves roughly 6,000 people.     
 Each worker has his own room or       
 office. There is also a reception area
 and waiting room.  Most people are    
 happy with the clinic but some prefer 
 the other Comber doctors because they 
 can get appointments the same day and 
 always see the same doctor.  In the   
 health centre, there is a 24_hour care
 system for illness and for social     
 problems (like one_parent families),  
 and preventative medical care.        
                                       
   I thought it was a very friendly    
 place.                                </content>
