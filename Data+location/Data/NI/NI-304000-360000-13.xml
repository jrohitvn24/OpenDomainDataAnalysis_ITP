		<content>  The fishing rights of Lough Neagh are
 owned by the Toome Eel Fishing Company
 and licences are issued only by them. 
  There are about 8 licenced fishing   
 boats in the Lurgan area.They fish    
 mainly for eels between May 1st and   
 Oct.31st.At other times of the year   
 they catch perch,which are a delicacy 
 on the Continent,pollen and trout.    
  Eels are caught by using a long line 
 with hooks on it,or by net.The eels   
 are marketed through the Toome Eel    
 Fishing Company.They are shipped live 
 to the Continent,where the most       
 lucrative market is Germany,followed  
 by Holland and France.                
  Pollution,mainly from the Sewage     
 Works,has made the condition of the   
 Lough deteriorate badly recently.The  
 Government is building plants to take 
 the phosphates out of the water.
