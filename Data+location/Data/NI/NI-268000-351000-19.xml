 they can manage themselves without    
 outside help.  They usually have a job
 and the farm is just a pastime.  They 
 carry on a variety of farming         
 enterprises such as beef rearing,     
 dairy farming and growing crops like  
 barley, oats and potatoes.  Hay and   
 silage are also made for winter feed. 
   Many of the menfolk work in the     
{Ulster Defence Regiment, Police}or the
{Police Reserve.} The wages are high in
 these jobs because their lives are in
