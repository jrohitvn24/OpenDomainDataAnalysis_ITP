		<content>     Some farmers,but few in this      
 district cut silage.It is cut in      
 Summer like hay.A silorator first cuts
 the grass and then blows it into a    
 trailer following behind.The grass is 
 put in a pit,covered up and left to   
 mature.                               
     In the Autumn farmers sometimes   
 plough their fields to reseed them for
 hay or silage the following year.This 
 is the time when the farmers sell     
 their calves in the local market.They 
 also get ready the outhouses in which 
 they keep the calves which they don't 
 sell during the Winter.               
     In the Winter farmers feed the    
 cattle that are out with the hay and  
 silage  although some farmers bring in
 their cattle for the bad weather.     
 Winter is also the time for doing jobs
 like hedging and fencing.Some building
 and mending of outhouses is also done.</content>
