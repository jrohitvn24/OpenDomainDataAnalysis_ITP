		<content> Times have changed a lot from my      
 grandfather's day, who was born in    
 1908 . When it comes to education ,I, 
 born in 1974 will have a free         
 education until I am sixteen and then 
 I can continue in {Further Education} 
 with a {University }career, as my     
 cousins have done, completely free if 
 I can gain a{scholarship}. My         
 grandfather on the other hand only    
 went to school for a few years because
 he was needed to work at home like so 
 many other girls and boys in his day. 
 They left school at 10 or 11 years of 
 age. My grandfather used a slate and  
 chalk and had very few school books. I
 have lots of books to use: {          
{dictionaries, atlases, encyclopaedias 
{etc}. My grandfather walked to school 
 in his bare feet for most of the year.
