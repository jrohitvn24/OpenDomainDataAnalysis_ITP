		<title>13CLADY FARM</title>
		<content> rope had come off.We went into a field
 which had a bull and Charolais with   
 their calves.We went into another     
 field with more Charolais cattle.After
 we saw the cattle we went into a shed.
 Mr.Simpson has a barrel which contains
 bulls' semen.It is used for Artificial
 Insemination.It is stored in liquid   
 Nitrogen. It could last for centuries!
  Mr.Simpson shows his cattle at       
 Balmoral,Ballymena and Antrim shows. I
 think he loves his work as a farmer or
 he would not have shown us round his  
 farm with such enthusiasm.
