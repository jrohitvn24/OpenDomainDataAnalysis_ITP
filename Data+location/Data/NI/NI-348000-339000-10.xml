		<title>10GAMES FOR CHILDREN</title>
		<content> There are many games played by boys   
 and girls.They fall into two          
 categories,indoor for wet days,and    
 outdoor for dry days.Indoor games     
 include many board games e.g. ludo,   
 draughts,snakes and ladders etc.There 
 are other games such as "I spy",where 
 one child gives others the initial    
 letter of an object which he can      
 see.They then try to guess,in         
 turn,which object he has seen.The     
 child who guesses correctly then has  
 the opportunity to "spy" something    
 else.Outside the main game for boys is
 football while the girls like to play 
 hop-scotch,to skip or play            
 rounders.All of the children like to  
 play "chasies" which means to chase   
 each other.If a child is caught it is 
 then his turn to chase.Children like  
 to invent their own games and make up 
 rules as they go along.               </content>
