		<title>06THE FAIRY THORN</title>

 In our area there are small trees     
 known as{'Fairy Thorns'.}They are     
 really thorn bushes growing all alone 
 in the middle of fields. People       
 believe that the bushes are the{homes}
 of the fairies, and, if anyone tries  
 to cut them down or damage them, it is
 likely he will die young, or become   
 seriously ill. He may lose things he  
 has worked hard to get- his cattle may
 die, or his house go on fire. All this
 is said to be the work of fairies     
 paying back for damaging fairy        
 property.                             
 Many of these bushes grow in{awkward} 
{places}for the farmers, yet few       
 farmers would dare interfere with     
 them. They think it is not worth the  
{risk.}                                </content>
