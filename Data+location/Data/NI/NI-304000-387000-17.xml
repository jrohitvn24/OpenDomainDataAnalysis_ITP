		<content> THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CHANGES IN THE   
 LAST 50 YEARS IN THIS AREA.           
 FARMING HAS BEEN MADE EASIER WITH THE 
 INTRODUCTION OF THE TRACTOR AND OTHER 
 MACHINERY. THE HORSE HAS GONE AND THE 
 BLACKSMITH'S FORGE AT CREGGAN CORNER  
 NO LONGER EXISTS.                     
                                       
 THE COMING OF ELECTRICITY COMPLETELY  
 CHANGED THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE. HOUSES
 WERE LIT BY LAMPS, WASHING WAS DONE BY
 HAND, COWS WERE MILKED BY HAND ETC.   
 AND THE HURRICANE LAMP WAS            
 INDISPENSIBLE FOR ALL OUTSIDE WORK    
 AROUND THE FARMYARD.                  
                                       
 EVERYONE CHURNED  AND MADE THEIR OWN  
 BUTTER AND ALL BREAD WAS BAKED ON THE 
 GRIDLE OVER THE HEARTH. THE WEEKLY    
 VISIT TO THE TOWN FOR SHOPPING, IN THE
 HORSE AND CART WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF   
 THE WEEK.                             </content>
