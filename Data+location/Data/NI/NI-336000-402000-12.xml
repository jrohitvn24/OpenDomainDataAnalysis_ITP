		<title>12TOURISM IN THE LARNE AREA</title>
		<content> There is one  hotel in this  area with
 others within a radius of  Larne.  The
 town has been described as the{Gateway
{to Ulster }and has become popular with
 motorists who can drive on in Scotland
 and  drive off  to explore  the scenic
 attractions of County Antrim.         
                                       
 Leaving Larne is the{Antrim Coast Road
 with cliffs and splendid sea views. It
 leads to the beautiful{Glens of Antrim
 carved out by  ice where  streams fall
 over waterfalls.                      
                                       
 A short distance in  another direction
 beyond a picturesque village of{Glynn,
 is the finest Norman Castle in Britain
 at{Carrickfergus.                     
{                                      
 The rest of  Ulster is only an hour or
 two away from Larne by car.
