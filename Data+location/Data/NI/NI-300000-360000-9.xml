		<title>09EFFECT OF RIVER POLLUTION</title>
		<content> Man has changed the chemical          
 composition of the water.Sewage is    
 treated and discharged into the Lough.
 Drains and rivers contain silage and  
 slurry effluent.The enrichment has    
 led to an unpleasant scum of algae.   
       This algae feeds many aquatic   
 animals such as {waterfleas,mussels,  
{snails and worms.}One of the most     
 frequent bottom dwellars is the larvae
 of various species of non_biting      
 midges known as the{Lough Neagh Fly .}
 The adult female lays eggs on the     
 surface of the lake in summer,these   
 sink to the bottom,hatch,feed on      
 algae,twelve months later the pupae   
 rise to the surface and the adults    
 emerge and fly away.                  
        {Eels,perch,roach,bream,pollen 
{and trout}feed on water creatures such
 as {Flies,larvae  and plankton.
