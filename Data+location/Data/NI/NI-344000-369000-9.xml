		<content>   Comber Police Station is a branch   
 station of Newtownards.  The Comber   
 Police station has 15 policemen and 2 
 sergeants.  The policemen are quite   
 busy dealing with petty robberies and 
 squabbles between families in the     
 neighbourhood.                        
   Itinerants, pretending to be antique
 dealers, sometimes come to farms,     
 looking for a way to break in.  Two   
 robberies have taken place recently.  
   The police station has some offices 
 upstairs.  Downstairs, there is a rest
 room, a kitchen, a small cell for     
 drunk persons, an armoury room and a  
 reception area, where radio calls can 
 be heard coming in.                   
   The policemen deal with a lot of car
 accidents. All the telephone calls    
 that come in are written in a large   
 book.  Comber is popular for policemen
 because it is considered safe.        </content>
