 A FEW YEARS AGO A CENTRAL CLINIC WAS  
 OPENED IN THE TOWN. THIS PROVIDES A   
 VARIETY OF FACILITIES. THE LOCAL      
 GENERAL PRACTITIONERS OPERATE FROM IT 
 INSTEAD OF FROM THEIR PRIVATE HOMES,AS
 FORMERLY. THERE ARE SEVEN DOCTORS AND 
 SIX NURSES.                           
 THE NURSES, WITH ADVICE FROM THE      
 DOCTORS, OPERATE A TREATMENT ROOM     
 WHERE MINOR INJURIES OR AILMENTS CAN  
 BE LOOKED AFTER. ANYTHING MORE SERIOUS
 IS SENT ON TO THE CASUALTY DEPARTMENT 
 OF THE HOSPITALS IN EITHER DUNGANNON  
 OR MAGHERAFELT, BOTH TEN MILES AWAY.  
  THERE IS ALSO A SECTION FOR TREATMENT
 OF EXPECTANT MOTHERS AND BABIES.      
  SO FAR THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT FOR    
 DISPENSING MEDICINES OR PRESCRIPTIONS.
 HOWEVER ONE OF THE MORE ENTERPRISING  
 CHEMISTS IN THE TOWN HAS OPENED A     
 BRANCH 100 METRES DOWN THE STREET.    </content>
