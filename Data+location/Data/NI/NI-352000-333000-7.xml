		<content> funny.Afterwards Mrs. mc Donagh       
 explained the amount of work it       
 takes to stage a play.Besides the     
 actors having to learn all their      
 lines lots of people are needed       
 backstage to help with the lighting,  
 make_up,comstumes,stage scenery       
 and of course a prompter in case      
 the actors forget their lines.        
 Although  the play is only on for     
 one night it takes the drama group    
 three nights.They set up their stage  
 and rehearse on the first night,      
 the second night is the play and on   
 the third night they have to clear    
 the props away.Being in the drama     
 group means alot of work but Mrs.     
 mc  Donagh and Mr. mc Donagh love     
 it.They enjoy going round different   
 places and soon the Lighthouse        
 Players are going to the Leisure      
 Centre in Newcastle for three nights  </content>
