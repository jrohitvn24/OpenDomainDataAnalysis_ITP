		<title>05CARRICKFERGUS RESERVOIRS.</title>
		<content> By 1900 The Belfast and District Water
 Commissioners had acquired nearly 2000
 acres of land which drained into the  
 reservoirs around Carrickfergus.      
 Almost all the farmhouses and         
 buildings had been levelled.  Since   
 1882 Carrickfergus has a free supply  
 of 40,000 gallons of water per day.   
                                       
      From the early l950's up to their
 closures in 1981, Courtaulds and      
 I.C.I. were using up to 1,000,000     
 gallons of water a day.  At present   
 30% of water from Woodburn reservoir  
 is used in the Carrickfergus area with
 70% being piped to Belfast.  The      
 Woodburn Forest Reservoir covers 87   
 acres and Dorisland l0 acres.         
 Dorisland acts as the catchment and   
 pumping area for the other two.   The 
 reservoirs today provide a wide       
 variation in fishing.                 </content>
