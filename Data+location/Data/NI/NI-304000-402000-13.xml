		<title>13HOUSES IN GALGORM</title>
		<content>  In Galgorm Village there are five    
 housing estates which are quite       
 modern. In the estates the types are  
 detached; semi_detached, bungalows,   
 flats and terraced. There are two     
 houses at Galgorm Corner which were   
 once a Boys'School built in 1873 and a
 Girls' School built in 1878 by John   
 Young of Galgorm Castle who died in   
 1915.                                 
  In the middle of the village there   
 are two lovely thatched houses which  
 are also being preserved. Beyond these
 a housing estate is being built. A    
 modern house is built for a family of 
 four or five with two reception rooms,
 a kitchen, three bedrooms and a       
 bathroom. Most of these houses have   
 gardens front and back.
