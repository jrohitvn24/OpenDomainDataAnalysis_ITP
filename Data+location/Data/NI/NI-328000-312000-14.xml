		<content> STAINLESS STEEL PLUGS ARE INSERTED    
 INTO BOTH THE HOLES IN THE MONUMENT   
 AND CORRESPONDING HOLES IN THE BASE,  
 AND THEN CEMENTED IN PLACE.  SOME     
 MONUMENTS ARE NOT POLISHED, GIVING THE
 NATURAL LOOK OF A ROCK TAKEN FROM THE 
 GROUND.                               
 AFTER COMPLETION TO THE ORDER         
 SPECIFICATIONS THE MONUMENTS ARE      
 PACKED WITH CARDBOARD ON PALLETS,     
 LOADED ONTO A LORRY AND TAKEN TO THE  
 CUSTOMER FOR LETTERING AND ERECTION.  
 GRANITE IS A VERY HARD, HEAVY MATERIAL
 REQUIRING SPECIALIST MACHINERY TO     
 PROCESS AND HANDLE.  MOST OF THIS IS  
 MADE EITHER IN GERMANY OR ITALY WHERE 
 THE GRANITE INDUSTRY IS PROMINENT.    
 FRANCE IS GRADUALLY GAINING IMPORTANCE
 IN THE MANUFACTURE OF MACHINERY       
 ESPECIALLY POLISHING MACHINES, BUT    
 BRITAIN MAKES NO MACHINES APPLICABLE  
 TO THE INDUSTRY.                      </content>
