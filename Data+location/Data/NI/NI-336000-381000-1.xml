		<content> WHITEABBEY AREA, NEWTOWNABBEY         
 The area taken in by this block is    
 almost covered by Belfast Lough.  The 
 small portion of land is Whiteabbey   
 Village and a residential area on the 
 fringes of the village, a busy main   
 road and a large parkland area.  The  
 residential nature of the area has    
 assumed importance over the past 20   
 years as land became available for    
 house building and buyers took the    
 advantage of a quiet area within reach
 of Belfast.The Village has a variety  
 of shops which are mainly used by the 
 locals.                               
  A new road from Belfast to           
 Carrickfergus by-passes the village.  
 It runs parallel to Loughshore Park   
 which is a popular recreational area. 
 Places of note in the area are        
 Rosstulla Special School, Newtownabbey
 Boat Club and the Edenmore Hotel.     </content>
