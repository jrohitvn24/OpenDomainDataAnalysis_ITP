		<title>06THE MUSHROOM FACTORY</title>
		<content>   The mushroom factory is at Knockboy 
 Broughshane and is owned by{Mr.Samuel 
{Kernohan}of Knockboy House.           
   There are 21 people working there,  
 some of whom are part time and some   
 full time.When the mushrooms are      
 picked they are put in baskets and    
 sold to local shops and restaurants.  
 Also they are driven daily to         
 Ballymena and Coleraine,and shipped to
 Birmingham,Glasgow and Liverpool.     
   The mushrooms are grown in very     
 humid conditions and as the           
 temperature rises they grow more      
 rapidly.They are grown in large trays 
 and are cut when they reach a certain 
 size.The pickers cut the mushrooms    
 with penknives and must make sure     
 they are a standard size.             
   At present there are no plans for   
 expansion.                            
                                       </content>
