		<content> In our area there is very little      
 public entertainment. The Crossways   
 Public House provides most of the     
 entertainment and also some services  
 to the community. Public houses in    
 Northern Ireland are open from 1130 in
 the morning to 1130 at night, but     
 are closed on Sundays.                
 The Crossways has the only public     
 telephone. It sells newspapers and    
 vegetables, grown loally, when asked. 
 In September it has a festival. Every 
 week it has a regular programme. On   
 the first Wednesday of the month they 
 have an auction.                      
 In the summer the Crossway's Country  
 and Western Club hold barbeques and   
 dances outside.                       
 The owner took a local group to       
 America this year and they are now the
 main attraction.
