		<title>13THE OLD PRIORY CHURCH/1</title>
		<content>                                       
     The ruins of the Old Priory Church
 stand at the north-east side of       
 Holywood.  The site was formerly      
 occupied by a monastery dating about  
 640 A.D.  It was destroyed by the     
 Vikings in the ninth century.         
     At the close of the twelfth       
 century an Augustinian Abbey was built
 - the ruins are still to be seen in   
 the churchyard today.                 
     In 1306 the church at "Haliwode"  
 (early name) was valued at six marks  
 which was equivalent of four pounds.  
     Towards the end of the fifteenth  
 century the Abbey of Holywood passed  
 to Franciscan rule under which it     
 remained until its dissolution by     
 Henry VIII in 1541.                   
     In 1572 Sir Brian MacPhelim       
 0'Neill burnt the old Priory and it   
 lay in ruins.                         </content>
