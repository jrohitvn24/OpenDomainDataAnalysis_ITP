		<content> THEY VARY IN WEIGHT FROM 1 TON TO THE 
 12 TON MAXIMUM LIFTING CAPACITY OF    
 THE FORKLIFT TRUCKS.  THEY ARE SHIPPED
 INTO WARRENPOINT DOCKS AND TRANSPORTED
 BY LORRY TO KILKEEL.  THEY ARE THEN   
 SELECTED FOR SAWING.  THIS IS DONE BY 
 A LARGE BLOCK SAW WITH A 2.5 METRE    
 DIAMETER BLADE WHICH IS FULLY         
 AUTOMATIC AND CAN BE PROGRAMMED TO    
 CUT 24 HOURS PER DAY TO THE SIZE      
 REQUIRED.  THE SLABS ARE THEN TAKEN   
 FROM THIS SAW TO AN AUTOMATIC SURFACE 
 POLISHER WHERE THEY ARE PLACED IN A   
 LONG LINE WITH APPROXIMATELY 10 - 12  
 SLABS IN A ROW.  THE POLISHING        
 OPERATION INVOLVES A SERIES OF WHEELS 
 OF DIFFERENT GRADES .  THE FIRST WHEEL
 USED IS COARSE AND TAKES OUT ANY      
 RIDGES IN THE SLAB.  WHEN THE SLAB IS 
 SMOOTH A NUMBER 2 WHEEL OF SMOOTHER   
 GRADE IS USED AND SO ON, USING A      
 NUMBER 3 AND A NUMBER 4.              </content>
