 boys in our class do with their pocket
 money. Most people in my class like   
 lemonade 2O boys said that is their   
 favourite.                            
    Crisps are the second most popular 
 thing with the boys in the class.  l9 
 boys said that is their favourite     
 thing to buy with their pocket money. 
    l7 people in the class like chips  
 as well as lemonade and crisps.  l3   
 boys in the class like chocolate.     
 Eleven boys in the class like buns.
