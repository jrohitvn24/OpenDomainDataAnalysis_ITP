		<content> The most common transport about this  
 area is a car.Almost everybody has a  
 car in this area.You would need a car 
 if you were goingto Londonderry or    
 Strabane as there is a very poor bus  
 service.It is eleven miles to         
 Londonderry and nine miles to         
 Strabane,However most people would go 
 to the Super-market to do their       
 shopping in Donemana,Londonderry or   
 Strabane.Shoes,clothes,meat and       
 household goods can be bought in      
 Donemana,but to get to furniture      
 shops,dentists,travel agents ,sports  
 shops it is necessary to go to        
 Strabane or Londonderry.The roads     
 about here are very narrow and have   
 alot of sharp bends.They are tarmac   
 and have alot of hills .Some lanes up 
 to houses have rough roads but some   
 are tarmac and some are concrete.     
 Some people have a motor bikes.       </content>
