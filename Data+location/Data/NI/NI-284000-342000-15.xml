		<content> The point-to-point races are held     
 annually in Farmacaffley.             
 The racing starts at 3.00p.m. with the
 hunt race, which is sponsored by      
 a local garage. This year it was      
 sponsored by JOSHUA WHITE LIMITED.    
 Although it is a small race meeting,  
 it still holds a lot of local         
 interest. There are 5 different races 
 held, which are the Hunt Race,        
 Leeman's Open Chase and Light Weight  
 Race.                                 
  Every half hour there is a different 
 race. They do two half circuits each  
 one of 2 miles. The fences must be    
 inspected by a representative from the
 Turf Club. Armagh Farmacaffley won the
 Point-to-point races the year before  
 last (1983). The fences are built by  
 Mark Bloomer. The secretary of the    
 Point-to-point races is Mr B. Dougan.
