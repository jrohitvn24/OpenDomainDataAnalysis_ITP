 area drained by the  R.Ravel bounded  
 on three sides by mountains to a      
 height of 1,600 feet  and opening     
 in the south to fat farming land      
 leading to Ballymena, the market      
 town eight miles away .  The land     
 formerly{moss and bog}has been        
  reclaimed especially during the years
 of the last war and more recently     
 encouraged by generous grants provided
 for less favoured areas. This marginal
  land in the foot hills is{rough      
{pasture and pasture}adequate for
