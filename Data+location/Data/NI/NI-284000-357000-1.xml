		<content> This intensively managed grassland is 
 approximately three kilometres from   
 Killyman and two kilometres from Moy. 
 The area is serviced by second class  
 and tertiary roads.                   
 The famrland is used for pasture or   
 for cutting as silage or hay. Farmers 
 concentrate on the  raising of dairy  
 and beef cattle, though some farmers  
 carry on sheep rearing and apple      
 growing.                              
 Killyman Co-operative and Agricultural
 Society is only manufacturer in the   
 area. Apart from their Creamery       
 activities of processing and          
 distributing milk, they manufacture   
 apple juice, fruit drinks and  butter.
 The Argory is a National Trust        
 property which has only recently been 
 taken over and opened up to the       
 public.
