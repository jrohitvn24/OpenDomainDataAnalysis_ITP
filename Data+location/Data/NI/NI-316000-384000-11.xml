		<title>11FARMING</title>
		<content> The main Farming occupation in the    
 block is rearing cattle, both for Beef
 and Dairy purposes. The main cattle   
 breeds being Friesian and Charolais   
 crossbreeds.                          
 Many of the fields in the region not  
 being used for direct grazing are also
 in grass for silage production        
 although there are some fields given  
 over to cereal production too.        
 Near to the Six Mile Water river there
 is an area known as the Nursery which 
 is given over to the commercial       
 production of seedling trees.  This   
 area is running down at present.      
 Also many fields in the North Eastern 
 portion of the block are used to      
 produce experimental crops, grass,    
 cereals, clover, root crops, etc.     
 These are owned by Greenmount         
{Agricultural College}which do all     
 types of Research on Agriculture.     </content>
