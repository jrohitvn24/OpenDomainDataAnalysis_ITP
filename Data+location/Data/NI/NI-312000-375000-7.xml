		<content>      Redlands is a big factory at the 
 bottom of the Largy Road.It has 30 men
 employed in the factory itself,and    
 about 30 salesmen.The factory makes   
 coloured roof tiles.Redlands also have
 two lorries and five fork lift trucks.
 They make about 30,000 tiles per day. 
      There are three main parts to the
 factory the{"LARGE"}plant the{"WEE"   
 plant as it is called and the{"RIDGE  
{HOUSE"}The tiles are made from cement,
 pit sand,lough sand,and colouring.The 
 colouring is the only thing which does
 not come from N,Ireland.It is imported
 from Germany.At the moment they are   
 building a new block of offices and   
 hope to get it finished at the end of 
 April 1985.My father who works for    
 Redlands starts work at 6.00 am and   
 finishes at 6.00 pm which I think is a
 very long day indeed.
