		<content> The forest covers 175 hectares        
 bordering Lough Neagh to the south and
 Shanes Castle to the east.It was      
 formerly the deer park for Shanes     
 Castle and was purchased from Lord    
 O'Neill in 1934 by the Ministry of    
 Agriculture.The area was planted with 
 conifers interspersed with broadleafed
 trees.The principal species used were 
 Norway Spruce and oak.The conifers    
 were planted to protect the           
 broadleaves and are now being felled  
 to give the oaks light and space.     
                                       
{TIMBER PRODUCTION:}Randalstown Forest 
 priduces about 1000 tonnes of timber  
 each year by a continuous cycle of    
 thinning,felling and replanting.      
   The timber is sold locally to       
 sawmills.It is either turned into pulp
 or fence posts.Norway Spruce is used  
 for constructing timber framed houses.</content>
