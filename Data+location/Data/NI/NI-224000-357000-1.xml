		<title>01The Area</title>
		<content>    This area is primarily rural. It   
 lies on the outskirts of a small      
 town,{Irvinestown.}The majority of the
 people in this area are involved in   
 farming, or travel to work in         
 Irvinestown or the two main urban     
 centres near us, Enniskillen and      
 Omagh.                                
    The landscape is typical of a lot  
 of Fermanagh, hills and dales. The    
 hills are mostly drumlins left after  
 the retreat of the ice-age. The area  
 receives a lot of rainfall and so     
 drainage is of great importance to    
 farmers. At the moment many farmers   
 are engaged in major reclamation and  
 drainage schemes. The E.E.C. and the  
 Dept. of Agriculture are offering good
 grants for this work. The area is     
 pleasant to live in, people are       
 friendly and most facilities are      
 available.                            </content>
