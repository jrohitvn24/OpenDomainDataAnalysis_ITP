		<content> Throughout this undulating area, which
 slopes from 120metres in the N.W.to   
 35metres in the S.E.,is a massive     
 network of field ditches or{shoughs. }
 These flow into the many streams which
 meander down to the R.Maine.The main  
 one is the{Straid Burn}which flows    
 through Ahoghill before being joined  
 by the{Rosebrook.}It's course S.E.from
 here is diverted by weirs into {mill  
{races}which once powered corn and flax
 mills which are derelict today.       
  The R.Maine which drains a vast part 
 of Co.Antrim is 25metres wide here as 
 it meanders through a flood plain     
 \mile wide on it's way south to {Lough
{Neagh.}                               
  In the S.E.corner is a low,flat      
 bogland area 1 mile square called {   
{Straid Moss}where {peat}is cut for    
 fuel.                                 
                                       </content>
