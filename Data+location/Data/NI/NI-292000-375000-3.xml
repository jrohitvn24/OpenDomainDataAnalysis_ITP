		<title>03ARDBOE AIR FIELD</title>
		<content> One of the main enviroumental features
 of our block is a{disused airfield}The
 airfield has been unused for some 30  
 years now but much of the perimeter   
 and runway tracks still survive ,as do
 several of the associated buildings.  
         This  airfield now known as   
{CLUNTOE}originated in 1940 when 35    
 families were requested to vacate     
 their homes and building began. From  
 1942 to 1944 two thousand ,two hundred
 and 94{American}soldiers were based   
 here.With the war's end the base was  
 closed but 1952 however it was        
 reopened after some quarter of a      
 millon pounds was spent on it.From    
 1952 until 1955 the base was then used
 as a training ground for the{R.A.F.   
 Finally its operational life came to a
 end in 1955 when it was closed down.  
     The influence of such an airfield 
 on life here has been lasting.        </content>
