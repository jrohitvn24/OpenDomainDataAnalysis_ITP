		<title>11AN HISTORIC EVENT</title>
		<content>    In the townland of Ballyarnet,an   
 event occured which was to have great 
 historical significance.In 1932 a     
 small, single engined aeroplane landed
 in a field at Ballyarnet. Out stepped 
 a young woman,the famous Amelia       
 Earhart.She had set off from America, 
 and 13hrs later,landed in a field at  
 Springfield, on land owned by a       
 Mr.Gallagher.It was due to a faulty   
 compass that she landed near Derry,as 
 she had intended landing in Paris.The 
 event at that time was recorded widely
 in the National and Local newspapers. 
 Many photographs of Amelia show       
 children who today have vivid memories
 of the event.This field is marked     
 today by a monument erected in 1982 to
 celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 
 1st solo flight over the Atlantic by a
 woman.
