		<content>   The{Rath}is located about 3 miles   
 from Aughnacloy, close to{Rehaghy     
{mountain. }The{Rath}was once used as a
{hill-top fort}so the enemy was easily 
 seen if they were going to attack, and
 had a{moat}around it for protection.  
   It is circular shaped with a hollow 
 centre.  The fort has been used by    
 Irish farmers in ancient times to     
 safe-guard their homes and livestock. 
 The fort has survived for hundreds of 
 years as the farmers who owned the    
 land never removed it from their      
 fields at Rehaghy although it now     
 serves no useful purpose.  Perhaps    
 they want to preserve this memory of  
 our ancient past.                     
   Today the{Rath}is surrounded by     
 trees such as Elms, Holly and Oak. In 
 the centre of the fort there are      
 various plants and flowers for example
 Primroses and violets.                </content>
