		<title>10INDUSTRY IN BANBRIDGE</title>
		<content>      Lying in a prosperous area       
 Banbridge finds it relatively easy to 
 attract industry, mostly in the       
 service sector. Opportunities in the  
 manufacturing sector are limited, the 
 main producers being JMJ Engineering, 
 Franklins (Badge Manufacturers),      
 Fergusons (Spinning), Autoplas        
 (Plastic Pipes). In the primary       
 sector, several farms are situated on 
 the Northern &amp; Eastern boundaries.    
 Some of this land may be allocated to 
 housing purposes in future years.  To 
 the north-east, Tullyraine Quarry     
 carries on an extensive business. In  
 the area, however, most people are    
 employed in the service sector:-shops 
 banking,insurance,estate agents, and  
 legal services.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
