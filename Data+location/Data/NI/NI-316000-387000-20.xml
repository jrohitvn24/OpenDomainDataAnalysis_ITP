		<content> Our particular square has no major    
{tourist attractions}of its            
 own,although there is beautiful       
 scenery and some ancient remains.     
 Therefore we conducted a survey of    
 pupils to discover their{holiday      
{habits.}                              
 About 60% of those questioned said    
 they hoped to go abroad on holidays   
 with Spain a popular destination.Other
 parts of the U.K.mainland were also   
 popular.                              
 30% said they hoped to go on a holiday
 somewhere in Northern Ireland.The     
 North Coast is always a big attraction
 with local people.                    
 About 10% of people said they had no  
 holiday plans at all.Lack of money    
 through unemployment is always a      
 problem.                              
 Many families enjoy{day trips}to local
 beauty spots.                         </content>
