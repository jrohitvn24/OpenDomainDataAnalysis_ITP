 themselves at polling stations with   
 their medical cards,driving licences, 
 passports,marriage certificates or    
 family allowance books.In the election
 results the Official Unionst Party    
 came first,the Demecratic Unionsts    
 came second,the Social Demecratic     
 Labour Party third, Sinn Fein fourth  
 and lastly the Irish Independent and
