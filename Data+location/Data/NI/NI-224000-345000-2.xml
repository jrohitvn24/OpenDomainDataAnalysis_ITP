		<content>{Interviewing A Farmer                 
  For an ordinary farmer in this area, 
 the days events are much the same     
 during the week except on Thursday    
 there is a slight alteration_Thursday 
 is market_day.                        
 On a normal day the farmer wakes at   
 7.30am every morning and before his   
 breakfast he goes out to milk the     
 cows.This used to be a very tedious   
 job until the invention of the milking
 machines which is a very prominent    
 piece of equipment to dairy farmers   
 both big and small.                   
 After his breakfast his routine starts
 again,although after the milking it   
 does not matter very much which order 
 the daily work is done.The farmer I   
 interviewed starts by walking around  
 the fields counting the farm animals  
 and observing them for any signs of   
 illness,                              </content>
