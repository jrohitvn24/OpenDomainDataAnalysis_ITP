		<title>15Tourist Idustry in Antrim</title>
		<content>   As you approach Antrim,you          
 immediately see Lough Neagh stretching
 into the distance.The Lough is the    
 largest fresh water lake in the       
 British Isles and offers a wide       
 variety of activities both to the     
 angler and boating enthusiast.        
   In recent years the council have    
 improved the Marina, and it is here   
 that the cruiser, "The Maid of        
 Antrim,"leaves for its trips around   
 the Lough.Teas and snacks can be      
 bought from the cafe at the Marina.   
   Leaving the Lough and driving       
 towards the town,we come to           
 Massereene Golf Club.This is an       
 eighteen hole course and provides     
 plenty of entertainment for keen      
 players.It is beautifully situated and
 many parts of it stretch down to the  
 waters edge.                          
                                       </content>
