 Rosstulla Special School caters for   
 those pupils aged 5-16 years who find 
 difficulty learning in ordinary       
 primary and secondary schools.  Such  
 children may not be able to speak,    
 hear or see properly or they may have 
 other handicaps.  Rosstulla provides a
 learning environment in which class   
 numbers are very small and the        
 teachers have more time to help each  
 pupil to try to overcome his or her   
 particular problems.                  
 The school, which was established in  
 1965, has three educational           
 departments.  The Assessment Unit has 
 14 places for 5-7 year old pupils.    
 This unit contains pupils who have    
 experienced difficulty in their early 
 school and who would appear to be     
 inappropriately placed in a Primary   
 School.                               </content>
