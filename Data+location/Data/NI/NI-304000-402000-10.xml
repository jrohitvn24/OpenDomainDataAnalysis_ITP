		<title>10THE VILLAGE OF GALGORM</title>
		<content>  Galgorm is situated on the River     
 Main, two and a half miles from       
 Ballymena. It is between Ballymena and
 Ahoghill which is two miles away. The 
 population is between 400 and 500.    
  There are four well known factories  
 which employ many people. The largest 
 factory is Gallahers specializing in  
 making cigars  and tobacco.           
  Galgorm has only four shops which are
 a Spar Supermarket, The Wine Lodge,The
 Antique Parlour and the Bakery.       
  The most important building in       
 Galgorm is the County Hall where      
 people are employed in Government     
 offices. Every day lots of people     
 visit County Hall to pay rates and    
 taxes and to have their driving       
 licenses renewed.                     
  Just down the road from here is      
 Galgorm Castle. It was built in 1649  
 by a Dr. Colvell who lived there.     </content>
