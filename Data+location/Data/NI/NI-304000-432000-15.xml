		<title>15MY UNCLE THE POSTMAN</title>
		<content>  My uncle Robert is a postman in Armoy
 and he works 6 days a week. He        
 delivers mail to the people up around 
 the Glenshesk Road, Lismoritty,       
 Mullaghduff and the Dry Arch. He goes 
 to work at 6.30am and he goes up to   
 Cusick's and sorts out the mail in the
 sorting office behind the shop. He    
 delivers mail to my best friend,Damian
 Mc Bride and there are three postmen  
 for the surrounding area. My uncle    
 Robert keeps any parcels he has for my
 house and takes them down when he has 
 finished work each day at about       
 1.00pm. He washes the van once every  
 week and he takes the van once every  
 month to get it serviced. He takes the
 papers to the people he delivers to on
 his run. Sometimes he plays for Armoy 
 Utd on Saturdays when he is not       
 working.Cusick's supermarket also has 
 the Post Office for Armoy inside it.  </content>
