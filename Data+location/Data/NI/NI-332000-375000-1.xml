		<content> The area we were given to study has   
 the new M2 running North-South nearly 
{splitting it in half.} To the east of 
 the motorway is the Belfast Lough,    
 Docks and Shipyard.  To the west is   
 where all the houses are, including   
 our school.  Facing our school is the 
 Grove Baths (at the moment the biggest
 in Belfast).  The three main parks in 
 our part of Belfast are Grove,        
 Cliftonville and St Marys Gardens.    
{To the NorthWest of the motorway}is   
 where most of the people live with big
 houses and big gardens which are      
 spaced by a couple of yards. Down our 
 way{(the southwest)}is a differant    
 story altogether because it's packed  
 full of streets and has hardly any    
 open spaces.
