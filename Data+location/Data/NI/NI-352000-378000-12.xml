		<title>12 Clydesdale Horses 2</title>
		<content> The day of the show means an early    
 start.He goes to shows as far away as 
 Limavady about 80 miles away.When they
 arrive the horses feet are washed     
 again and combed and rubbed until they
 are shining.The horses are judged in  
 the hand which means they are led in a
 halter.They are then put into harness 
 to be yolked in the farm cart to be   
 judged again.The biggest show the     
 Royal Ulster is held at Balmoral in   
 Belfast.There is a class for mares and
 foals,which I like to watch because   
 the foals are nice. The same          
 preparation goes into preparing the   
 horses for ploughing matches. They    
 also have to practise ploughing as    
 this is all done with tractors now.   
 Horses need to be matched in size and 
 colour to give the best effect. They  
 have to get used to walking and       
 pulling the plough together.          </content>
