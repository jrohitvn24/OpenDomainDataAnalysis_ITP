		<title>14FARMING IN ARDBOE</title>
		<content> The fields in our district are very   
 small and the{farms are small too.    
 Upto about  thirty years ago most of  
 the land was{tilled} but the land     
 cover survey shows that things have   
 changed. In those days the crops      
 were potatoes,oats,grass for its      
 seed and flax for the linen mills.    
 Now the only vegetables are a few     
 potatoes and the grain has been       
 changed to{barley.                    
 Most of the farms here are producing  
 milk.Very little hay is grown now.    
{Silage}has taken its place because    
 this is safer with the weather we get 
 .We do get a lot of rain.But the early
 cutting of the grass has destroyed the
 nests of a bird called the            
{corncrake}.None of us in school has   
 ever heard or seen this bird.Our      
 parents tell us that when they were   
 children its call told it was{summer. </content>
