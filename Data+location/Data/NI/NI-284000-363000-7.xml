		<content>      Today only a few houses in the   
 area are thatched -most of today's    
 houses are large slated bungalows or  
 two-storey detached houses. They have 
 four or five bedrooms, living rooms,  
 utility rooms, bathrooms, studies,    
 some houses even have their own sauna.
 The kitchens are luxurious with their 
 mahogany cupboards and all electronic 
 gadgets possible from{electric can    
{openers to dishwashers and microwave  
{ovens}. In contrast my grandfather    
 lived in a house with 2 bedrooms and a
 kitchen, where you cooked, ate and    
 relaxed, and a pantry which held the  
 food which was very scarce.           
      Most food was fresh from the land
 -potatoes, vegetables, butter, milk   
 and eggs. Today we eat anything from {
{American fried chicken to Chinese     
{curries}.
