		<content>  ONE WALL REMAINS FROM THE CHURCH     
 WHICH CONTAINS AN EAST WINDOW.THE RUIN
 IS ON STEEP LAND OVERLOOKING          
 BALLYCASTLE PIER AND THE AREA COVERED 
 BY OUR SQUARE.THE RUIN IS ON          
 MAGHERINTEMPLE ESTATE.THE ARCHED      
 WINDOW IS SHAPED LIKE A CROWN AND IS  
 STILL QUITE ACCURATE.THE WINDOW CAN BE
 FOUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL AND IS
 PARTLY COVERED IN GRASS AND FERN.THE  
 COLOURED STONES ARE FITTED CLOSELY    
 TOGETHER,BUT ARE NOT ALL THE SAME     
 SIZE.BELOW THE WINDOW THE STONES      
 BECOME VERY NARROW WHICH MUST HAVE    
 BEEN A TABLE OF SOME SORT AT ONE      
 TIME.THE WALL IS ALSO COVERED IN      
 GRASS,FERN AND MOSS.                  
  ONE STACK ALSO STANDS WHICH WAS PART 
 OF A SIDE WALL.AS THE CHURCH IS OUT IN
 THE OPEN,IT WAS USED  BY NEARBY       
 VILLAGERS.                            
                                       </content>
