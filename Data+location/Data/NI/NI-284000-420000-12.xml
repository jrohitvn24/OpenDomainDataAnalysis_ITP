		<title>12A DAY IN MY LIFE</title>
		<content>   I got up between seven and a half   
 seven and dressed. Then I got my      
 breakfast. A little while after       
 breakfast I got ready for school. I   
 got on my bicycle and shortly arrived 
 at school.When I got to school I went 
 out to play football which the P7's   
 won.                                  
   When the bus came we went in for    
 assembly.We went to our class to do   
 some work.At eleven o'clock we had    
 our break which was five minutes.At a 
 half twelve we went for our dinner.   
   After dinner we went out to play    
 football.Later on in the afternoon we 
 had handwork where we made boats out  
 of balsa wood.At a quarter past three 
 we went home.A few hours later we had 
 our tea and then we went outside and  
 played football until bedtime.
