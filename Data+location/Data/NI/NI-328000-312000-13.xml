		<content> THIS IS DONE BY AN AUTOMATIC MACHINE  
 WHICH, WHEN SET UP AND STARTED, MOVES 
 UP AND DOWN THE STONE ON ITS OWN,     
 UNTIL STOPPED BY THE OPERATOR.  HE    
 CHANGES THE POLISHING WHEELS JUST AS  
 ON THE SURFACE POLISHER.  WHEN THE    
 SIDES ARE FINISHED THE TOPS ARE NOW   
 POLISHED.  DEPENDING ON THE SHAPE THIS
 IS DONE EITHER BY A MACHINE FOR A     
 SIMPLE SHAPE, OR A MANUALLY WORKED    
 HAND POLISHER, FOR A MORE COMPLICATED 
 SHAPE.  THIS IS A HIGHLY SKILLED JOB  
 AND IT TAKES MANY YEARS TO TRAIN AN   
 OPERATOR TO BE ABLE TO POLISH HEART   
 SHAPED OR BOOK SHAPED MEMORIALS.      
 FINALLY THE BACK OF THE MONUMNET IS   
 POLISHED, LEAVING THE PIECE OF GRANITE
 COMPLETELY POLISHED.                  
 DOWEL HOLES ARE NOW DRILLED IN THE    
 BOTTOM OF THE MONUMENT AND THESE ARE  
 USED WHEN STANDING IT ON A BASE.
