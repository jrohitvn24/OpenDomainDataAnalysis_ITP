		<title>01BALLYGALLY/DRAIN'S BAY</title>
		<content> The{Ballygally/Drain's Bay}area is    
 very much split between{agriculture   
 and{tourism}. The area consists of 2  
 villages,Ballygally,(the larger),and  
 Drain's Bay, some scattered farms,    
 much agricultural land, a coastal     
 strip, golf course, and some public   
 land being developed as a country     
 park.                                 
 The area inland is very much given    
 over to agriculture, mainly dairying, 
 while the coastal strip caters more   
 for tourists.                         
 To the north of the area is the       
{village of Ballygally,with its hotel, 
{post office, youth hostel and sandy   
{beach.}Travelling south along the     
 coast road, we pass the{golf club,}the
 convalescent hospital and{Carnfunnock,
 soon to be a large country park.In the
 SE we reach the tiny{village of Drains
{Bay}and the picturesque{Black Arch .  </content>
