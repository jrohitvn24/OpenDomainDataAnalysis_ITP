		<content>     The{Valley Leisure Centre}is a    
 lovely area just below Cave Hill. It  
 is a large building surrounded by lots
 of playing fields. It is right on the 
 edge of Rathcoole housing estate on   
 the Church Road.                      
     There are many different things   
 inside it. There are three levels. On 
 the first level you can go swimming _ 
 there is a learner pool and a pool for
 swimmers. There is also a large hall  
 which is marked out for many sports   
 like,badminton,tennis or football.    
     On the second level there are     
 squash courts,a gym,viewing for the

 indoor bowling green,snooker and      
 darts. They also have facilities for  
 the handicapped. I'm a member of the
