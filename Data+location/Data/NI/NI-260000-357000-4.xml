		<content> Knock Crescent is a park in           
 Ballygawley Co.Tyrone N.I.It was built
 in the late nineteen sixties by       
 O'Hagan Brothers from Eskra.There     
 are thirty_two residential houses.Some
 houses are one storeyed.These are for 
 pensioners.Then there are three_      
 bedroom and some four_bedroom         
 houses.My friend Damien and I live in 
 Knock Crescent.There are eight garages
 in Knock Crescent.Damien's father and 
 my father both own garages for        
 putting their cars in.The council     
 men cut the grass about once a month. 
 We have to cut the grass ourselves in 
 our back gardens.There are plenty of  
 frogs to be seen when you are cutting 
 the grass.It was called Knock Crescent
 because of a neighbouring townland    
 called Knockonny on the Sixmilecross  
 road.
