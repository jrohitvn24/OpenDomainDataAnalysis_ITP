		<content> Drummond is a district on the         
 outskirts of Limavady that has its own
 cricket club and grounds.  It is only 
 about a mile away from my house, and  
 my daddy is a member of the team.  On 
 the road to the cricket club is the   
 Drenagh Saw Mills which gets its name 
 from the local estate, all of which is
 owned by the McCauslands.  Using the  
 wood from the forests around the town,
 it produces planking and wooden       
 fencing.  There is also a foundry     
 which was originally at Crossnadonnell
 and also owned by the McCauslands, but
 with several owners since.  It still  
 produces metal gates, animal troughs  
 etc. to this day.  At the moment they 
 are making a fishing boat with steel  
 plates.
