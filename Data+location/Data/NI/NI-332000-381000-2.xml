		<content>      {Newtownabbey}became a town in   
 1958. The motto of the town then was {
{"Septem in uno Surgent"}which means   
 "Seven shall rise as one". The "seven"
 are the villages of Whitehouse,       
 Whitewell, Whiteabbey, Monkstown,     
 Jordanstown,Glengormley and Carnmoney.
       In 1973 Newtownabbey was        
 re-organised to become one of the 26  
 local government Districts of N.I. Its
 motto then became{"Multi in uno       
{Resurgent"}or "Many shall re-arise as 
 one". The area now controlled by the  
 Council is over 34,000 acres.         
       On the 1st March 1977 the       
 Council was granted a{Royal Charter}  
 making it a{Borough}. Many hoped this 
 would see the beginning of a separate 
 identity for the area. This has not   
 yet happened and the region has no    
 real "heart" and retains the          
 identities of its constituent parts.  </content>
