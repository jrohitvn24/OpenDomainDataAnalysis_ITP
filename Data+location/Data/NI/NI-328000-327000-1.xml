		<content> This is a mountainous area stretching 
 from the headwaters of the River      
 Shimna to the Hare's Gap - a high pass
 through the ring of Mourne Mountains. 
 The main peak is Slieve Bearnagh      
 meaning gapped or broken mountain     
 because of its rocky tor-like summit. 
 Locally it is called the Devil's Bite 
 from its summit outline viewed from   
 the North. The other main peaks are   
 Slieve Meelbeg and Slieve Meelmore.   
 These names may be derived from the   
 Irish for small and large animals or  
 from 'mael' meaning bare.             
 All the mountains have glacially      
 smoothed outlines and are of Granite  
 with glacial till on their lower      
 slopes.                               
 The River Shimna (R of rushes) rises  
 in the SW corner of the block, flows  
 North. It is joined by the Trassey its
 main tributary, flowing N in square 4.</content>
