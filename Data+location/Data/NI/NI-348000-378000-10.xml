		<content>     {   HIDE AND GO SEEK              
 In this game you can have as many     
 people as you want. One person is "on"
 and all the others go and hide. The   
 person that is "on" stays in his den  
 and counts to 100 in 5's,then he says,
 "Here I come,ready or not", and goes  
 and looks for them. He looks all over 
 and the first one caught is "on". The 
 others can get back free to the den   
 while the person who is on is away    
 from it .                   AMY DUNCAN
     {   THE BIG BAD WOLF}             
 Many people can play. You choose one  
 person to be "on". All the others line
 up in a long line and say,"What's the 
 time Mr.Wolf?".The wolf turns round   
 and he might say,"Two o'clock" so they
 all take two steps. This goes on until
 the wolf decides to say,"Dinner time",
 when the children in the line must try
 not to be caught by the wolf. C.COBAIN</content>
