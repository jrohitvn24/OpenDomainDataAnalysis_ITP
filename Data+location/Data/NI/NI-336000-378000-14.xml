		<title>14THE OLD PRIORY CHURCH/2</title>
		<content> It was rebuilt about 1615 by Sir James
 Hamilton for use by both Presbyterians
 and Anglicans.  The latter had sole   
 occupancy of it from about 1640 until 
 1844 when it was finally abandoned and
 unroofed following the move of the    
 congregation to the new church at     
 Church Road.                          
      The church is a simple nave and  
 chancel structure, without an internal
 division, and with a two stage tower  
 at the west end.  The original        
 building was constructed of neatly cut
 blocks of honey-coloured cultra       
 sandstone, and was lit by only a few  
 small and narrow round-headed windows,
 much of this work still surviving,    
 especially on the north side.         
      In the late fifteenth century the
 east gable was completely             
 reconstructed.
