		<content> Apart from the main Christian         
 festivals, there are two main{events} 
 which are celebrated in this area as  
 in the whole of Northern Ireland.     
 l) Hallowe'en which is celebrated on  
 3lst October.  It was celebrated in   
 much the same way as Guy Fawke's day  
 in England with bonfires and fireworks
 but because of the situation in       
 Northern Ireland this aspect of the   
 celebration has been banned.          
 2) The other celebration is that of   
 the Battle of the Boyne in l690, every
 l2th July with large parades in which 
 several flute and pipe bands from the 
 block take part.  Also on the llth    
 July bonfires are lit as part of the  
 celebration.                          
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
