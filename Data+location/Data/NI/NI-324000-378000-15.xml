		<title>15A FARMER'S WIFE AT HOME</title>
		<content>  I get up every morning at 6.30 and   
 take a cup of tea before going out to 
 bring the cows in for milking. My     
 husband gets up shortly after 6.30 to 
 milk the cows. The milking begins     
 about 7.00 and finishes about 9.00.   
 Meanwhile, I leave my daughter to the 
 bus stop at 8.00 and then return home 
 to get my breakfast ready.            
  After breakfast, I feed the young    
 calves with milk and go down to the   
 fields to feed the older calves with  
 meal. I then tend to the pigs, giving 
 them meal and water and cleaning out  
 their sty.                            
  After this I come back to the house, 
 do the breakfast dishes and begin     
 getting the dinner ready. In the      
 afternoon I might do some gardening or
 mend some fencing if it is dry. If it 
 is wet, I will do some cleaning in the
 house.            Continued next page.</content>
