		<title>05HOUSING - FARM HOUSES</title>
		<content> The farmhouses are old and made of    
 stone. Insulation has been added to   
 the walls and roof space. The roofs   
 are mainly tiled. Most of the         
 farmhouses have two to three stories. 
                                       
 All of the farmhouses have large sheds
 made from tin. In these they keep     
 tractors, feed for animals and the    
 animals themselves in winter.         
                                       
 Most houses are heated with coal and  
 have central heating. Some of these   
 houses have been renovated using      
 grants but only a few extensions have 
 been built on.                        
                                       
 The lanes leading to the houses have  
 been either tar-macadamed or concreted
 using grants available from the EEC.
