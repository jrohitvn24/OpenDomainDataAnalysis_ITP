		<content> Our block is primarily in a rural     
 area,which as the land cover          
 illustrates,is grassland and          
 grasing.It is basically a farming     
 community. Most of the amenities are  
 situated in the urban areas.          
 even though we live in a rural area,we
 have a remarkable amount of inudustry 
 situated on or near the main          
 Dungannon-Coalisland Road.Within two  
 km are some highly successful         
 industries,which have devoloped over  
 the last tweny years.                 
      Our industries include           
 :Powerscreen,Powercrusher,Tyrone      
 Crystal,Tyrone Brick and the Co-op.The
 industries provide employment as do   
 the local Hospitals,Schools,Abattoir  
 and shops.Many of our fathers are     
 contractors and employ local people   
 which increases employment in our     
 block.This is a thriving community.   </content>
