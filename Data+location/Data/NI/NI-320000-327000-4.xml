		<content> The Mount is the remains of an ancient
 fortified dwelling and is situated in 
 the townland of Ballymaghery where all
 the ancient roads met.It is shaped    
 like a large overturned bowl          
 surrounded by what must have been a   
 moat.It lies about a mile east of     
 Hilltown village.It overlooks part of 
 the valley of the River Bann.It was   
 used as a fortress.                   
    It is situated on the farm of Pat  
 Keenan.Legend has said that there is a
 cave opening at the mount.This cave is
 supposed to lead to the Goward Dolmen 
 which is about two miles away over the
 Goward hill.                          
    The mount is a favourite haunt of  
 school children during the summer.My  
 class went with one of our past       
 teacher's Mr.Hanna some time ago.
