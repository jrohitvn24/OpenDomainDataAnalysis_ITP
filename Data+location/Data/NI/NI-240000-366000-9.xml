		<title>09ON THE SAME FARM TO-DAY</title>
		<content> The same farm to-day is organised very
 differently.Livestock to-day consists 
 of 20 beef cattle and 1 cow.The horse 
 and cart have gone completely to be   
 replaced by tractor and trailer.      
         Very few of the old farmhouses
 are now lived in as they were.Some    
 have now become farm buildings for    
 storage etc,others have been tossed,  
 while others have been renovated to   
 provide modern comfortable housing for
 the family.                           
         Some potatoes are grown each  
 year but the present{Campbell}children
 depend on a diet very much different  
 to that of their ancestors and from a 
 very different source- the
