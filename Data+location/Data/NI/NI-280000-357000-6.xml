		<content> When five cows are milked they leave, 
 allowing another five to enter.All    
 five stands must be filled so if there
 are only four at the end,one must be  
 kept behind.                          
    The milk goes first of all to glass
 containers holding about five gallons 
 each and from there the milk is piped 
 to a stainless steel tank with a      
 capacity of 300 gallons. It is        
 refrigerated and the milk is gently   
 stirred to obtain quick cooling.It is 
 kept at a low temperature until       
 collected by a{bulk tanker}daily and  
 taken to{Tullygoonigan Co-operative   
{Creamery}near Armagh where it is made 
 into butter,cheese and other milk     
 products.Mr.McClean's herd will supply
 about 120 gallons of milk daily to the
 creamery for which he receives 13p per
 litre in the plentiful and less costly
 summer months.                        </content>
