		<title>06THE HALLS</title>
		<content>  There are two halls in Ballygawley.  
 One is beside the Catholic Church and 
 the other is beside the Presbyterian  
 Church. My granda is the caretaker of 
 St.Ciaran's Hall.It was used for      
 saying Mass in,two years ago when we  
 had nowhere to say Mass. This was     
 when the new church was being built.  
 Now it is used for bingo,bowls,discos 
 and parish meetings.Some times there  
 are Bring and Buy sales in it.The     
 other hall is used for much the same  
 things. There is a shop in St.Ciaran's
 Hall as well as a kitchen where people
 can make a cup of tea. The hall was   
 built in 1963.At Christmas time there 
 is a bazaar for the children.Santa    
 Claus comes and gives the children    
 presents.He rings a bell and the      
 children cheer and welcome him.So all 
 ages of people use the halls.
