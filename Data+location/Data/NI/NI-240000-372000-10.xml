		<content> HOUSING (DEIRDRE MCKAY 2 PAGES)       
 The housing in our Domesday area is of
 a high standard.  The easterly side of
 the block is the most built up as it  
 runs into Omagh. The style of the     
 houses varies. Let us first look at   
 the eastern side.  Rented houses are  
 built by the Council. These are two   
 storey terraced houses  which usually 
 have three bedrooms, a bathroom,      
 kitchen and lounge. Garages are built 
 in rows nearby. This type of house is 
 usually built in large parks. Houses  
 that are owned by the people are often
 pebble-dashed and have a similar      
 layout as council houses. The outside 
 of these private houses usually have a
 large garden in contrast to the       
 council houses.                       
 Out in the country areas and to the   
 west some very old houses are to be   
 found_some over 100 years old.        </content>
