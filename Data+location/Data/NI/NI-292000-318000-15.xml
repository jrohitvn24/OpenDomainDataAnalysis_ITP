		<content> It is considered an omen of an unlucky
 marital future if the wedding car     
 breaks down going to the church."To   
 change the name and not the letter is 
 to change for worse and not for       
 better," _ is a well known saying.This
 means that if the first letter of the 
 bride's surname remains unchanged     
 after marriage,it is unlucky.One      
 should not leave a wake unaccompanied 
 and it is said that it is not right to
 take a short cut across fields after  
 midnight - the spirits are abroad     
 then! Here are some minor signs which 
 are said to foretell different events;
 Right eye itchy,_ tears,left eye      
 laughter.Palm of the right hand,a     
 shake hands,palm of the left hand,    
 money coming.Chin itchy,a visitor,    
 knee itchy,a wake.Bridge of the nose  
 itchy,a surprise coming,point of the  
 nose,a quarrel....only superstitions!!</content>
