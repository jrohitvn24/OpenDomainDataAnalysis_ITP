		<title>05THE M2 MOTORWAY</title>
		<content> THE M2 MOTOR WAY. Further on along the
 Shore Road we come to a large motor   
 way intersection with many fly overs. 
 The M2 runs along the Shore Road. It  
 has been built within the last ten to 
 fifteen years. It has extremly heavy  
 traffic. Everyday all day. It forks   
 off, one to Antrim and the other to   
 Carickfergus.The M2 Motorway was built
 on land reclaimed from the sea.From   
 the M2 on the left one can see across 
 Belfast Lough to County Down and the  
 Belfast shipyards.Often one can see   
 the ships travelling up the lough to  
 Belfast docks.The M2 is one of the    
 widest motorways in Europe.This part  
 of the district is not as attractive  
 as some other places we have looked at
 .The motorway runs alongside some of  
 the city rubbish dumps.
