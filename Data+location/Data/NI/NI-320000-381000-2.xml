		<content>   Our Survey Block - an entirely rural
 landscape is dominated by agriculture.
 The farming community rely mainly on  
 their livestock (either beef or dairy 
 cattle) for their livelihood,although 
 many of the smaller farms could still 
 be classed as mixed farms.            
  For those not involved in agriculture
 the presence of a major route (the    
 Seven Mile Straight) running through  
 our area,makes access to towns like   
 Antrim and Ballymena,and the city of  
 Belfast fairly easy.                  
  Lying just outside our area is N.    
 Ireland's only International Airport -
 Aldergrove.The flight paths of many   
 aeroplanes are directly over our      
 school throughout the day.            
  For our study we have chosen what we 
 think is important_our school,our     
 farming community and some interesting
 and unique historical features.       </content>
