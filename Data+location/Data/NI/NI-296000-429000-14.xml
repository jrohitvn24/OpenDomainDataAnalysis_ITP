		<title>14EMPLOYMENT PATTERNS,DERVOCK.</title>
		<content> Unemployment is very high at present  
 and local people hope that Government 
 may be able to bring it down. Worst   
 hit are the school leavers who have   
 nothing to do and no way to pass their
 time. The{Youth Training Scheme}is a  
 good idea but when the year is over   
 there are still very few jobs. There  
 are about 250 adults in our block and 
 about 60 % are unemployed. The rest   
 work in factories or offices in       
 Ballymoney or Coleraine, since there  
 are only about 20 jobs in the village 
 and a few labouring jobs on local     
 farms. All the local farms are owner- 
 occupied, and worked mainly by the    
 owner and his family. There are 5     
 teaching jobs in the school plus the  
 caretaker and 3 kitchen staff. The    
 potato depot employs 8_the rest are in
 shops, pubs, and the inn. The{Ulster  
{Defence Regiment}employs 15 part-time.</content>
