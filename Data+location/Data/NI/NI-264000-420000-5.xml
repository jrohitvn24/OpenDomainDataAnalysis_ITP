   About 9.5 square kilometers of our  
area is used for farmland. There are   
about 15 large farms with extensive    
outbuildings eg silos, barns, cattle   
sheds, milking parlours and piggeries. 
Each farm has its own machinery eg     
tractors, manure spreaders, ploughs,   
rotavators and harvesters.             
   The farm houses are scattered       
throughout the area and act as a focal 
point for the compact farms. There is  
much evidence of hedge removal to      
increase field size. Many of the farms 
are over 60 hectares.                  
   90% of the land is used for farming.
10% is woodland and rough pasture.There
are two woods, Mulkeeragh Wood ( 10    
hectacres ) and Deer Park Wood ( 45    
hectacres ). The trees are mainly      
deciduous, oak and ash.
