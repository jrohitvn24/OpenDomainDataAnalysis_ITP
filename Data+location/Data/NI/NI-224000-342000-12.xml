		<content>   In our area we find several         
 government departments. On the Tempo  
 Road there is the fire station where  
 three engines are kept. It is the main
 station for all the county. The  main 
 customs &amp; excise is out the Dublin Rd.
 It is very important because of our   
 location with the Republic of Ireland 
 &amp; all lorries etc must have permits to
 take goods across the border.         
   Also on Dublin Rd, we have the      
 Fermanagh office for the Western      
 Education &amp; Library Board (WELB). This
 organisation is responsible for all   
 schools &amp; libraries in our county. The
 WELB bus depot &amp; maintenance centre is
 at the back of the Fairview.          
   The District Council is building a  
 new theatre at Ardhowen, the first in 
 Enniskillen. The DOE vehicle testing  
 centre is located at Chanterhill Rd.
