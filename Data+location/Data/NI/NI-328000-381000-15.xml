		<title>15GLENGORMLEY IMPRESSIONS.</title>
		<content>  Glengormley is not too bad but I     
 think that there should be more things
 to do in it. There is not enough      
 playareas like Adventure Playgrounds  
 and also there should be Cinemas to go
 to instead of just getting out Videos,
 because not everybody has got Videos. 
  The things that I like in Glengormley
 are that there is hardly any violence.
 I think that there should be more     
 things to go to like more leisure     
 centres and there should be more big  
 and small shops. I also think that    
 there should be more jobs and things  
 going for younger people because when 
 we get older there will be no jobs    
 left.                                 
  Glengormley is very small and it is  
 not very dirty.                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
