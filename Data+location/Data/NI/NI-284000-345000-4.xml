 .The foundation stone of St Patricks  
 R.C. Cathedral was laid in 1840. From 
 1847_54 work ceased due to the Famine,
 but by 1875 the building was finished.

 Cathedral interior was decorated. In  
 1982_83 the entire sanctuary was      
 redesigned and the original High Altar
 was replaced by a new granite design  
 by Mc Cormick. The Church of Ireland  
 Cathedral stands on{one of the most   
{ancient sites in the British Isles.

 destroyed and rebuilt on at least 17  
 occasions. Inside the Cathedral is a  
 granite slab commerating the burial of
