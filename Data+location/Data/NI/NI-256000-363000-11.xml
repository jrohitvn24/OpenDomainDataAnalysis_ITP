		<title>11A CATHOLIC COMMUNITY</title>
		<content> Most of the population here in our    
 area are Catholic and religion plays a
 big part in their lives. On a Sunday  
 morning everybody except the very sick
 goes to Mass. Afterwards they wait    
 outside the church to chat. Sunday is 
 a day for being dressed, and resting  
 and enjoying sport or visiting        
 friends. Some people go to Mass daily 
 in Sixmilecross.                      
   The Catholic religion is practised  
 in the home as well. There is also    
 reminders in the home like sacred     
 heart pictures and crucfixes,the crib 
 at Christmas,the Lady altar in May and
 the lighted candle in times of joy    
 and sadness.Not long ago in our parish
 a new church was built, and was paid  
 for in a short time. Our priests say  
 that we are very generous. We know our
 priests well and they visit our homes 
 especially when someone is sick.      </content>
