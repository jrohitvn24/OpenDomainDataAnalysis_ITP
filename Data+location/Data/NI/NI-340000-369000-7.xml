		<title>07WORKERS' DAY AT MILLBRIDGE.</title>
		<content>                                       
                                       
 The workers at the school are very    
 busy each day. They start work at 7.3O
 a.m. checking that all the horses are 
 safe and well after the night. They   
 feed them at 8.3O a.m., and then 'muck
 out' the stables and groom the horses 
 until the horses are next fed at I2.3O
 p.m. The afternoon would be spent     
 exercising the horses over the        
 surrounding hills or along the country
 roads, followed by another grooming.  
                                       
 The horses are fed again at IO.OO     
 p.m.This is a normal days work. The   
 routine changes on a Friday, when     
 there are no rides, and when the      
 workers prepare and plan the next     
 day's riding lessons; on Saturday     
 itself; and on the days when the      
 handicapped come for their lessons.   </content>
