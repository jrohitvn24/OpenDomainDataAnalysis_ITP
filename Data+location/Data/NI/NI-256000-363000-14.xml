		<title>14ALTAMUSKIN PRIMARY SCHOOL</title>
		<content> Altamuskin National School was built  
 in 1906 to replace the old schoolhouse
 nearby. In 1964 it was extended and   
 renamed St. Brigid's Primary, the     
 original building now becoming a      
 dining/assembly hall. Since 1977 when 
 Cloghfin School closed and merged with
 Altamuskin, the numbers enrolled have 
 gradually increased to the present    
 105, two thirds of whom travel by bus.
    Lessons begin at 9.05am and end at 
 3.20pm. There is a dinner break of 45 
 minutes when dinners cooked in the    
 school-kitchen are served to about 90 
 pupils. The 4 teachers and 2 cooks    
 travel by car. Apart from teaching the
 teachers take charge of us at meals   
 and breaks. The girls make coffee for 
 the teachers.This is a Catholic school
 and all the children in this area are 
 Catholics. The teacher showed us      
 records of this school back to 1870.  </content>
