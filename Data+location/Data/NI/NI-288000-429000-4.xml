		<title>04LIFE ON THE FARM.</title>
		<content>  In my part of the country near       
 Damhead Primary School most of the    
 farmers have mixed farms.This means   
 they work with animals as well as     
 planting and sowing crops.Their cows  
 are milked two times every day.       
  In springtime they sow barley.This   
 barley is used in winter to feed the  
 animals.In the summer the farmers are 
 busy making silage and hay which is   
 also used as fodder.                  
  When it comes to autumn their  crops 
 are ready to be harvested.In winter   
 the animals are kept in houses around 
 the farmyard and the farmer feeds them
 two times every day.                  
  The farmer is very busy all year     
 round.                                
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
