		<title>05LOCAL FARMING</title>
		<content>   In our area the commonest farm      
 animals are cattle.On two farms       
 Friesians are kept for milking.Most   
 are beef cattle which are cross breeds
 of Simmental,Charolais and Hereford.  
 Most of the cattle are stores because 
 winter feed is very expensive.        
    Everyone used to have a few hens   
 but now we buy our eggs from shops or 
 large producers.There is one of these 
 producers in 0262.                    
     One farmer in 0261 rears sheep.   
 They are mainly Suffolk and Border    
 Leicester.                            
     Average lambing rate is two per   
 ewe.The average weight of fleece is   
 2Kg.Lambs are sold for meat from June 
 to July.Ewes are sold for meat.       
 Replacement ewes are bought in summer.
