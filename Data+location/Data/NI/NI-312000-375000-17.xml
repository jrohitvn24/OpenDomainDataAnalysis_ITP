		<title>17MY HOUSE ( IN THE COUNTRY )</title>
		<content> My house is on a country road and is  
 about one hundred years old .During   
 the second world war we think our     
 house may have been used by American  
 soilders who were stationed here.Last 
 summer an American and his wife who   
 were visiting Northern Ireland for the
 first time since the war came to our  
 house and took photographs to take    
 back to America as he was sure that   
 this was the house he had stayed      
 in.The house was not always the size  
 it is now, over the years there have  
 been extensions made to it.At the     
 moment the house is one thousand five 
 hundred square feet ,and has a front  
 porch a hall a living room,a dining   
 room , a kitchen , a study , a        
 bathroom and four bedrooms. We also   
 have a conservetory and a large back  
 garden with a lot of fruit trees in   
 it.                                   </content>
