		<content> Newry Gas works opened in 1857 and has
 since supplied the town.In recent     
 years the town has expanded beyond the
 existing supply lines,leaving many new
 houses without gas.The company has    
 been running at a loss.The debt in    
 1985 is Â£230,000 and the government   
 subsidies,which have kept the Gas     
 works going for some years,are now    
 withdrawn from May 5th.The council    
 cannot afford to keep the Gas works   
 open.                                 
    Five years ago it was proposed to  
 bring natural gas from Kinsale,Co.Cork
 to Newry and Belfast.But gas and oil  
 is priced in US dollars and the pound 
 rapidly lost value against the dollar.
 As a result the cost of Kinsale gas it
 would no longer be economically       
 viable.
