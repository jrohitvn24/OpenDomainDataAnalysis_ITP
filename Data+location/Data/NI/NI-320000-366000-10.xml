		<content>{BROOKHILL HOUSE}-Ballinderry Rd.      
 Today a farmhouse stands on land which
 at the start of the 17th.C.was an     
 estate of Sir Foulk Conway who was    
 then a very powerful landowner.       
  In the 1641 Rebellion the original   
 house was burnt to the ground by the  
 forces of Phelim O'Neill and Con      
 Magennis.It was rebuilt and enlarged  
 in 1649 by George Rawdon,Conway's     
 agent.                                
  In 1740 when the estate belonged to  
 James Watson,lime was used here as    
 fertilizer for the first time in      
 Ireland.This was to lead to the       
 establishment of many local limestone 
 quarries.                             
  From 1850 the estate was sold several
 times until the present owners,Boomers
 ,bought it in the 1950s.In 1960 the   
 300 year old house,being in a         
 dangerous condition was demolised.    </content>
