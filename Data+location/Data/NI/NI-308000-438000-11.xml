		<content>{Hurling}in Ballycastle is long        
 established in the families of the    
 town. The hurling club was set up in  
 1907 and since has become famous not  
 just in the area but in the whole of  
 Ireland. There are many well known    
 players but many others of equal      
 quality have worn the{black}and{amber}
 colours.                              
 Matches are played every Sunday. At   
 home matches the attendance is around 
 200 people. At important matches an   
 enormous crowd gathers.               
 The most important tournament is the{ 
{Championship}in which all the teams in
 Antrim take part. The winner of this  
 goes forward to the{Ulster}and{       
{All_Ireland}Championship, the ultimate
 target for a club. Ballycastle has won
 a record 16 Antrim titles and has been
 in the All_Ireland final once.
