		<content> I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE      
 SPORTS OF MY AREA.  THE MAIN SPORTS   
 ARE HURLEY AND CAMOGIE.  I AM VERY    
 INVOLVED AS MY ENTIRE FAMILY PLAY.  MY
 FATHER, MY BROTHER, MYSELF, MY COUSINS
 AND AND UNCLES ALL PLAY FOR ONE       
 TEAM,BALLYGALGET MITCHELS.  RECENTLY  
 THE UNDER 14'S HAVE BEEN VERY         
 SUCCESSFUL AGAINST OLD RIVAL TEAM,    
 "BALLYCRAN" IN THE FEILE NA NGAEL     
 TOURNAMENT IN WHICH ANY TEAM CAN ENTER
 CONSIDERING AGE GROUPS. THE TEAM HAVE 
 WON A TRIP TO WEXFORD, IN WHICH THEY  
 HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN ANOTHER          
 CHAMPIONSHIP. THIS WOULD ENCOURAGE    
 MANY MORE CHILDERN TO JOIN A CLUB AND 
 JOIN IN SPORT ACTIVITIES.  ALSO       
 BALLYGALGET HAVE DONE WELL IN CAMOGIE 
 AS THEY ARE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
