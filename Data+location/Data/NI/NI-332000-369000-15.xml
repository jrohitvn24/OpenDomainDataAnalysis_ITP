		<content>    Entertainment questionnaires were  
 devised and distributed throughout the
 area. Most of the replies came from   
 elderly people who rarely attended    
 plays,concerts or pantomimes. The     
 overall consensus of opinon was that  
 the entertainment facilities provided 
 were at best only satisfactory.       
 Variety was limited with there being  
 only 1 small theatre and 1 cinema     
 serving the whole area. Most people   
 questioned preferred to watch T.V._   
 their favourite programmes being the  
 News and Sports.                      
  { As a result of a questionnaire     
{carried out in local sports shops we  
{found out that a) 300 people (av.) use
{the shops each day                    
               {b) Racquet Sports are  
{the most popular }                    
               {c) Sporting activities 
{are on the increase.(Stranmillis P.S.)</content>
