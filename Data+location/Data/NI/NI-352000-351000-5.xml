		<content> The James Morrow Company are also     
 involved in the repair of Yachts and  
 boats which are naturally widely used 
 in the area because of the interest in
 sailing on Strangford Lough.  Outline 
 planning has been obtained for a      
 Marina development.  The horse-shoe   
 shaped bay and harbour will be        
 dredged, initially to accomodate 300  
 boats and eventually it is hoped, some
 600 yachts will be able to use the    
 Marina.  The plan includes the        
 building of Chalets, changing         
 facilities, restaurants and car       
 parking space.  Not only will the     
 Yacht owners be able to sail into     
 Strangford Lough but with the new     
 Harbour Airport at Belfast, the       
 International airport and the small   
 airfield at Newtownards the Marina    
 will be easily accessible for         
 Yachtsmen.                            </content>
