		<content>     The landscape in this block owes  
 much to the work of ice during the    
 last ice-age.The two hills which form 
 the town are drumlins as are the hills
 which surround the town.On these hills
 have been built the forts of the past 
 and the housing estates of today      
 both public and private e.g.Windmill, 
 Cornagrade,Old Rossorry and Drumlin   
 Heights.These hilly areas give good   
 views of the town,but they have       
 drawbacks particularly for{FARMING.  }
     The many lakes e.g.Lough Galliagh,
 Rossole Lough are nearly cut off from 
 the River Erne. The drumlins and the  
 lakes impede{Transport}and have       
 contributed to the "scattered" aspect 
 of the town.In the rural area the     
 drumlins provide good grassland but in
 the hollows between them drainage is  
 poor and the land of little value     
 except for rough grazing.             </content>
