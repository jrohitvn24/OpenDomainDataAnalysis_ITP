		<content> In  Kilbride  Presbyterian  {graveyard
 there  are  some  interesting features
 of  which  one  is  a  mud  hut  where
 bodies were left  to  disintegrate  so
 they   would  be   no   use   to   the
 graverobbers .  There   is  a  {mosque
 where  bodies  were  on view on tiered
 shelves. There is the grave of William
 Gault  who   started  the first{Sunday
{School}in Ireland  in  the  eighteenth
 century.  This  was  not only a school
 for {religious  education }but   where
 children were taught to read and write
 on a Sunday.This was the only  day  of
 the   week   when  they    had    this
 opportunity as  during  the  week they
 were required  to  work  in the fields
 and mills from an early age.
