		<title>17LISSANOURE CASTLE</title>
		<content> In this area there are the ruins of   
{Lissanoure Castle.}This building was  
 started in 1770 by{Lord Macartney}who 
 was British Ambassador to China. It   
 was completed in 1829 by{George Hume  
{Macartney.}It was a strange structure 
 in that it had windows only in the    
 front. The other three sides had      
 battlements.                          
 Some barrels of{gunpowder}had been    
 stored in the Castle from 1790, and it
 is thought some of it had spilled. At 
 noon on{October 5th, 1847}the powder  
 exploded(it is believed sparks or a   
 flame touched it), and the Castle was 
 demolished.{Mrs George Hume Macartney 
 died in the blast.                    
 Long before, on the same site there   
 stood the{old Castle}which was built  
 by{Sir Philip Savage}in the year{1200.
