		<title>15MARKET DAY IN ENNISKILLEN</title>
		<content>    When{CAPTAIN COLE}first established
{the town}in the 17th century he had to
 establish a market.The day chosen was 
 Thursday and this is still"mart"day.  
 Although the market is outside the    
 block the whole town reaps the benefit
 of the mart.Local farmers,and some    
 from further away,converge on the town
 in large numbers on Thursday morning, 
 to buy and sell cattle. This causes   
 traffic jams at the West Bridges and  
 Belmore Street.The{trade}of the shops 
 increase and most have a busy day.The 
 shops at the{DIAMOND}where the main   
 ones are found,have a busy time. The  
 town remains busy all day and when 5  
 p.m.comes the traffic jams restart as 
 most people make their way home.      
 Generally,apart from Saturday,Thursday
 is the busiest day of the week.The    
 numbers are swollen on many Thursdays 
 by shoppers from the REPUBLIC.        </content>
