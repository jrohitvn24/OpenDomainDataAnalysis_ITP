		<content> There are two schools in Hilltown One 
 is Catholic and the other is the State
 or Protestant school. After seven     
 years at Primary school we go to      
 Secondary school in Warrenpoint or    
 Grammar school in Newry, depending on 
 whether we passed the qualifying      
 examination.The Catholic Grammar      
 schools for girls are Our Lady's or   
 the Sacred Heart The boys Grammar     
 schools are the Abbey and St          
 Colman's.After Primary school the     
 Protestants go to Newry or Rathfriland
 High School.They take boys and        
 girls,and Newry High takes Catholics  
 as well. I asked some people in my    
 class who are going to Our Lady's     
 whether they would rather have a mixed
 SCHOOL or would they prefer it to be  
 all                                   
 girls.They said that they prefer it   
 the way it is,all girls.              </content>
