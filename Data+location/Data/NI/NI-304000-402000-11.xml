		<title>11LIFE IN GALGORM</title>
		<content>  People in Galgorm maybe self employed
 or employed by large companies such as
 Gallahers. Farmers have their own     
 business in which they sell goods like
 potatoes and eggs and also breed      
 cattle to sell their produce.There is 
 a garden centre in Galgorm from which 
 people in the area can buy plants and 
 small trees such as fir trees and     
 cherry blossom.                       
  Life in Galgorm can be intewresting  
 even for the unemployed,there are     
 summer schemes in which they can work 
 and in the evenings there are band    
 parades.People enjoy themselves in    
 their own gardens growing vegetables  
 and flowers.Life for older generation 
 can become dull,they do not have as   
 much energy as the young and cannot   
 join in the summer activities.Some    
 people invent their own games to pass 
 the time,like rounders and badminton. </content>
