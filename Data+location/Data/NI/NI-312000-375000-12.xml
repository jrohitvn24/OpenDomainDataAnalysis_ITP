		<title>12CRUMLIN'S DOUBLE BRIDGE</title>
		<content>    There is a bridge in Crumlin and it
 is the only known one of its kind in  
 the British Isles.The bridge is a     
 railway bridge over a road bridge over
 a river.The river is called the Camlin
 River.The river runs through Crumlin  
 Glen into Lough Neagh.The road bridge 
 has four arches. Most of the year only
 three arches are used by the river but
 after a heavy shower all four arches  
 fill  with water.                     
    The railway line runs past the back
 of our school and then on over the    
 railway bridge. The line becomes      
 single track at this section. The     
 metal railway bridge is built in a    
 cris-cross pattern and was finished in
 1915.                                 
    I cross the road section of this   
 bridge every day and until now did not
 realise how important it really was.
