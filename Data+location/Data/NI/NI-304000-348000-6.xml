		<content> Two bus services pass through Gilford.
 One is the Ulsterbus with a service   
 between Banbridge and Portadown and   
 the other is Sureline between Lurgan  
 and Tandragee. Each weekday an average
 of 32 go to Portadown and Banbridge   
 while 4 buses travel to Lurgan and    
 Tandragee. With the ever increasing   
 number of private cars on the road    
 workers usually share lifts to and    
 from work. Until the early 1950's a   
 railway station at the Madden on the  
 Tandragee Road served the needs of    
 Gilford. The station is now closed on 
 this Dublin to Belfast railway. The   
 railway station in Scarva has         
 re-opened for a few trains during the 
 day. The Newry Canal, opened in 1737, 
 has been closed to traffic since the  
 beginning of World War II in 1939.    
 Efforts are being made to re-open it  
 for pleasure purposes.                </content>
