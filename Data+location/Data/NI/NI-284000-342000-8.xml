		<content> She  gets her breakfast and dinner    
 all in one.After she has eaten this   
 meal,  she  goes to her grandmothers  
 and  does outdoor work and also       
 some indoor work.                     
 She would do all this because her     
 grandmother is not fit enough to do it
 all by herself.She then goes home     
 for her tea.After tea she cleans the  
 kitchen and does the hoovering then   
 she gets ready for the band parade.   
 She lives is in Ballyrea and her      
 hobbies are going to band parades and 
 practices.                            
      When she goes out she  enjoys    
 herself very much.After she does      
 her work sometimes she goes for a     
 walk down to the Navan Fort and back  
 again.Beatrice goes to bed at 12.00.
