		<content> The River Bann is a very large        
 river.It flows from the Deers Meadow  
 through Lough Neigh to the Atlantic   
 Ocean.It runs in under the 8 mile     
 bridge in Hilltown.There is a         
 whirlpool further on down the         
 river.A man has said to be drowned    
 very near there one time              
    Many people use the river for      
 fishing and swimming although there   
 are not many fish round the 8 mile    
 bridge but there are salmon and other 
 kinds of fish near the waterfall.All  
 of the water runs into Spelga Dam but 
 only some of it is cleaned so that we 
 can wash ourselves and drink it.      
    There is a road that goes on past  
 the river and it is called the Bann   
 Loanen.In the summer you can go on    
 walks with the youth club.Also in the 
 summer you can go down to the river   
 and have a picnic.  BY ELAINE McGREEVY</content>
