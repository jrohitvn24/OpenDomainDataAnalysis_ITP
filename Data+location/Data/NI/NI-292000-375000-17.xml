		<title>17TRANSPORT IN ARDBOE</title>
		<content> Nearly every family in Ardboe has a   
 car nowadays.There were never any     
 railways near the area and public     
 transport is provided by the bus      
 service.There are daily services  to  
 the nearest towns,Magherafelt and     
 Cookstown.Long ago most of this       
 movement was done by horses and the   
 heavier loads were moved by barge and 
 lighter into and out of the local     
 harbour at the Battery.A reminder of  
 those days is in the still used       
 expression of "going for a sail" even 
 if the person really means going for  
 a trip by road.The old air field is   
 very useful for those learning        
 to drive if they keep clear of the    
 potholes.Children nearly all travel   
 to school by bus,even to the local    
 primary schools and know as little of 
 the real country life as would        
 children always living in towns       </content>
