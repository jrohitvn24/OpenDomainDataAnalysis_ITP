 blessed and then my Grandad was       
 buried. Afterwards everyone went back 
 to the house where a meal was provided
 for the relatives and close friends. I
 was surprised the a funeral could be  
 such a mixture of sadness and         
 celebration,but then if Grandad had   
 gone to Heaven then I suppose it was  
 cause for celebration.                
{As a result of my Grandad's death I   
{learnt a lot about funerals and the   
{customs which are followed in         
{Ireland.Funerals have always been very
{important in Ireland and provide an   
{opportunity for people to get         
{together. Traditionally a wake is held
{for the deceased who is not buried    
{until the third day after dying. This 
{might have something to do with making
{sure that the person was really dead.
