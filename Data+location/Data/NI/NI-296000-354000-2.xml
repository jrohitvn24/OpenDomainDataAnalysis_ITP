		<title>02A TOUR OF OUR AREA</title>
		<content>   We travel along the steadily rising 
 road out of Portadown to the Garvaghy 
 roundabout (the "entrance" to our     
 survey area) and the surroundings seem
 to change suddenly from city to       
 countryside. It is almost like going  
 into a different world,though from the
 hills of this{drumlin}area we have    
 many fine views of Portadown lying    
 below.                                
   We are in lush green{"Basket of     
{eggs"}countryside given almost        
 completely to{farming}.There are many 
 large farmhouses with their           
 outbuildings as well as cottage-type  
 dwellings. In more recent years many  
 townspeople are choosing to build     
 attractive modern bungalows in this   
 quiet region.                         
   There are two main roads,one to Moy 
 and the other to the Motorway and the 
 North and West of the Province.       </content>
