		<title>19FISHING IN THE RIVER BUSH</title>
		<content>  My name is Geoffrey McCook and I     
 enjoy fishing. One of the best types  
 of fishing is fly fishing because you 
 can fish with ease and try all the    
 tricks and probably catch more        
 fish.The best baits to use for trout  
 are a fly and a worm and sometimes    
 bread.A man called Robert Smith is a  
 very good fisherman living by the     
 river and he fishes every day         
 and  he makes his own fishing tackle. 
  There are fish in the river that are 
 so clever you can't catch them.There  
 are plenty of fisherman in Armoy who  
 catch trout .The salmon in our river  
 can grow over 6Kg in weight and you   
 would need an adult to bring them in  
 for you.I have cought 23 trout this   
 season and one small salmon but I let 
 him go back into the river.           
  I enjoy fishing in the river because 
 it is so clean and peaceful there.    </content>
