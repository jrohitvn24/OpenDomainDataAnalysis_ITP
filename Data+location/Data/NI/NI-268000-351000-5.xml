		<title>05Beef farming</title>
		<content>   In the area we studied many farmers 
 keep beef cattle,  which are reared to
 provide meat for human consumption.   
 Examples include steaks, roasts and   
 mince.                                
  {The main beef breeds are Limousins, 
{Herefords, Simmentals, Aberdeen Angus 
{and Charolois.                        
   In winter time beef cattle are fed  
 on silage, hay or concentrates (meal  
 and salt licks).  This helps to keep  
 them healthy and in good condition.   
 In summer they graze on grassland.    
   Beef cattle are kept in pens in     
 slatted houses with a feeding passage 
 up the centre.  Under the houses there
 are slurry tanks to hold the manure.  
   Some farmers pellet their beef      
 cattle with growth hormones in order  
 to increase profits _ the hormone is  
 implanted, as a pellet, behind the    
 animal's ear and helps him thrive.    </content>
