		<content>                                       
 I live in Ballybeen Estate and I like 
 it very much. There are plenty of     
 fields to play in because it is in the
 country although more and more houses 
 are being built and soon there will   
 not be many fields about.             
 Most of my friends live in Ballybeen  
 so I am never lonely and we only take 
 5 minutes to walk across to school in 
 the mornings. The shops are in the    
 centre of the estate and are          
 convenient for everyone.              
 Although I like living in the estate I
 think there are far too many houses in
 it. Ballybeen is the second biggest   
 estate in N.I. and it must have the   
 worst youth facilities. There is      
 nothing at all for young people to do.
