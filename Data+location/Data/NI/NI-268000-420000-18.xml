		<title>18TRAINING A SHEEPDOG</title>
		<content> Training a sheepdog is easier with    
 some dogs than others.  First you get 
 about 10 sheep and take the dog on a  
 lead to the field.  You get the sheep 
 into the corner and you let the dog   
 try and keep them there.  A good dog  
 should go very wide around them, but  
 some dogs go very tight.  Next you    
 make him lie down, and you go between 
 the dog and the sheep.  You give him  
 the command to go left, but he doesn't
 know it.  If he goes to the right you 
 stop him and make him go left.  You do
 this several times until he learns how
 to do it.  It is the same idea for    
 going right.  Now he must learn to lie
 down immediately he is told.  With    
 practice he will be ready for driving.
 The commands are "Come by" (left),    
 "Way to me" (right), "Lay down" (sit),
 "Get up" (walk on), "That all do"     
 (finish work). WRITTEN BY GRAHAM, 11. </content>
