		<content>  In Irvinestown there is a branch of  
 the Lisburn Hide Company. It was      
 established here because there were   
 large numbers of animals being killed 
 at the abattoirs in Enniskillen and   
 Omagh. They also get some hides from  
 Clones. This was a central area for   
 the two regions and a premises was    
 already available _ the old brickworks
 which was altered slightly. The hides 
 are graded,cleaned and covered with   
 salt which helps to preserve them     
 and dries the moisture out of them.   
 The salt comes in from Spain. About 20
 to 30 tonnes is needed each week. Here
 in Irvinestown they deal with the     
 hides of cattle and sheep. They deal  
 with 1,000 hides per week. Most of    
 them are then sent to the parent      
 company in Lisburn. From there they   
 go to Italy to be made into leather   
 goods - belts, shoes, bags.           </content>
