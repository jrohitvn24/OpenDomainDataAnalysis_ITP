		<title>09WEDDING DAY IN COALISLAND.</title>
		<content> My name is{Peter Donnelly}and my      
 brother was married last year in {    
{KEADY.}It is customary to get married 
 in the bride's church.Everyone was    
 very nervous so we arrived at the     
 church 20 minutes before the time.    
 Photos were taken before we went in.  
 The bride,bridesmaids and flowergirls 
 arrived on time despite the custom of 
 the bride arriving late.Yhe wedding   
 service takes place during{MASS}and   
 the whole service lasted about an     
 hour.There were lots of photos        
 afterwards.The best part was the meal 
 in{The Chestnut  Lodge,Benburb.I had  
 as much as I wanted to eat:           
 soup,turkey,ham,potatoes,vegetables,  
 trifle,ice-cream and last of all,     
 wedding cake. There were lots of      
 boring speeches and then there was    
 dancing and drinking. I think I had a 
 better day than my brother.           </content>
