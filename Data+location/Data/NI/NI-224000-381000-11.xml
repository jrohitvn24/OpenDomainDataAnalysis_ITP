 There was great laughter, which       
 continued as long as we were hearing; 
 for in an Irish fair there is as much 
 good humour in the morning as there is
 quarrelling at night."                
   "We walked up the rugged hill that  
 leads to Castle Gore. Though, not many
 years ago, the seat of grandeur and   
 magnificence, Castle Gore is now      
 almost as absolute a picture of       
 desolation as I ever beheld.  Yet it  
 is interesting even in decay;         
 elevatednon a high hill, it is seen in
 every direction, and the antique      
 avenue of old trees has further effect
 of beauty, in this land of mountains  
 and floods."
