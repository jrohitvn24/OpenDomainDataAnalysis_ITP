		<content> slurry which is an animal produced    
 fertiliser. Some farmers (but very    
 few) keep chickens for their eggs.    
 When the chickens are finished laying 
 they are used for food.               
 In March or April farmers sow a       
 variety of crops. These include wheat,
 barley or potatoes. In August the     
 farmer uses the combine harvester to  
 cut the barley. The barley is made    
 into beer or animal food.             
 The important machines which are used 
 on a farm are tractor, combine        
 harvester, slurry spreader, seed      
 drill, plough, harrow, mowing machine,
 turner, baler and grass blower.       
 In many parts of our block there is   
 bogland.These areas are too small for 
 commercial use.Instead the farmer cuts
 turf from them.This is used as a fuel 
 on his own fire during the winter.
