 activities like football,dancing,     
 drinking and concerts.Trillick is a   
 small village with a population of    
 about four hundred.                   
     On Sunday people come to church.  
 There are three churches in the       
 village.The oldest church is the      
 "Church of Ireland" at the top of the 
 village.In the middle of the village  
 there is the most modern church       
 "Sacred Heart Oratory".Beside it there
 is the "Methodist Church".
