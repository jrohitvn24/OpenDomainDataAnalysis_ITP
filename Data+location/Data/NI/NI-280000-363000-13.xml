		<content> The site provided for the training was
 in the yard of a local hotel,{McAleers
 which also carried on the business of 
 funeral undertakers.The young trainees
 sometimes glanced furtively over their
 shoulders to see a stack of coffins   
 occupying a corner of the shed near   
 their cutting machines.This experience
 does not seem to have affected them   
 however,because most of those early   
 recruits are now first class craftmen.
   In 1971 the first phase of the      
 new factory was completed.There is    
 great significance in the date because
 in 1771,just 200 yrs. earlier Benjamin
 Edwards from Bristol opened a crystal 
 glassworks at Drumreagh 3 mls from the
 Tyrone Crystal factory.The Drumreagh  
 works had been transferred to Belfast 
 after a few years but it is           
 interesting to note that a 2 centuries
 old tradition had been revived.       </content>
