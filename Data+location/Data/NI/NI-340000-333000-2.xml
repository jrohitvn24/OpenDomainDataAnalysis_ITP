		<title>02Old dunes;Murlough</title>
		<content> The area consists of shingle ridges   
 overlain by sand dunes. The shingle   
 ridges are fossil storm beach ridges  
 and the dunes seem to be of two main  
 phases. The older lower (20m high)    
 landward dunes are the more stable,   
 with some having been reclaimed as    
 farmland. These older dunes support an
 acid heathland vegetation including   
 Heathers, Burnet Rose, Marram Grass,  
 Bramble, Gorse, various Bents, Lady's 
 Bedstraw, Violas, Sedges, Cladonia    
 spp. and various Mosses. The scrub and
 woodland areas include pines,         
 deciduous species such as sycamore and
 elder. Sea Buckthorn was introduced   
 and has become a nuisance but recent  
 clearing has been successful in small 
 areas. The Buckthorn is however the   
 most important habitat for Winter     
 birds, providing shelter, a rich crop 
 of orange berries and many insects.   </content>
