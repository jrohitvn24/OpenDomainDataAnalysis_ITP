		<title>09SCHOOL LIFE TODAY</title>
		<content> Today most children start school at{4 
{years old}but when Granny was a little
 girl she went to school at{the age of 
{6.}Most of the children then walked to
 school in their{bare feet}because     
 their parents had not enough money to 
 buy them shoes. Today we have         
{cars,buses,taxies}or{bicycles}to take 
 us.When Granny was going to school the
 children were taught{English,Irish,   
{Reading,Writing,Mathematics,History,  
{Geography,Sewing &amp; Cookery,}similar to
 todays subjects. Nowadays at the end  
 of the Primary School career there is 
 an examination called{the Eleven Plus.
 As a result of the grades obtained in 
 this test a pupil is selected for an  
 academic education in a {Grammar      
{School}or for a more practical        
 education at a {High School.
