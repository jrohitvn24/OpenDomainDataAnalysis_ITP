		<title>07      Dairy farm ctd</title>
		<content> Quite alot of money is involved in a  
 dairy farm.The 44 cows cost about{Â£500
 each, that is Â£22,000 to begin with.  
 The farm might be worth Â£50 000       
 depending on size and then much       
 equipment is needed. So you see, the  
 farmer needs to be well paid for his  
 work.Cows sometimes become ill and the
{chief illnesses}are{mastitis,and      
{tetany.}The cows are also tested for  
{tuberculosis}and{brucellosis}and      
 infected animals must be disposed of. 
 Before the cows leave the milking     
 parlour their teats are dipped in     
 disinfectant to stop mastitis.        
    Work on a dairy farm is arduous,   
 continuous work but an interesting and
 rewarding life nevertheless. We,the   
 general public,should be very grateful
 to those who devote their lives to the
 production of one of the best foods we
 can have.                             </content>
