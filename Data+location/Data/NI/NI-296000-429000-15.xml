		<title>15CHURCHES &amp; WORSHIP, DERVOCK.</title>
		<content> There are 3 places of worship in our  
 block_{Dervock}and{Roseyards          
{Presbyterian Churches}and the{Roman   
{Catholic Chapel of Our Lady and St.   
{John's.}Each is over 150 years        
 old, and built of stone. Most people  
 in the district belong to{Derrykeighan
{Parish Church,}which is just outside  
 our block. There are over 400 seats in
 each Presbyterian Church, but present 
 attendances are very much below       
 capacity. Services are held each      
 Sunday morning, and quite often on    
 evenings for special occasions. Both  
 have Sunday Schools and there are 4   
 local independent Sunday Schools. The 
 Orange Hall has monthly Sunday evening
 services and a mission for 2 weeks    
 each year. Each group holds its own   
 prayer meetings and there are several 
 private prayer groups.
