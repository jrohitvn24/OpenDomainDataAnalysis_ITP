		<title>13New Homes,       Randalstown</title>
		<content> Until recently,the way to get the most
 space for money has been to buy an old
 house and adapt or convert it.But     
 old property of any character is      
 fetching such enormous prices,and     
 builders costs for renovation work are
 so high, that it is now cheaper in    
 most cases to buy a site and build    
 from scratch. Builders always charge  
 relatively more for on old property   
 because there are so many unknown     
 factors involved, against which they  
 need to cover themselves. With new    
 work it is possible to estimate much  
 more precisely.                       
                                       
  There are several new houses situated
 along the Ahoghill Road,most of them  
 on elevated sites. Other houses nearby
 have just been renovated in the last  
 ten years.            (contd.)
