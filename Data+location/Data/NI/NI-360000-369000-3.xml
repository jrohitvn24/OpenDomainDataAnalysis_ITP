		<title>03Farming around Ballywalter</title>
		<content>    In our block there is a lot of     
 grassland with half of the farmers    
 keeping dairy cows and the other half 
 keeping beef cattle.                  
  The dairy farmers cannot keep more   
 than a certain amount of milk in a    
 year.They send their milk to Belfast  
 and other large towns.The farms are   
 about fifty to one hundred acres in   
 size.                                 
   On some of the larger farms they    
 grow winter barley,winter wheat,spring
 barley,spring wheat and oats.         
 Farmers cut silage about May and then 
 cut a second cut in July or August.   
 Sheep are kept by a few farmers while 
 others have pigs and poultry.         
   Pigs and poultry can be kept by     
 farmers who have very little land.
