		<title>13ACTIVITIES IN LEISURE TIME</title>
		<content> Although recreational facilities in   
 this area are limited to one football 
 pitch and one tennis court, people    
 still participate in a wide variety of
 activities.                           
 The most popular outdoor activity we  
 found was gardening which is          
 appropriate in a rural community.     
 Football would be the next most       
 popular outdoor activity.When surveyed
 we found that the people had been     
 following their particular pastime for
 more than five years.Indoors people   
 occuppied themselves by watching      
 tv,knitting,keep fit and in recent    
 years Gymnastics especially amongst   
 the younger generation.               
 Those who had little leisure time were
 from farms or had young children.     
 It was significant that 70% watched TV
 as a major pastime with an average of 
 4-5 hours viewing per day.            </content>
