		<content> The farmland in this block is         
 generally high quality, rolling fields
 with some very large fields around    
 Mount Panther (404386). The farms on  
 this side of the Bay are mainly dairy 
 with some sheep and cereals. This     
 year's cereal crop was very poor due  
 to the bad summer weather. The very   
 large field at 407387 was unusually   
 badly flattened, even for this bad    
 summer. The farmer at Mount Panther   
 also has a small herd of Sika Deer on 
 his farm. The farms on the other      
 (Eastern) side of the Bay tend to have
 smaller fields and more beef cattle   
 than dairy. the land on this side is  
 more dissected by drumlins and wet or 
 marshy inter-drumlin hollows. The     
 roads on this side of the Bay are     
 narrow and twisty with some very bad  
 bends and junctions. The roads on the 
 west side are much better.            </content>
