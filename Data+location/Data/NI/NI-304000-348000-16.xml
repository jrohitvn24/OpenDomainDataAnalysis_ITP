		<content> The Northern Ireland Housing Executive
 is a state body and owns the following
 estates: Woodlands, Connors Row,      
 Dunbarton Bungalows, Hill St, High St,
 Hill Crest Villas, Bann View Terrace, 
 Locard Park and Castleview. Private   
 developments are located at Moyallan  
 Park and Pine View Court. Very few    
 individuals have built their own      
 houses because landowners refused to  
 sell building land. Occupiers of      
 houses in High St bought their houses 
 from the Mill owners and had them     
 renovated. They got grants from the NI
 Housing Executive to do this work. The
 average number of houses in each      
 estate is estimated at 100. The       
 average number of houses in each park 
 is estimated at 10. Most houses have 2
 storeys but there are some houses     
 which have only 1. Houses designated  
 for pensioners are all one storey.    </content>
