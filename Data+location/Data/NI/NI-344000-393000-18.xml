  As long ago as the New Stone Age     
 there was a settlement on Muldersleigh
 Hill. One of the most important       
 developments was the building of the  
 FORD across LARNE LOUGH.{Ballycarry}  
 was derived from{Ballaghkarry}which   
 translated means 'The Town of the     
 Ford'. Today the main settlements are 
 on either side of the ford.           
{WEST_}Ballycarry's housing            
 developments are at both ends of Main 
 Street on which houses are being      
 renovated, aided by restoration       
 grants.                               
{EAST_}The main residential area is at 
 Ballystrudder and around the Rinkha.  
 Planning permission has been granted  
 for further housing development.
