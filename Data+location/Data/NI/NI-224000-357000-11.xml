		<title>11The Creamery (1)</title>
		<content> Our group went down to the creamery   
 where we were met by one of the       
 managers who gave us a guided tour.   
 The building and storage tanks were   
 huge. A lorry came up the drive. It   
 stopped on a large sheet of metal     
 which was an automatic weigh bridge.  
 They already know the exact weight of 
 the empty tanker. When the full tanker
 comes in the weight is recorded - the 
 weight of the empty tanker is         
 subtracted and they then know how much
 milk the tanker is carrying.          
     The tanker is then driven to the  
 dispatch area. Here two tankers can be
 unloaded at the same time. Hose pipes 
 are attached and the milk flows       
 directly from the tanker into two     
 large tanks which can hold up to 500  
 gallons each.The milk is separated    
 into cream and whey. The cream is made
 into butter automatically,by machine. </content>
