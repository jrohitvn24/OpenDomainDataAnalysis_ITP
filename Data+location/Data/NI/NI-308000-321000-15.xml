		<content> In the area there is a marked lack of 
 entertainment facilities due to its   
 rural setting.  Hence, there are no   
 clubs, hotels or pubs and the         
 population depend on nearby towns for 
 these social amenities.  Nevertheless,
 the district is not totally devoid of 
 all means of entertainment.  Both     
 adults and children can avail of a    
 local riding school.  There is also a 
 pitch and putt course for the less    
 active outdoor enthusiasts.  Pheasant 
 and Wood-Pigeon shooting has increased
 in popularity in recent years due to  
 the camouflage the landscape provides.
 House to house socialising _ "a Ceili"
 is still a prominent feature.  All    
 homes receive 6 television networks:  
 Ulster, BBC 1, BBC 2, RTE 1, RTE 2 and
 Channel 4 in addition to national and 
 local radio.  The latter illegally    
 transmitted from the Irish Republic.  </content>
