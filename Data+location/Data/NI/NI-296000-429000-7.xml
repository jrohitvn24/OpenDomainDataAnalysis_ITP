		<title>07RIVER SYSTEM, DERVOCK.</title>
		<content> The{River Bush}is well known for      
{Salmon, Brown Trout}and{Sea Trout.}It 
 is a meandering river as it crosses   
 the block. 24 miles long, it sometimes
 becomes polluted, mainly by seepage   
 from silage. This problem can lead to 
 many fish dying because they can't get
 oxygen to breathe. Some local farmers 
 have been prosecuted for allowing     
 seepage to run into the nearby        
 streams. A project is being carried   
 out by the{Department of Agriculture  
 to improve the drainage capacity of   
 the river and to cut down flooding in 
 low-lying areas, as this is. The river
 bed is dredged by a mechanical shovel 
 and the material is built along the   
 bank. Some people disagree with this  
 scheme as it removes plant food       
 needed by fish. The main tributary    
 of the Bush is the{Stracam River,     
 which flows through{Dervock.          </content>
