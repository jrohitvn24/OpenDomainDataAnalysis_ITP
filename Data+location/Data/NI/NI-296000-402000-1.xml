		<content> From the Lower Bann River the land    
 rises gently to the west and more     
 steeply to the east. Along the river  
 are areas of forest, rough pastue and 
 bogland. Some of the peat is cut for  
 fuel.                                 
 Many of the rural population are      
 farmers who own land between 30 and 60
 acres in extent. Some combine         
 farming with a trade. Agriculture is  
 principally livestock rearing with    
 some arable.                          
 The rural area is densely populated,  
 the houses being built in loose ribbon
 development a little way back from te 
 roads.                                
 Portglenone provides services and     
 shops for the immediate hinterland,but
 hs no industries.Those who do not find
 employment in the town travel to      
 Ballymena or even further daily. many 
 are tradesmen.                        </content>
