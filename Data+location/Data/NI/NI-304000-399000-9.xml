		<content> The outstanding feature of this rural 
 area is the hedgerow which provides   
 the habitat for a wide range of plants
 and wildlife.The hedges are mainly of 
{hawthorn}and{blackthorn}with climbing 
 plants like{dog rose,honeysuckle and  
{ivy}throughout. Atthe base of these   
 hedges there is often an earth bank on
 which many wild flowers are found in  
 season;e.g.{snowdrop,primrose,violet} 
 and common weed flowers like{         
{dandylion, daisy and buttercup.}      
  There is no woodland except a small  
 stand of{beeches around Glebe House,} 
 and clumps of{birches in Straid Moss.}
 But large numbers can be found along  
 the hedges,mainly{decidious like;ash, 
{horsechestnut,sycamore,beech and oak. 
  Recent farm developments which are   
 draining fields or enlarging the size 
 of fields has led to many of these    
 hedges and trees being destroyed.     </content>
