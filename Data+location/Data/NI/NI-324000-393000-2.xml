		<title>02The Beetles at Tildarg</title>
		<content>   Two  beetling engines worked here in
 separate  buildings  until  tne  early
 1950's . The upper buildings housed an
 overshot{WATERWHEEL}some  40  feet  in
 diameter   whilst   the  larger  lower
 building has 3 massive   48 foot wheel
 . Water from  Tildarg  dam powered the
 lower wheel  but  the upper wheel used
 the{ENERGY}of water  from  Breckenhill
 dam,which lies to the west.           
   Beetling was the name given  to  the
 process   in  which{  LINEN WEBS} were
 pounded  for several days to produce a
 sheen  on  the woven bleached{DAMASK},
 or to   close  the  weave  in  dyed or
 bleached cloth . The webs were pounded
 by the rhythmic fall of  heavy  wooden
 fallers  or  beetles  as  they  slowly
 rotated on a beam at the base  of  the
 "engine" . The   beetles  some  25  in
 number  were  hand  made  and arranged
 along the frame like organ pipes .    </content>
