		<title>06FAMILY WEEKEND</title>
		<content> Every Saturday morning the two        
 children get up at about 9:45 to watch
 television or play games on their     
 computer. Later the parents get up to 
 make breakfast of bacon, eggs and tea.
 In the afternoon the children go out  
 with their dad to play golf or tennis.
 When they arrive back they get their  
 dinner and later usually sit down to  
 watch T.V. Sometimes the boys go to   
 their friends' house to play pool or  
 football.                             
 On Sundays the whole family must go to
 Mass from 11:00 to 11:50.After lunch  
 they go out to play some sort of sport
 like golf, tennis or table tennis. If 
 the weather is bad they would stay    
 inside and probably watch T.V. During 
 the summer in good weather they go    
 down to the beach to swim or sunbathe.
