 Fashion today varies.Men and women    
 wear basically the same type of       
 clothes.For example shorts during     
 the summer and three quarter length   
 trousers.Also the hair- styles are    
 the same.Alot of people have their    
 hair spiked or even dyed a            
 particular colour.Some people have    
 their hair bleached we call these     
 streaks.Although the hair maybe shaped
 differently,men and women mostly have 
 their hair short apart from the       
 occasional person who still prefer to 
 have their hair still long.
