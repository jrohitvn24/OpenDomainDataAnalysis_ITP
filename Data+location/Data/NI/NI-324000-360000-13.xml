		<title>13SIR ROBERT HART</title>
		<content> From Rt. Hon. Douglas Hurd, Home      
                                       
 Secretary on Sir Robert Hart          
                                       
                                       
 "Sir Robert Hart clearly was a        
 remarkable man and if you read what he
 wrote about China, he was a prophet.  
 He did forsee that China would take a 
 big step onto the world's stage and be
 an enormous influence and i think he  
 recognised the great qualities of the 
 Chinese people.                       
                                       
                   I am delighted that 
 Ravarnette Primary School has done the
 research into him, I think it is a    
 very interesting project and I think  
 it deserves, and i am sure it will get
 a wide audience."
