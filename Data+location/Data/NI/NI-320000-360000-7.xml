		<content>{Double-deck lorry trailers.}29        
 June 1985.F.Wilson Engineering of     
 Agnatrisk Road,Culcavey has just      
 announced details of the production of
 it's new invention - a double deck    
 lorry trailer.                        
 This trailer is to be the  only       
 general purpose model in the world    
 with working headroom on each of its  
 two decks.It has 25% more cubic       
 capacity than a standard trailer but  
 the main advantage is that it has 65% 
 more floor space.In many cases two of 
 the Wilson trailers will do the work  
 of conventional ones because the goods
 they carry will not suffer damage when
 they are stacked on top of each other.
 The chairman Mr. Fred Wilson has      
 forecast that the work force at       
 Culcavey should be increased from 60  
 to 100 by the end of 1985.
