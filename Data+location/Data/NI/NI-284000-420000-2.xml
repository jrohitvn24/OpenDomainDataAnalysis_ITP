		<content>   The{1985 summer}was very bad.It     
{rained}at some part of every day for 3
 months.Sometimes the rain was very    
 heavy indeed and roads,fields and     
 houses were{flooded}and rivers        
 overflowed.                           
{  Farmers}had great difficulty in     
 making{hay,}cutting{silage}and        
 harvesting their{barley.}On some farms
 most of the crop was lost.Many        
{potatoes}were blighted and others have
 rotted in the wet ground.             
   On{Thursday 25th July}there was a   
 great{thunderstorm}which lasted for 12
 hours and the lightning was so severe 
 that many people were terrified and   
 thought it was the end of the         
 world.Some{animals were killed}in the 
 fields and{houses damaged}by the      
 lightning.Old people,some as old as 90
 could not remember{a summer as bad as 
{this one.                             </content>
