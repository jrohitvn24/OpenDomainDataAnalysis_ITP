 OUR AREA IS BOUNDED TO THE WEST BY THE
 RIVER FOYLE AND TO THE NORTH BY THE   
 DENNETT RIVER. TO THE SOUTH THE BORDER
 IS FORMED BY THE GLENMORNAN BURN.THE  
 SCHOOL IS ALMOST IN THE CENTRE AND THE
 VIEW FROM IT IS TYPICAL OF THE AREA.  
 ST.MARY'S IS SITUATED ON TOP OF A HILL
 OVERLOOKING THE MAIN STRABANE TO DERRY
 RD.ON WHICH STANDS THE COACH INN.BELOW
 THIS WE HAVE A FLAT ARABLE PLAIN WHICH
 STRETCHES TO THE FOYLE.THIS PLAIN IS  
 PARTLY COVERED BY A SMALL WOOD AND IS 
 DRAINED BY THE DENNETT RIVER.THE AREA 
 AROUND THE SCHOOL IS HILLY,COVERED BY 
 RICH GRASS.A FEW LARGE FARMS OF ABOUT 
 300 ACRES ARE WORKED IN THE AREA BUT  
 THE AVERAGE SIZE IS 80 ACRES.REARING  
 BEEF AND DAIRY HERDS IS THE MAIN TASK 
 BUT MORE RECENTLY SHEEP HAVE BEEN ON  
 THE INCREASE.                         </content>
