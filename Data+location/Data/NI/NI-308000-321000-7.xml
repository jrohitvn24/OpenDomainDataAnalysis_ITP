		<title>07THE NEWRY CANAL</title>
		<content> The Newry Canal is bordered on one    
 side by a road, a forest and a disused
 Newry_Greenore railway line and on the
 opposite side by the Clanrye River.   
 It has an average width of 30-50      
 metres and a depth of 4-5 metres.     
 With the coming of rail and commercial
 road transport the Newry_inland canal 
 declined in importance and slowly sank
 into a state of disuse.  The canal has
 long since ceased to be in a position 
 to permit the passage of any type of  
 vessel and its function is now that of
 a drainage channel.  The canal is used
 for different recreational activities 
 such as canoeing practices by         
 university students and fishing, with 
 roache and pike being the most common 
 type of fish.  In recent times the    
 canal has claimed 10 suicide victims. 
 Recently the World Coarse Fishing     
 Championships were held on it.        </content>
