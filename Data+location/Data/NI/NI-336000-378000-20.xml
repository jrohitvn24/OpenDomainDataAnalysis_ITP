		<title>20THE LEISURE SURVEY 60+</title>
		<content>    The 60+ age groups' interests were 
 not as energetic as the younger age   
 groups.  The kinds of things they     
 enjoyed doing were:- bowls, gardening,
 wood-work, watching television and    
 going to the Golden Age Club.         
    This age group did not go to very  
 many clubs, but the ones they did go  
 to were:- a Health Clinic Club and the
 Golden Age Club.                      
    Everyone in the 60+ age group      
 wanted a leisure centre.  Their       
 reasons were:- Holywood should have   
 similar facilities as Belfast which   
 would prevent travelling back and     
 forth for the young children and      
 young people and the community needed 
 it.                                   
    They would like to see indoor and  
 outdoor squash courts, swimming and   
 old time dancing.
