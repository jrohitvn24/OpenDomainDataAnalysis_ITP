		<title>03Farming - Land</title>
		<content>  The land surrounding Comber is less  
 than 200ft above sea level.About half 
 is undulating with little hills called
 drumlins.The other half is flat,      
 reclaimed land.The soil is very       
 fertile and there is light rainfall   
 and high sunshine average which       
 makesthe area very suitable for market
 gardening.Most farmers specialise in  
 potatoes,vegatables and some barley   
 crops.They supply the local markets   
 with their vegatables  and also the   
 city of Belfast.                      
  There are a few dairy farms and some 
 sheep grazing on higher ground but    
 this type of farming is not so        
 significant.                          
  Farmers are now employing fewer      
 labourers since they have become more 
 mechanised.They are annoyed by the    
 increasing burden of clerical work and
 government restrictions.              </content>
