		<content>   On the steep east face a cave can be
 seen which is marked on Ordnance      
 Survey maps as{O'Haughan's Cave.Aeneas
{(Nessie)O'Haughan}was a notorious     
 robber,tory or rapparee.Many of these 
 were formerly of respectable back-    
 ground, but having been dispossessed  
 during the Williamite wars of the late
 17th century, attacked and robbed     
 travellers and homesteads during the  
 economic crisis which followed.He was 
 eventually captured in Dundalk,brought
 back and tried at Carrickfergus where 
 he was hanged in 1714.                
   The hill attracts such affection    
 from those who live within its benign 
 influence that the name{KNOCKAGH}is   
 universally used.Local organizations, 
 from Women's Institute to Scouts have 
 "Knockagh" in their titles. Houses and
 streets use the name and the local    
 council ward is now called{Knockagh.} </content>
