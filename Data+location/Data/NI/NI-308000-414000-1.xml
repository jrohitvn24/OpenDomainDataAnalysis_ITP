		<content> The block consists mainly of{farmland}
 where the farmers rear mostly{dairy   
{cattle,}beef cattle and sheep. They   
 grow{hay and silage}for winter fodder 
 and{grass}for summer grazing. Barley  
 and potatoes are also grown. The land 
 ranges in{height}from 102m above sea  
 level in the S.W. to 226m in the      
 north. The underlying rock is{basalt} 
 which reaches the surface in several  
 places especially in the centre of the
 block. In the south a ridge of basalt 
 is the site of an old{ruined castle}  
 near which lies{the village of Clough.
 The village consists of a fairly wide 
 main street with houses down one side.
 This is the oldest part of the        
 village. There are three small housing
 estates, one of which has just been   
 completed. The village also has a{    
{small general store, three churches}  
 and{a primary school.}                </content>
