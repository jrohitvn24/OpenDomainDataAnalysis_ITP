   We took part in a school exchange   
with pupils from a number of schools in
Denmark. Forty five pupils took part in
the exchange from four different       
schools, two in Derry and two in       
Limavady. From this arrangement a      
mixture of people from different       
religions and backgrounds were         
assembled.                             
   We travelled by bus to Larne crossed
to Scotland and then by train to       
Harwich and finally by ship and boat to
our final destination.                 
   We were to attend four schools in   
the north of Denmark on Jylland. I was 
hosted by the Winkle family and their  
daughter Anita to whom I had been      
writing for three months.
