		<content> Because it was , and is ,run by the { 
{Belfast Chartitable Society}it        
 depended on donations and             
 money-raising ideas.One of these  came
 from the fact that it had it's own {  
{Spring  water.}It raised money by     
 selling water door to door from       
 barrel's on water carts.Later the     
 water was piped though {elm pipes}over
 a large part of Belfast.As a result of
 this even today the society receives  
 Â£800 a year and{free water.}Clifton   
 House{today is a home for 144 old     
{people}of "good character".Once       
 admitted they can stay for as long as 
 they need to.Any residents taken ill  
 can be treated in Clifton House.They  
 live in two bedded rooms or in wards  
 if they are ill.Everyone contributes  
 what they can to their upkeep but     
 no-one is turned away because they    
 have no money.                        </content>
