		<title>09THE CHRISTMAS RHYMERS</title>
		<content> "Here comes I, wee Johnny Funny,      
 I'm the one that lifts the money.     
 All silver, no brass,                 
 Bad hae'pennies won't pass!"          
 These are the closing lines of a play 
 dating back to Medieval times, which  
 has been revived by Gleno Young       
 Farmers' Club, and performed in the   
 houses of their friends, and in local 
 inns, in the weeks before Christmas.  
 This Mummers' play is still performed 
 in different parts of the country,    
 with small local differences. The     
 story is of a fight between the hero  
 and his enemy. The bringing back of   
 the dead enemy to life shows the      
 supernatural beliefs from             
 pre-Christian times. The underlying   
 significance has been long lost, and  
 the play allows the young farmers     
 access for their high spirits, and an 
 opportunity to collect for charity.   </content>
