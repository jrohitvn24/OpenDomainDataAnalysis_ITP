		<content> The largest building in the area apart
 from the Castle, is Mount Panther     
 house. This is unfortunately now a    
 burnt-out shell of a once-beautiful   
 early 19th Century brick house.       
 Ballykinlar RAF camp is a conglomer-  
 ation of typical Services buildings.  
 Because of the political problems     
 here, security is tight and all       
 service personnel and their families  
 live within the confines of the base. 
 The base provides a considerable      
 amount of work and trade for local    
 tradesmen such as builders and joiners
 and for the local shops, although the 
 Dundrum pubs are off-limits and many  
 families, since they need to travel by
 car to the shops, would tend to bypass
 Dundrum in favour of the better       
 selection of shops in Newcastle,      
 Downpatrick or further afield.
