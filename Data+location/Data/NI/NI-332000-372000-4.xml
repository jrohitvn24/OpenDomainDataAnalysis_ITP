		<content> When I get home from school I do my   
 homework. It takes me half an hour to 
 do this. Then I change from my school 
 uniform into old cloths and go out to 
 play. My next door neighbour has pups 
 which I take for walks. If I don't    
 play with The pups I call for my      
 friend and we play together until     
 teatime. My mummy sometimes asks me to
 go to the shops for her. After tea I  
 either go out to play again or watch  
 television. If my daddy doesn't go to 
 the pub he gets a video and we watch  
 that.I like The Horror ones. This year
 The Girl Guides are celebrating their 
 seventy-fifth birthday. I am in the   
 Brownies. I joined them when I was    
 eight and I will become a Guide when I
 am eleven. We are going camping,having
 a barbecue and best of all a birthday 
 party for all the Brownies in Northern
 Ireland.                              </content>
