 When I have to go to school I get up  
 around 8 o'clock and chage my         
 clothes. I come downstairs and get my 
 breakfast.I do not get the same       
 breakfast every morning but most days 
 I get bacon, fried bread and tea. When
 I have finished I go upstairs to brush
 my teeth and brace.Then I go          
 downstairs put my shoes on,get my     
 school bag and go down the lane to    
 wait for the bus. It usually comes    
 around twenty-five to nine. When I get
 on the bus there not usually many more
 people to lift on the way to school.We
 arrive in school at about a quarter to
 nine and we have play-time. Next      
 play-time is at a quarter to eleven   
 and when we come in it is time for    
 maths. At half past twelve we have    
 dinner and at one o'clock we have a   
 play-time until half past one.        </content>
