		<content>    In {Ballynure }there is one primary
 school  which  was  built  about  1930
 (replacing the  National school  built
 in 1848).                             
    The  school  has  five teachers and
{five classrooms and  about 150 pupils.
   In {Ballyeaston}there is one disused
 primary  school. It was  built in 1840
 and was closed in  the  1960's, due to
 falling numbers of pupils.This was the
 fate of a great  many small schools in
 rural communities in the province.    
    Not  all  of  the  children in this
 area attend{Ballynure Primary  school.
 Some  find it more convenient to go to
 primary  schools  in  Ballyboley or in
 Ballyclare.                           
   When the pupils are eleven years old
 they have to travel to a  secondary or
 high school in{Ballyclare}or{Larne.
