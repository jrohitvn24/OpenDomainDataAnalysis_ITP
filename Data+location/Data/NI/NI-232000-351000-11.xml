 the village although not all are      
 visited regularly.These shops sell    
 clothes,meat,farm-machinery,drink,    
 sweets,toys,groceries and petrol.The  
 opening hours are very varied.The     
 grocery shops are visited most often  
 because they sell papers and fresh    
 goods such as bread and vegetables.   
 Their busiest time is the weekend.They
 even open on a Sunday after Church to 
 sell the papers.                      
     People also come to the Post      
 Office to collect their benifits.If   
 they are ill they go to the doctor's  
 surgery or to one of the two chemists.
