		<title>06FARMING IN NEWTOWNARDS</title>
		<content> About 6 farmers work the 400 acres    
 used for agriculture in our area.     
 Grass covering 300 acres is used for  
 livestock, 200 acres are grazed by 250
 beef cattle. Dairy farming comprises  
 100 acres with 80 - 90 cows, each     
 producing over 1000 gallons of milk a 
 year. The vegetables grown on 30 acres
 include cabbage, cauliflower, carrots 
 and pamphrey. Cereal crops cover 30   
 acres: 10 acres in winter barley and  
 20 acres in spring barley. Potatoes   
 are grown on l2 acres. Flax is a crop 
 recently re-introduced in the area due
 to new labour saving harvesting       
 methods and covers 20 acres but is    
 increasing annually. Ards Malting     
 Company serves as a receiving depot   
 for farmers in surrounding areas who  
 grow malting barley. There it is made 
 into malt which is later transported  
 to Bushmills for whiskey making.      </content>
