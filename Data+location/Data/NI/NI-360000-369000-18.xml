		<title>18Clubs in Ballywalter</title>
		<content>    Ballywalter is just a small village
 but it has many clubs for old and     
 young people.                         
    There is the Bowling Club just     
 outside Ballywalter. It is open every 
 Tuesday and Saturday. It is mostly    
 farmers who go to the Bowling Club but
 a few people from Ballywalter go as   
 well.                                 
    The two churches have badminton    
 clubs and one has an indoor bowling   
 club. The young farmers go to the Y.  
 F.C.- that is the Young Farmers' Club 
 They get together and have dances and 
 talks. It is on Wednesday for Seniors 
 and Friday for Juniors.               
    In the pub men play darts and      
 sometimes even professional dart      
 players come.                         
    There are organisations for        
 children - Boys' Brigade, Girls'      
 Brigade and the Youth Club.           </content>
