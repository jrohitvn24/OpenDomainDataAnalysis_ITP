		<content>                                       
     Yesterday was Wednesday and I had 
 to go for my interview at my new      
 school,Bangor Grammar School.I had to 
 see my Housemaster who looks after the
 pupils in Ward House to see if they   
 settle in to their new school.        
     He asked me various questions     
 like: What's your favourite television
 programme? What's your favourite      
 sport? Do you have a hobby? He gave me
 some leaflets and then I had to wait  
 for a while before seeing the         
 headmaster Mr.Patton.                 
     Once I was in his office he asked 
 my Dad to sign a document saying that 
 I would be allowed to go to the       
 school.                               
     After I left his office,I went    
 back to school to play rugby.
