		<title>11RAIL TRANSPORT, DUNMURRY</title>
		<content> The main Belfast to Dublin railway    
 line runs through Dunmurry. It is a   
 busy line carrying both passengers and
 goods. In the morning there are trains
 nearly every ten minutes. The first   
 passenger train is at 0655 hrs. The   
 Dublin express swishes past at 0800   
 hrs. The morning trains usually carry 
 people to and from their work and     
 schools.                              
 When a train comes to the place where 
 it crosses a road near the heart of   
 the village, the road-crossing bell   
 rings, and red lights flash. THen the 
 gates close and allow the train to    
 pass while the cars are stopped. The  
 train blows its horn noisily before it
 reaches the crossing which is on a    
 minor road. Dunmurry has an unmanned  
 station at which some of the trains   
 stop.
