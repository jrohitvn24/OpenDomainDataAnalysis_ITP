		<content> This survey of what people like and   
 dislike in this block, is the result  
 of visits to selected families. {     
{LIKES:  "Because we've always lived   
{here"-}most of the families having    
 come to the area in the Plantation of 
 Ulster in the reign of King James 1.  
{Central location"-}easy access to     
 adjacent A8 to Belfast, Larne,        
 Ballyclare, Ballymena.{"Mild climate"-
 little snow, which soon melts.        
 "Peaceful"- minor roads; low          
 population; neighbours always helpful 
 when needed, but keep to themselves.{ 
{"Good view"-}overlooking the coast and
 surrounding hills.                    
{DISLIKES: "Being snowed in"-}a long,  
 exposed driveway.{"Often windy"-}on   
 the exposed plateau.{"We love living  
{here, but you probably wouldn't"-}the 
 residents feel that others, towns-    
 people especially, would feel lonely. </content>
