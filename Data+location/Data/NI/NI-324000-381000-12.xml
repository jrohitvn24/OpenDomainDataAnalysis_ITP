		<title>12UNITED IRISHMEN</title>
		<content>  Probably the most famous sequences of
 events in Roughfort's history centers 
 on that area in the year 1798.In that 
 year a series of rebellions took place
 in Ireland. the unifying factor was   
 that members of the{United Irishmen}as
 they where called took part in {      
{Co.Antrim}.The"General" of Antrim was 
 Robert Sims,he doubted if a rebellion 
 by the United Irishmen of Antrim      
 against the government would succeed. 
 He resigned and was replaced by Henry 
 Joy McCracken.Henry McCracken was     
 appointed as the new leader and with  
 vigour he planned a new campaign.     
  Intelligence as to what was happening
 in other parts of the country was     
 difficult to assess,but in spite of   
 this the men of Antrim congregated at 
 Roughfort,ready to advance on the town
 of Antrim a garrison town.
