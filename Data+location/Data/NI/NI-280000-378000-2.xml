		<content> As in so many aspects of Ulster life  
 religion is a basic source of division
 in the field of education. The        
 population is divided approsimately   
 50_50 between Protestants and Roman   
 Catholics. The voluntary or Catholic  
 schools are situated on the west side 
 of the main street and the state      
 schools, which are open to all        
 denominations, on the east side.      
   All the state schools are in the    
 same grounds, Coolnafrankie Demense,  
 and estate acquired by the now defunct
 Tyrone Edcation Committee in 1952.    
 The state schools:}                   
 Nursery School: this is one of the    
 most recent inovations and replaces   
 several privately run nurseries.  It  
 opened in May 1978 with 65 pupils ages
 3 to 4 years and this number has      
 remained constant.
