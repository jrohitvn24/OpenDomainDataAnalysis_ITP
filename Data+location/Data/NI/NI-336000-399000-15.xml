		<title>15KILWAUGHTER COACH</title>
		<content>{Harvey's Mill}is in{Kilwaughter.}In it
{Squire Agnew's coach}is found - the   
 paint of the body faded but the door  
 crests still quite clear and the faded
 blue velvet ceiling lining still      
 intact. The coach body is 5 feet high,
 6 feet long, and 4 feet wide, the     
 wooden sheets of the bodywork being   
 gracefully curved. The windows - front
 side and back, have no glass, and the 
 seat covers have disappeared. In an   
 adjoining shed, the massive chassis   
 has been lovingly preserved and       
 repainted in bright colours. The rear 
 wheels, 5 feet high on iron rims, are 
 splayed to accommodate the body. The  
 front wheels are smaller, their axle  
 being fixed to a turning device. The 4
 thick leather straps where the body   
 would be suspended, still hang. The   
 coachman sat high, driving 2 or 4     
 horses, yoked to a centre shaft.      </content>
