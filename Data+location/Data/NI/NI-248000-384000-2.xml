		<title>02        THE CATTLE MARKET</title>
		<content> The Market Day in Gortin used to be   
 called the Fair Day and was held on   
                                       
 the first Wednesday of every month.   
     Nowadays the Market day is held   
 every first Tuesday of the month.Store
 Cattle are sold at the Cattle         
 Market.Sometimes sheep and lambs are  
 sold.The Market yard is beside the    
 burn.It is in  the centre of          
 Gortin.Some of the Cattle that are    
 sold in the Market fetch very good    
 prices.The Fresian cow is very common 
 nowadays.You could get six or seven   
 hundred pounds for a springing heifer.
     A permit is required before       
 bringing cattle to the Market.This is 
 to prevent the spread of diseases such
 as T.B.The animal also needs a tag.On 
 the back of the tag is the number of  
 the herd to which the animal belongs.
