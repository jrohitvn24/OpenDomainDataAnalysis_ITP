		<title>10Housing in Ballywalter</title>
		<content>    When Ballywalte started most of the
 people built their houses along the   
 edge of the coast. The men worked for 
 the farmers on the farms or went      
 fishing. The older houses are still   
 there. Some of these very old houses  
 have no bathrooms or in-door toilets. 
    More people wanted to live in      
 Ballywalter so the council built new  
 houses for them. The ones being built 
 now are very modern and the Housing   
 Executive owns them.                  
    Some of the tenants have found the 
 rents very dear and they decided to   
 buy their houses from the Housing     
 Executive. The Housing Executive      
 builds small houses for old people and
 about eight years ago the Masonic     
 Order built some for them as well.
