		<title>09SURVEY AROUND DAMHEAD.</title>
		<content>  As this area lies halfway between the
 towns of Coleraine and Ballymoney, and
 the holiday resorts of Portstewart,   
 Portrush, and Castlerock are nearby,  
 we did a survey to find out which     
 towns the people used for shopping,   
 entertainment etc.                    
  We found that 75% of the people      
 shopped in Coleraine and 25% in       
 Ballymoney.                           
  The majority of people, who did not  
 work on a farm, worked in Coleraine.  
  The primary school children go to    
 Damhead Primary School. 66% of        
 secondary school children attend      
 schools in Coleraine, the remainder   
 attend Ballymoney schools.            
  For entertainment 90% of people go to
 Coleraine and 10% to Portrush.        
  For a trip to the seaside 63% chose  
 Portstewart, 25% Portrush and 12%     
 Castlerock.                           </content>
