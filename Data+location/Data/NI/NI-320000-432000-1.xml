		<title>01Clady Bridge Glendun</title>
		<content> The middle course of the Glendun River
 flows over a narrow flat flood plain  
 whose meadows are used by farms sited 
 on the valley edge.  Rising abruptly  
 above them are the slopes leading to  
 the moorlands of Crockaneel to the    
 north  and Gruig Top to the south.    
 Rough grazing occupies those steep    
 fields, some now becoming overgrown   
 with scrub, and a residual woodland   
 climbs to the rocky hillside at Clady 
 Bridge.                               
 Glendun was formerly more densely     
 populated but today a thin straggle of
 houses survives  only along the narrow
 lower road on the outskirts of        
 Cushendun villge.                     
 Amenities are few in this secluded    
 valley,though in summer visitors cars 
 stream through as they tour the       
 coastal routes.
