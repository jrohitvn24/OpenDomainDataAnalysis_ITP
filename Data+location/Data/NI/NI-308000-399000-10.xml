		<title>10Day in the life of a farmer</title>
		<content> Farmer Brown and his son David who is 
 seventeen years of age start work each
 morning at 06.30 hrs.First farmer     
 Brown switches on the equipment in the
 milking parlour. David and his collie 
 dog go and collect the cows from the  
 field and bring them up the lane and  
 into the milking parlour.  The whole  
 milking operation lasts one and a half
 hours.  The cows are then taken to the
 field opposite the dwelling house to  
 graze.                                
                                       
 About this time Mrs. Brown will have  
 breakfast ready.  Breakfast consists  
 of cereals, toast and a fry.  An      
 Ulster Fry consists of bacon, eggs,   
 and fried bread. The next job to be   
 done is feeding the calves and pigs.  
 After that David hooks on the silage  
 cutter and goes to cut grass. When he 
 returns he will again milk the cows.  </content>
