		<title>20TRADE IN THE CULMORE AREA</title>
		<content> We distributed 100 surveys in the     
 Culmore area inquiring about shopping.
 We wished to find out which           
 supermarket was most frequently used  
 by the average shopper and also to    
 find which supermarket was cheapest by
 obtaining pricelists,cut out from the 
 local journal.When we collected up our
 information,we put it all together in 
 the form of bar graphs,which showed   
 where people bought fruit,vegetables, 
 shoes,clothes and meat.From all these 
 results we found that the most popular
 supermarkets are situated in:         
 a.The shopping centre at Lisnagelvin  
 b.Ballymagroarty shopping centre      
 c.Superfare supermarket               
 d.The centre of Derry city            
 This shopping pattern shows that the  
 Culmore area is in the rural fringe of
 the city of Derry.
