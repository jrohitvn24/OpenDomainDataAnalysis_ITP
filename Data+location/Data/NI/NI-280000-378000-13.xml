		<content>   There are facilities for a wide     
 variety of sports in Cookstown        
 including soccer,bowls,tennis,squash, 
 swimming,golf,babmington,cycling.     
   The Soccer Club has recently rented 
 its own pitch and in addition two are 
 provided by the local Council,which   
 also provides tennis courts and a     
 bowling green.The Hockey Club uses the
 facilities of the local High          
 School,i.e.two all-weather pitches.The
 school and town club have produced    
 four hocket internationalists in      
 recent years,Joy Henry,Mark           
 Burns,Martin Sloan  and David Larmour.
   The swimming pool is popular with   
 all ages,although there are no        
 competitive swimmers.The pool is      
 unfortunately two metres short of the 
 official length for competitions.This 
 complex also houses two squash        
 courts.An 18  hole golf course exists.</content>
