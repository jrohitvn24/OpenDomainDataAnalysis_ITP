		<content> We prepared a leisure{survey}for our  
 class to take around our{district.}We 
 found how many went out to school, out
 to work,worked at home,were unemployed
 or were retired.  Not enough retired  
 people filled in our form.  We found  
 those who went to school had most{free
{time}4 hours each,each day. The others
 had leisure time each day averaging:- 
 unemployed 3hr 45m, worked at home 3hr
 and out to work 2hr 20m.              
                                       
 The{most popular}leisure activity was 
 watching{television.}We found 75% of  
 our survey watched TV every day       
 averaging 2hr 20m each.  Only one     
 person said they watched TV less than 
 once a week.                          
                                       
 We have four TV channels at present,  
 more are coming by satellite.
