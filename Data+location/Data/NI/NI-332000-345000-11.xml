		<title>11Population trends in Guiness</title>
		<content>  This region is one with a low        
 population density,the inhabitants    
 being dispersed throughout the area in
 isolated farmsteads or smallholdings. 
 There is a population at present of   
 approximately two hundred and fifty   
 people.                               
  Within the last decade the trend in  
 population has shifted from one of    
 de-population to re-population.       
 Originally the young people of the    
 area tended to move to houses in      
 Ballynahinch or other towns.This was  
 because there was a greater chance of 
 getting work in the towns,and there   
 was council housing for young married 
 couples who could not afford to build 
 a house.                              
 Now with the increase in rents,and the
 availability of morgages,those same   
 young people are returning to the area
 and building their own homes.         </content>
