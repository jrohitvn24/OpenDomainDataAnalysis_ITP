		<content> Red Rover                             
 To play 'red Rover' you need two teams
 with five people in each. Each team   
 stands and joins hands at either side 
 of the road. The first team says "Red 
 Rover,red Rover we call" then they    
 shout someone's name from the other   
 team. The person whose name was called
 breaks through the opposing team. If  
 that person gets through they go back 
 to their own side but if that person  
 doesn't they stay where they are.     
 Forty Forty                           
 Forty Forty is similar to hide and    
 seek. To play it one person is        
 'seeker'. That person stands at a post
 and counts to forty while the others  
 go and hide. If the seeker finds      
 someone they run back to the post and 
 shout "Forty, Forty I see." and then  
 the person's name. Then the person    
 whose name was called becomes seeker. </content>
