		<title>15WHERE I LIVE</title>
		<content>  Galgorm is not always dull. When I   
 wake up in the morning I have my      
 breakfast, get dressed and go down to 
 my friend Caroline's house. I wait for
 her while she is having her breakfast 
 and when she has finished we either   
 stay around her house or go cycling.  
  One day Caroline was knocked down by 
 a car while cycling from Galgorm to   
 Clinty Quarry. She ended up with her  
 leg in plaster for most of the summer 
 holidays. She learned never to ride in
 the middle of the road again.         
  Usually I go home for my lunch at 12 
 o'clock but on that day I telephoned  
 my mother from the Casualty Department
 of the Hospital to tell her I was     
 waiting to see that Caroline was      
 alright.                              
  I loved Galgorm and I would never    
 move away from it even if I was       
 offered a million pounds.             </content>
