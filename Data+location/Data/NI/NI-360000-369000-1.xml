		<content>        Ballywalter is a village on the
 east coast of Northern Ireland. It is 
 positioned on the Ards Peninsula which
 is about 37 km long and 4 km wide. On 
 a clear day you can see south west    
 Scotland and the Isle of Man.         
     Ballywalter is mainly a farming   
 area and the land near the sea is     
 fairly flat and sandy. There are some 
 hills called drumlins which were      
 formed in the ice-age.                
     The farmers around Ballywalter are
 mainly dairy and beef farmers but     
 there are some who grow barley, wheat,
 oats and flax.                        
     There are only two factories in   
 Ballywalter.  One employs a lot of    
 women and they make suits. The other  
 factory makes engineering equipment.  
     The harbour was built over l00    
 years ago but is now mainly used by   
 holiday-makers.                       </content>
