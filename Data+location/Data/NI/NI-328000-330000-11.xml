		<content> Most of the children of Primary school
 age go to either St Malachy's Primary 
 School in Kilcoo or to Newcastle or   
 Castlewellan Primary Schools. School  
 buses collect the children for the    
 journeys. Secondary schooling takes   
 older children to Castlewellan or, if 
 they are able to attend Grammar School
 most of the girls would go to         
 Ballynahinch and the boys to          
 Downpatrick.                          
 Most people would use Castlewellan or 
 Newcastle for shopping (though the    
 small shops in Kilcoo, Bryansford and 
 Burrenbridge make a living. Many      
 shoppers from this block would tend   
 towards Newry and even Dublin before  
 Belfast for major items. (Newry's     
 prominence has grown in recent years  
 as a result of the price differences  
 between the Republic of Ireland and   
 the North.                            </content>
