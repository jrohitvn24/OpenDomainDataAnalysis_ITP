		<content> 2.{DAIRY FARMING   }                  
  Mr. Hanna's 30 acre dairy farm lies  
 on gently rolling lowlands in the     
 south east of the study area. He      
 employs no full-time workers but his  
 sons Cyril and Robert help him at     
 milking times - early morning and     
 early evening, e.g. cleaning out the  
 milking parlour. The milk is collected
 once daily and taken to the creamery  
 at Banbridge, 25 miles away.          
  In the summer Mr. Hanna keeps around 
 35 milking cows and 20 calves - in    
 winter this is 5 to 10 less.          
  Mr. Hanna's grandfather bought the   
 farm at the turn of the century but   
 new sheds and a new farmhouse have    
 since been added - the old sheds today
 being used as stores and a calving    
 house.
