		<content> There are four floors in the building.
 Two of them are occupied by the       
 Assembly members. The other two floors
 are used by the D.O.E.                
 At the head of the stairs leading to  
 the first floor there is a statue of  
 Lord Craigavon, the first prime       
 minister of N.I. He is buried along   
 with his wife in the grounds to the   
 east of the buildings.                
 Not far from the Parliment Buildings  
 there are a number of large buildings 
 which are occupied by the Civil       
 Service of N.I. Extensive playing     
 fields and a huge pavilion cater for  
 the sporting needs of the Civil       
 Service personnel.
