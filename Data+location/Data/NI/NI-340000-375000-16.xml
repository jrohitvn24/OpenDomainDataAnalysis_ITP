 On 13th June 1985 we went in the      
 school minibus to Carrowreagh  Farm.  
 It is situated on the left of the     
 Carrowreagh Road about 200 metres from
 the junction with the Upper           
 Newtownards Road.The farm is one of   
 two units owned by the                
 Blakiston-Houston Estate Company.The  
 second unit is on the Ballymiscaw Road
 which leads to Belfast.Mr.Crawford,the
 Manager,showed us around.Both units   
 extend to 275 hectares and the main   
 enterprise is dairying.There are up to
 350 milking British Fresian cows and  
 three Aberdeen Angus bulls on the     
 farm.Dairying was probably started    
 because there was a ready market for  
 milk in the nearby city of Belfast, in
 the days when it was bottled on the   
 farm.
