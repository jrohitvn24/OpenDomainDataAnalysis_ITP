		<content> The people in the area enjoy a wide   
 range of recreational activities. The 
 town of Antrim is well provided for in
 the form of sporting and social clubs.
 The main{club}in our area is the      
 Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club which    
 draws quite a number of members from  
 the housing estates which are adjacent
 to it.                                
 The most popular club in our survey   
 was the Enkalon Sports and Social Club
 which has remained in existence even  
 after the factory closed.             
{Sport }The area is fortunate to have  
 Antrim Forum Sports Complex which     
 caters for most sports.  Swimming,    
 darts and snooker are the most popular
 indoor pastimes.  Jogging and keep_fit
 are also popular.
