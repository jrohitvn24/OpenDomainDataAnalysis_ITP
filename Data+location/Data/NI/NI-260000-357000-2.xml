		<content>  The people of the area could be      
 divided into two well_defined and     
 almost separate groups,namely         
 Catholics and Protestants.These live  
 peacefully together yet most live     
 separately from each other.They each  
 have their own schools,halls,sports,  
 pastimes,celebrations and             
 interests.The so_called "Troubles"of  
 the past sixteen years would be a     
 constant topic of conversation and    
 source of concern for the people of   
 the area as would be the case         
 elsewhere in Northern Ireland.Although
 there have been a few serious         
 incidents in the area people still,   
 generally speaking manage             
 to live peacefully together.Many of   
 course do work together and mix       
 socially in spite of the very obvious 
 sectarian division.
