		<content> As much as 70% of the housing in the  
 block has been built in the past 20   
 years. Since 1963 two large estates   
 have been built by the N.I. Housing   
 Executive and two large private       
 developments of owner-occupied housing
 have been completed.                  
                                       
 Forty nine war_time "Prefabs" and some
 old "Fishermen's Cottages" have been  
 demolished.                           
                                       
 Traditionally houses locally have been
 stone built with slate roofs and often
 of one and a half storeys.            
                                       
 The most common type today would be a 
 three-bedroomed, brick or block built,
 tiled roof, semi-detached house.      
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
