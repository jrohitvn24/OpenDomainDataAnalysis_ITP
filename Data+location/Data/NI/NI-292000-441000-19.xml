		<content>    We interviewed Mrs.E.Montgomery    
 about how the{area has changed in the 
{past years.                           
   She has lived in the area for       
 seventy-five years and went to        
 school at the Montgomery Memorial.    
    Children{started school at four    
 years of age and{left at fourteen.    
 Very few children went to a secondary 
 school.                               
    Few children had shoes and the     
 school was heated by a coal fire. The 
 children sat at square desks or       
 benches.                              
    A cane was used by the teacher if  
 you were bad. There were three        
 teachers at the school with about     
 thirty children each.                 
    The school holidays were not as    
 long as our present holidays.
