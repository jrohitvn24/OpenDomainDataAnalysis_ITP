		<content>  Comber is not an industrial town.Two 
 places that employ workers are        
 Spacedyers and Albion Clothing.       
  In{Spacedyers}they employ 26 workers 
 and 7 staff.They do not dye yarn as   
 most people think.Instead they print  
 carpets and make carpet underlay.Some 
 of the designs they make up themselves
 with nails and bits of rubber.They do 
 this to have more customers and to    
 help them keep prices low.            
  The{Albion Clothing}factory makes    
 men's and boys'trousers and to do this
 they employ 66 people,3 men and 63    
 women.They have to keep changing the  
 fashion and have competitive          
 prices.Most fathers have to find work 
 outside Comber but the mothers mostly 
 work in Comber at jobs such as        
 cleaners,shop assistants etc.
