 I visited Reihill-Mc Keowns on Friday 
 31st May 1985. The full name of the   
 business is{Reihill-Mc Keown Ltd.} It 
 was established in Irvinestown in     
 1928. The two firms amalgamated in    
 1973. They deliver beers, spirits,    
 minerals etc.                         
     They employ 15 there. There are 4 
 working in the office, 8 drivers, 2   
 garage-men and 1 foreman. There are no
 plans for expansion in the business   
 at the moment.                        
     While I was there I saw the       
 warehouse  where they keep all the    
 minerals, spirits etc. They have a    
 special part of the warehouse         
 centrally heated to keep{Guinness.}In 
 the winter the Guinness must be kept  
 warm so that it wouldn't go sour. I   
 saw the fork-lift which could lift    
 many crates high.                     </content>
