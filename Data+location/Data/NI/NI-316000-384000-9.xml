		<content> The natural vegetation of the area    
 would be decidious woodland but this  
 has been radically altered since      
 acient times by men for farming and   
 for dwellings.  Now the area's main   
 enviromental cover is{grassland       
 farming away from Antrim, and         
 residential developments closer to it.
 In other areas when farming and       
 housing are not possible the natural  
 vegetation develops.                  
 The Six Mile Water River which flows  
 through this area has been greatly    
 affected by industry, especially in   
 the last century.  It is now          
 recovering to a more natural state.   
{Polution}in the river is monitored    
 regularly and the river is generally  
 unpoluted.                            
 This is important since it flows into 
 Lough Neagh which provides water to   
 urban centres.                        </content>
