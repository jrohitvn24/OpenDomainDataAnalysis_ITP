		<title>10Occupations in Guiness.</title>
		<content> Occupations in the block vary greatly.
 Although farming is important as an   
 occupation,it is a very poor employer.
 The advent of modern machinery,and the
 small size of farms,means that few    
 people are fully employed in farming. 
  The younger males are mostly employed
 in the building trade,or in trade     
 apprentiships.The females are employed
 in the catering or service industries,
 or in nursing.In the older groups,    
 occupations vary from teaching to     
 office workers,building industry,     
 managment,and mechanical occupations  
 such as garage workers or car dealers.
  In the majority of households both   
 partners work.Most people travel      
 outside the block to find employment.
