		<content> The size of the church has grown      
 enormously and he himself is the      
 second longest-serving vicar in       
 Northern Ireland.                     
                                       
 Inside the church to the left of the  
 altar was a piece of French brocade   
 tapestry which turned blue and gold   
 when the light shone on it.  To the   
 right of the altar was a beautiful    
 gold eagle-shaped lectern which had   
 what looked like a white scarf hanging
 round its' neck.  The window at the   
 front was made up of five stained     
 glass windows and, on each side, there
 were five smaller stained glass       
 windows and there was one big window  
 at the back.  The entire church was   
 fitted with a red carpet and the      
 covering for the seats were also red, 
 there were little red praying cushions
 as well.                              </content>
