		<content> Our school is constructed of red brick
 with a slated roof.It was built in    
 1935 for two teachers and 64 pupils.  
 The original building had only two    
 rooms and a small store room.The      
 toilets were dry toilets, near the    
 present oil store.                    
    In 1962 a dining room, kitchen and 
 inside toilets were added.            
    The roll numbers increased and the 
 dining room was used as a classroom.  
    Another toilet for the younger     
 children was added in 1985.           
    68 children enrolled in Tamnamore  
 Primary School.
