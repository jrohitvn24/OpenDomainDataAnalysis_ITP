		<content> Hilden Voluntary Primary School was   
 started by the Barbour family to      
 educate their mill workers.  It was   
 originally inside the mill complex but
 in 1919 a separate building was       
 provided.  This school is almost      
 unique in N.Ireland being a voluntary 
 primary school.  It educates both     
 Protestants and Catholics and still   
 retains very close links with the     
 mill.  It receives grants, equipment  
 and supplies from the Department of   
 Education but the main decisions      
 regarding its running are still taken 
 by the management of the mill.  It has
 135 pupils and 5 staff.               
 There is one other primary school in  
 the area, Hillhall Primary School, but
 it is a controlled school run by the  
 South-Eastern Education and Library   
 Board.  All pupils of secondary age   
 travel to Lisburn or Belfast.         </content>
