		<title>05A GREENISLAND GIRL'S DAY(1)</title>
		<content>      My name is{JULIE ROBINSON.}      
  In the room that I share with Ruth,my
 sister, the alarm clock rings at 7:30.
 Immediately I jump out of bed,switch  
 it off and then crawl back in again   
 hoping for a few extra minutes sleep. 
  I do get a chance to lie in on Sunday
 mornings though.The church service    
 doesn't begin until 10:30.            
   In the mornings I love eating Rice- 
 krispies followed by tea and toast    
 while Mum prepares my school lunch.   
   As I am eleven it is my last year at
 primary school and hopefully if I pass
 the selection examination I will go to
 grammar school next year.             
   In school my favourite subjects are 
 English and P.E. and each day I enjoy 
 a different after_school activity     
 -(hockey,badminton,dancing,orchestra  
 and Scripture Union).When I get home  
 I have to do a homework.(Worse luck.) </content>
