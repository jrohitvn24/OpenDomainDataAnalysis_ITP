		<title>09 Bushmills Centre</title>
		<content> Bushmills Centre is a residential     
centre for young people run by the     
North Eastern Education and Library    
Board.  It is used by youth groups and 
school groups for activities such as   
conferences, geographical and          
biological fieldwork and outdoor       
pursuit activities such as canoeing,   
climbing and sailing.  The centre      
occupies the building which was        
formerly the old Bushmills Grammar     
School which became comprehensive and  
moved to a new site in 1974.  The      
centre was opened in 1979.             
                                       
 In the outdoor centre there are a     
total of fourteen workers.  They       
consist of cooks, cleaners, stores,    
office and instructional staff.  At the
most, during the week, they have thirty
visiting young people and staff and at 
the week-end they have twenty-five.    </content>
