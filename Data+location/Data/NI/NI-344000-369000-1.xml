 architectural importance.             
  The Enler river is another one.In the
 river there are lots of fish(eg sea   
 trout,brown trout and rainbow trout).

 and valuable.Most of the land is used 
 for market gardening,especially       
 potatoes.Comber is very famous for    
 it's potatoes.The land is expensive   
 therefore building is restrained.
