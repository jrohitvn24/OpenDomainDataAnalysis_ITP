		<title>04ARDMORE STATION</title>
		<content> Opened in 1883 Ardmore Station hasn't 
 been running for over 30 years.  My   
 great granny and grandpa Mr and Mrs   
 Hunter lived in the station house.  My
 great grandpa worked in Limavady      
 Station but my great grannny worked in
 Ardmore Station as the caretaker.  The
 station was quite small and only three
 trains came in a day except for       
 excursions.  Because the Limavady to  
 Dungiven line was only 14 miles long, 
 there was no need for corridors, and  
 it is said that only first class      
 carriages were used.  The Ardmore     
 Bridge, over which the trains used to 
 pass, has now been knocked down.
