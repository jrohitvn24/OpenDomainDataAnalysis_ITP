		<content> some farmers are introducing Charolais
 blood into their stock.               
 Field crops tend to concentrate on    
 fodder crops such as hay, silage,     
 oats, barley and kale. Turnips are    
 grown for sheep. As a result of this  
 year's cool, wet summer, many farmers 
 have been unable to cut as much hay as
 they need. Barley straw has also been 
 scarce as the farmers have been lucky 
 to get the grain off the fields. Many 
 farmers have changed to bagged silage 
 making this year. This requires less  
 capital outlay than a silage tower and
 the large black polythene bags of     
 silage are simply left in the fields  
 and opened whenever needed. One bag   
 contains enough feed for about 30     
 cattle for one day. The only problem  
 is the danger of a small tear in the  
 bag which, by allowing air in, lets   
 the grass rot, not ferment.           </content>
