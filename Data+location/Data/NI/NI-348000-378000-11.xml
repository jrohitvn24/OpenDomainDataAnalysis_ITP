 1. Any number of people can play.     
 2. {Rules:_ }There are two dens. You  
    have to get from one den to the    
    other den if your name is called by
    the catcher in between the two     
    dens. If you are caught the person 
    who caught you has to say,"1,2,3,  
    British Bulldogs",and you stay in  
    the middle with the catcher . You  
    then call out somebody's name. If  
    you are not caught and you get into
    the other den it is called         
    "stampede". "Stampede" means all   
    the other people run to the den you
    are in. If the person who is picked
    trips up on his run and is caught  
    it is called a "re_run". A "re_run"
    means the person who was picked has
    to take the run again.
