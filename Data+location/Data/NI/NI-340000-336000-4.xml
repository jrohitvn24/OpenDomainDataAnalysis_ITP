		<content> This saltmarsh includes some other    
 species in small numbers. It provides 
 a good feeding ground for waders and  
 other birds; a kingfisher can         
 occasionally be seen here. The outlet 
 to the sea is a narrow gap (about 3 m 
 wide) in the old railway embankment   
 which cuts it off from the rest of the
 Inner Bay. This embankment is often   
 used by local wildowlers as a high    
 vantage point and hide. This 'ridge'  
 runs the length of the West side of   
 the North Inner Bay and has been      
 adopted as a Nature Reserve by the    
 National Trust. The embankment is     
 still topped with chippings and the   
 development of a vegetation cover has 
 been slow. Nevertheless, the path is  
 rich in primroses in spring, orchids, 
 cuckoo pint, toadflax, white wood     
 vetch, extra-large sloes, early       
 brambles,common reed,biting stonecrop.</content>
