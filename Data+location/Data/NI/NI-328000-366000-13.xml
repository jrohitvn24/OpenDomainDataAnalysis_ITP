		<title>13EMPLOYMENT SURVEY, DUNMURRY</title>
		<content> We took a sample survey of where the  
 people in Dunmurry worked and we      
 discovered that 49% of the sample     
 travelled to Belfast which is 8 km    
 away. Most of this 49% was male and   
 the jobs varied from industrial to    
 professional. We then found that 42%  
 of the sample worked in the village.  
 These were mainly female and their    
 work was in the retail trade and in   
 the care of the elderly. 9% of the    
 sample travelled to other towns for   
 work. These were males working in     
 small industry. It seems that Dunmurry
 is an area of shops employing mostly  
 women but because of good             
 communications with Belfast it is a   
 good commuter area for men working in 
 the city.
