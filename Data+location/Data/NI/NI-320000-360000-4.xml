		<content> The{Long Kesh Meteorological Station} 
 was built twenty three years ago and  
 is situated within the security       
 boundaries of the Maze prison.Visitors
 require a special security clearance  
 before admittance.Twelve "weather men"
 work in the station which is manned 24
 hours a day.The senior meteorological 
 officer is Mr.H.Meeke.                
 As in all stations throughout the     
 world weather balloons,filled with    
 hydrogen are launched at 12 noon and 6
 pm.each day.As it ascends to the      
 troposphere gadgets fixed to the      
 balloon send signals to the stations  
 computer giving precise details of    
 temperature,humidity and air pressure.
 These signals are plotted onto a      
 weather map before being relayed to   
 Bracknell for detailed study.At a     
 height of 11 miles the balloon bursts 
 and the equipment falls into the sea. </content>
