		<title>18SOCIAL CONCERNS DONAGHADEE</title>
		<content> Donaghadee is probably no better and  
 no worse than any other community as  
 regards its concern for the socially  
 deprived or needy.                    
                                       
 In the town are some establishments   
 purpose built for the aged and/or     
 infirm.There are three private nursing
 homes for the elderly, a Health Board 
 Home and sheltered accommodation.     
                                       
 There are two holiday homes for       
 children from disadvantaged           
 backgrounds and a Children's Home.    
                                       
 As in many areas there are problems   
 such as underage drinking and         
 vandalism. The Community Association  
 and others are making strenuous       
 efforts to improve the situation in a 
 positive way.                         
                                       </content>
