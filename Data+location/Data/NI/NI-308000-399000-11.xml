		<content>      In l944 J. Pollock and J.        
 Stevenson agreed to start             
 Ballymena Construction Company. They  
 manufactured bricks and blocks and    
 undertook many small civil            
 engineering contracts.                
      Due to the civil engineering side
 expanding they decided to manufacture 
 concrete ogee pipes and fittings.  Due
 to a shortage of sewerage pipes in    
 N.Ireland they decided to manufacture 
 these as well as the drain pipes.  As 
 a result of this they became the first
 manufacturers of spun concrete pipes  
 in N.Ireland. They are presently in a 
 position to supply various sizes of   
 pipes from 6" to 48" diameter, brick  
 and block, premix, concrete flags  and
 kerbs, roof tiles, all manufactured by
 the most up-to-date machinery. They   
 now employ fifty people and have      
 invested Â£24O,OOO  on machinery.      </content>
