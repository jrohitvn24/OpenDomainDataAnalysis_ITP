		<title>15FARMING: MR A.HUGHES</title>
		<content>{Farming}in this area has moved during 
 20 years from traditional small       
 farming to a{narrow range farm.}The   
 traditional farm had a field of       
 potatoes,a field of corn or barley and
 the rest of the land divided between  
{grazing and haymaking.}The farmer     
 keeps a small herd of 8_10 cows       
 providing the main cash income.The    
 farmer provided mainly by his crops of
 hay,corn and barley food for his      
 cattle .Today there are no small dairy
 herds.Farmers were bought out and     
 only the large dairy farm survives    
 sending milk to{Fane Valley creamery. 
 The farmland in this area is used     
 mainly for grazing and providing      
 silage for winter feeding.A few       
{orchards}are found here as this area  
 is on the edge of the main apple      
 growing centre,{Loughgall.
