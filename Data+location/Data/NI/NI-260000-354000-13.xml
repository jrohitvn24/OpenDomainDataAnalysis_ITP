		<title>13LIFESTYLE IN LISDOART</title>
		<content> We interviewed a number of people     
 living in Lisdoart, one of whom was   
 Mrs. Bridget Pearson. She told us     
 about a typical day living in         
 Lisdoart.                             
    She gets up at half past seven in  
 the morning and wakes up her five     
 children to get ready for school. She 
 makes their breakfast and they go to  
 the end of the road to catch the bus. 
 Some days she goes to Ballygawley to  
 do the shopping as there are no shops 
 in Lisdoart for the rest of the day   
 she tidies the house or washes.       
    Mrs. Pearson has been living in    
 Lisdoart for fifteen years and when   
 asked if she liked it she said "yes,  
 as it is peaceful.", but she did      
 complain about the lack of facilities,
 especially for the children.          
                                       
                                       </content>
