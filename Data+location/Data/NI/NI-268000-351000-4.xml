		<title>04Silage making</title>
		<content>  {Silage}is the main feed for cattle  
 in the winter.  It is grass which is  
 put into a pit.  Next it is heavily   
 rolled and covered with black plastic 
 so that it is air tight.  Next it is  
 left to ferment until needed to feed  
 the cattle.                           
   The grass for silage is cut and     
 chopped by a{forage harvester}drawn by
 a tractor, and blown into a trailer.  
 There is another tractor to take the  
 trailer to the storage pit.  It is    
 then pushed into the pit and rolled to
 exclude all the air.  "Add F" is a    
 chemical put in the silage to sweeten 
 it before it goes into the pit.       
   Some people wilt the grass before   
 they put it into the pit. This means  
 they cut it and leave it for a day    
 before they bring it in. {The silage  
{is used to feed cattle in winter time.
