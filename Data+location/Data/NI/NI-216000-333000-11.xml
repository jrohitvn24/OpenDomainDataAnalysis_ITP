		<title>11UNUSUAL PETS.</title>
		<content>{My gander}is white with a orange beak 
 and orange feet.His name is{Gregory. }
 Daddy won him at Christmas.He was     
 meant to be killed but he was too much
 of a pet.                             
  He has lived at our house for three  
 years now.Sometimes we turn the hose  
 on him he does not like it.He chases  
 the dog,my sisters and me.            
   I have got a{favourite}pet.It is a  
{lamb.}I got it on my birthday.There   
 were three ewes lambing.The other two 
 had lambed and we went up to the last 
 one.She had four lambs and one of them
 was so weak and small that it had to  
 be brought down to the house.The other
 three went into a shed with their     
 mother.The little lamb was so small   
 and helpless that Daddy said if I took
 good care of it he would give it to me
 for my birthday.My lamb is called     
{Stella}after me.She is a big lamb now.</content>
