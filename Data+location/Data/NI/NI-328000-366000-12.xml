		<title>12DELOREAN CAR FACTORY</title>
		<content> In 1978 John Delorean came from       
 America to build a sports car factory 
 in Dunmurry. The cost of construction 
 was estimated at 18 million pounds and
 it was sited in this area of high     
 unemployment. It was hoped that 2000  
 people would be employed. By 198o, 70 
 acres of land had been transformed    
 into a modern car plant. Annual       
 production was targeted at 20 000 or  
 more cars. The car was a distinctive  
 sports car, with stainless steel      
 finish and gull-winged doors. It was  
 to be sold in America. In spite of    
 government help the venture was not a 
 success and the cars are now only     
 collectors' pieces, however attractive
 and futuristic. It was not possible to
 sell enough cars to continue          
 production, and the factory closed.
