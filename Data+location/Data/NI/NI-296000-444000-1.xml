		<title>01The Land Around Dunseverick</title>
		<content> An area incorporating sea, coastline  
 and rural setting. The most northerly 
 point of the North Antrim coastline   
 and cliff path, again part of the     
 Causeway Walk, featuring Benbane Head 
 as the northerly peninsular. The      
 coastline is of great beauty and      
 dramatic scenery, with the Atlantic   
 swell crashing in on the rocks below  
 and a bracing wind on your face when  
 you walk the cliff path. Not as       
 popular to walk as the earlier        
 sections of the Causeway, due to      
 distance and lack of access.          
 The majority of the block is farmland,
 principally for grazing sheep and     
 cattle. There are more settlements and
 therefore denser population. Some     
 fields are cultivated and used to grow
 potatoes and barley. There are more   
 communications in the forms of second 
 class roads.                          </content>
