 Since the closing of the railway,     
 traffic on the roads, particularly    
 heavy freight traffic, has increased  
 dramatically and this has led to great
 wear and tear of the road network.    
 The cost of repairing the roads is    
 very high while at the same time fuel 
 prices are nearly five times as high  
 as they were in the 1960's. All this  
 has put in question the wisdom of the 
 decision to run down the railway      
 system.                               
       In 1984 a new bus depot costing 
 over one million pounds was opened in 
 Dungannon. It is ironic that this new 
 depot is right beside the site of the 
 old railway station. The depot        
 comprises offices, passenger waiting  
 rooms, maintenance garages and a large
 machine for washing the buses.
