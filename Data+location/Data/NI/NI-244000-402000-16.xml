		<content> The Danton family have farmed in the  
 Donemana district for over one hundred
 and sixty years they originally came  
 from France.Mr Danton has over four   
 hundred and forty acres of land.There 
 are four men employed on Mr Dantons   
 farm.His stock of dairy cattle is one 
 hundred and sixty cows. The breed     
 of dairy cattle are Fridsian, (kept on
 his farm).One hundred and twenty beef 
 cattle are reared.Thirty acres of the 
 land are devoted to arable farming.The
 only crop grown on his land is        
 barly.The  major changes in farming   
 over the past thirty years have been  
 a move from mixed farming to          
 specialised dairy and beef production.
 Farming in future will become less    
 intensive due to over productions of  
 most food stuffs in the E.E.C.
