		<content>  There is an ULSTER SOCIETY FOR THE   
 PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS      
 shelter in our area.                  
  It is run by an inspector and he can 
 keep up to forty dogs and cats. The   
 dogs are fed once a day while puppies 
 are fed five times a day.             
  The area covered by this centre takes
 in some sea coast and a large stretch 
 of the river Bann. The inspector in   
 the past therefore has dealt with     
 seals and seagulls suffering from oil 
 pollution. He has also treated swans, 
 repairing the tips of their wings and 
 then returning them to the same       
 environment from whence they came.    
  Badgers caught in snares are another 
 problem. Special tought leather gloves
 have to be worn while freeing them.   
 They are brought to the centre,       
 checked by a vet and then released.
