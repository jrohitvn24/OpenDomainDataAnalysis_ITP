		<title>01A SURVEY IN WEST TYRONE</title>
		<content>  Our block lies between 100 and       
 200 metres above sea level.The land is
 reasonably fertile although all of it 
 is clssified as "less favoured "  by  
 the Department of Agriculture. The    
 land is drained by the{Routingburn    
{river}which flows into the Foyle      
 system.The main{trunk road}from Derry 
 to Dublin crosses the block from the  
 North West to the South East.Farming  
 is the chief industry in the area with
 milk and beef being the main          
 products.Very few{crops}other than    
 grass are grown on the land.Most of   
 the farms are small,about 20 to 25    
 hectares.Dairying is done on the      
 larger farms.In the area there is one 
 intensive poultry farm of 161 000     
 birds producing eggs and chicken meat.
 The district is sparsely populated and
 there are two small primary{schools   
 and one church to serve the area.     </content>
