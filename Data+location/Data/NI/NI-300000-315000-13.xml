		<title>13NEW ROAD</title>
		<content> A big subject for discussion in the   
 area at the present time is the       
 proposed{NEW ROAD}which is to be built
 to improve the flow of heavy traffic  
 on the main{Belfast/Dublin Road}      
 between{Newry}&amp;{Dundalk.              
 It is to be a dual carriageway and the
 proposed route is from{Killeen Bridge}
 on the main Dublin road,along the west
 side of the{Belfast/Dublin}railway    
 line, between{Dromintee School}&amp; the  
 new{Dromintee Gaelic Football Pitch,} 
 to the{Gap of the North}at{Glendooey.}
 People in the area,especially farmers,
 are opposed to this route because of  
 the loss of land or the division of   
 their small holdings.They argue in    
 favour of the other route -the        
 upgrading of the present main{        
{Newry/Dundalk}road                    
    Which route will finally be        
 selected is not yet certain.          </content>
