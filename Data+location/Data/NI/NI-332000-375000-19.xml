		<content>  "Joyriding" is teenagers taking other
 peoples cars and driving them around  
 their district, but some of them crash
 the cars.  Some of them get shot when 
 they try to run down Police or        
 Soldiers.  There's a woman called Mrs 
 Mortiboys whose car has been stolen   
 twice, the first time it was found    
 with Â£250 of damage to the bodywork   
 and engine.                           
 Now we go on to a more happier leaf   
 every year the Lord Mayor of Belfast  
 Mr Alfie Ferguson has a dream machine.
  Every school in Belfast has to send  
 in the best three in every class.Then 
 the Lord Mqyor picks the best dream   
 then invites the child to dinner in   
 the City Hall and then arranges for   
 his or her dream to come true.
