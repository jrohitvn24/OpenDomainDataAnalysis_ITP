		<content>     I live in Rathcoole Estate and    
 during the summer holidays we quite   
 often go to{Hazelbank}_if the weather 
 is good!                              
     Hazelbank is on the shore of      
 Belfast Lough and is about a three    
 kilometre walk from my house.         
     Some friends come to my house and 
 we prepare a picnic and pack our      
 swimming gear into a bag and set off. 
     We walk down through the houses   
 and across the busy Shore Road to     
 Hazelbank. Usually on a good day it is
 quite crowded with some people bowling
 or children playing on the swings and 
 slides.But not many use the little    
 beach where we swim probably because  
 it is very shelly and the water is    
 always cold!                          
     After our swim we eat our picnic  
 and maybe play on the swings or climb 
 the trees. It makes a nice day out.   </content>
