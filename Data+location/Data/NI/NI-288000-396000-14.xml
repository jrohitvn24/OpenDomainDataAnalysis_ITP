		<title>14A Visit to Police Station.</title>
		<content> Constable Clarke came to our school to
 tell us about the police-The Royal    
 Ulster Constabulary. She promised us a
{visit}to the police station. I wanted 
 to see the cells.There were two{guards
 standing inside a big gate. We were on
 T.V.! {Security}cameras covered every 
 area of the station. Three{dogs}- two 
 German Shepherds and a Labrador barked
 at us from their van. The radios,tele-
 phones and teleprinters in the{operat-
{ions room}were all busy.{Maps}covered 
 the  walls. The{operators}were very   
 friendly. The fitness room was great, 
 jogging machines, weight lifting and a
 sauna. The{cells}were not too scary.  
 The guns and ammunition filled the    
 armoury.The briefing room had hundreds
 of{photographs.}The police{car}had    
 thick{armoured}windows and doors. The 
 armoured landrovers were parked neatly
 The{games room}had snooker and darts. </content>
