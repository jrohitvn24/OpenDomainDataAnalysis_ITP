		<title>01GENERAL DESCRIPTION</title>
		<content>    The area you are investigating lies
 just south of the village of Glenavy, 
 with a somewhat larger village,       
 Crumlin, another 3 miles north.       
    A railway line, and an approach    
 road to BELFAST AIRPORT (Aldergrove)  
 run parallel to each other in a       
 north-south direction through the     
 eastern part of the area. These apart,
 it is entirely rural. BELFAST is some 
 15 miles away, and the busy town of   
 LISBURN some 9 miles.                 
    The land is largely GRASSLAND      
 intensively cultivated and fertilised,
 and beef and milk production have for 
 long been the economic mainstay. Milk 
 production has had a setback due to   
 the "milk-lake" in the European       
 Economic Community, and local farmers 
 in 1985 are having to make painful    
 adjustments.             (CONT'D..)
