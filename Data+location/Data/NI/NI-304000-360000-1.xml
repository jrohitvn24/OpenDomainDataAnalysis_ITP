		<title>01Shores of Lough Neagh,Lurgan</title>
		<content>  The area is mainly flat land going   
 from Lurgan down to the shores of     
 Lough Neagh.                          
  The main agricultural activity is    
 beef farming.                         
  There is a wide variety of water     
 sports available in the area.These are
 catered for at Kinnegoe Marina and in 
 the sailing club at Oxford Island,    
 where there is also an extensive      
 nature reserve.                       
  An Industrial Estate at Annesborough 
 provides facilities for a number of   
 factories.                            
  In Castor Bay are the Water Works,   
 where water from the Lough is treated 
 to make it fit for human use.         
  Housing in the area is confined to   
 isolated residences,mainly bungalows, 
 although there are two new estates    
 being developed.
