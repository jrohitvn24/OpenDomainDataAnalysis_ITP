		<title>11PUBLIC TRANSPORT, DUNGANNON</title>
		<content>                                       
 There are thirty buses stationed in   
 Dungannon itself while fifty buses    
 come in from neighbouring towns every 
 day, except Sunday. Weekday services  
 begin at 06.45 and end at 23.10.Many  
 of these are concerned with the       
 transporting of children to school in 
 the town from outside areas.This means
 that peak bus times are from 08.15 to 
 09.15 and 15.00 to 16.30.Bus services 
 on Sunday are limited with only a     
 small number of routes being covered. 
 Operating the bus service during the  
 civil disturbances of the last        
 fifteen years has been extremely      
 difficult. Frequently buses have been 
 hijacked, set on fire and used as     
 barracades during riots. Bus stations 
 have suffered bomb and arson attacks.
