		<title>20FARMING CHANGES</title>
		<content>{FARMING}HASN'T CHANGED MUCH OVER THE  
 YEARS.THE FIELDS HAVEN'T BEEN RESEEDED
 FOR A LONG TIME.MOST OF THE ANIMALS   
 GRAZING ON THE GRASS ARE SHEEP BECAUSE
 THEY CAN LIVE UP ON THE MOUNTAIN      
 BETTER THAN CATTLE. THERE ISN'T MUCH  
 CROP FARMING IN THE AREA BECAUSE THE  
 LAND IS ROCKY,MOSSY AND HILLY.THERE IS
 USUALLY TWO OR THREE FIELDS OF BARLEY 
 OR POTATOES.THE FARMERS USED TO BURN  
 THEIR OWN LIME BUT NOW THEY BUY IT.IN 
 OLDEN DAYS THE FARMERS HADN'T ANY     
 MACHINERY TO WORK THE  LAND BUT NOW   
 THEY HAVE,SO THE WAY OF FARMING HAS   
 CHANGED AND THERE IS LESS LABOURS ON  
 THE FARM.THERE USED TO BE DIFFERENT   
 TYPES OF ANIMALS ON THE FARM LIKE     
 DUCKS,GOATS AND TURKEYS,BUT NOW THERE 
 IS JUST SHEEP AND CATTLE.FARMING      
 MACHINERY  HAS BECOME MORE MODERNISED 
 SO FARMERS DON'T NEED AS MANY WORKERS 
 THIS CAUSES UNEMPLOYMENT DIFFICULTIES.</content>
