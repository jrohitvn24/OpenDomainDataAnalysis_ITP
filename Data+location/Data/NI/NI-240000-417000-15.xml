		<content>{A visit to the fire station.          
                                       
 We decided to call at the local fire  
 station on{Northland Rd.}When we got  
 there,the{Duty Officer}met us and took
 us to the{control room.}He put a test 
 call through for us.{999}calls all go 
 to the Operations Centre in{Lisburn   
 and are then referred to the local    
 station. He showed us the many varied 
 parts of a fire engine and equipment  
 used. When they are going into burning
 buildings they must wear{oxygen masks.
 The Officer took us upstairs and      
 showed us how to{slide down the pole. 
 We went to the{training room}which had
 dummies lying around.The firemen have 
 to rescue these dummies from a dark,  
 hot, smoke filled room.There were many
 obstacles to be surmounted including a
 long tunnel.{It was just like the real
{thing!                                </content>
