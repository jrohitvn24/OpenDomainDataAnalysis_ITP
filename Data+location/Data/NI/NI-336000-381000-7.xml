		<content> wedding receptions, trade shows,      
 conferences and dancing.  The Toners  
 Room (named after a former employee of
 Lord Shaftesbury to whom the house    
 passed) is now the restaurant.  It has
 a little dance floor and can cater for
 90/100 people.  The Eden room upstairs
 holds 50 persons and is used mainly   
 for meetings, conferences and small   
 dinner parties.  Many personalities   
 have stayed at the hotel over the     
 years.  These have included wrestlers 
 such as Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy,
 entertainers like Foster and Allen,   
 Ruby Murray and the Flying Pickets and
 actors such as Chris Quentin of       
 Coronation Street.  Very recently the 
 Israeli Bowling team used the hotel as
 their base and the British            
 Championship for Old English Sheepdogs
 was also held.
