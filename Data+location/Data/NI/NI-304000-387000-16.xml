		<title>16NEW PIER AT CRANFIELD</title>
		<content> CRANFIELD PIER IS BEING ENLARGED SO   
 THAT THE PLEASURE BOAT THE MAID OF    
 ANTRIM CAN DOCK THERE. THERE IS A     
 BREAKWATER AS LONG AS 140 FEET FROM   
 THE LAND AND AS DEEP AS 12 FEET.THERE 
 IS ANOTHER SMALLER BREAKWATER. THE    
 CHANNEL IS BEING DEEPENED ALSO SO THAT
 THE LARGE BOAT WILL NOT SCRATCH HER   
 HULL ON THE BOTTOM.  THE ENTIRE AREA  
 WILL BE LAID OUT IN LAWNS AND CONCRETE
 PATHS AND PICNIC TABLES PROVIDED SO   
 THAT VISITORS WILL ENJOY THEIR VISIT  
 TO THE LOUGH SHORE.                   
                                       
 THE SHELTERED SIDE OF THE BREAKWATER  
 IS CALM AND SAFE AND WILL BE USED FOR 
 SWIMMING AND FISHING.THE MAID OF      
 ANTRIM TAKES VISITORS ON A 2 HOUR TRIP
 ROUND THE LOUGH AND GOES OUT TWICE    
 DAILY IN THE SUMMER SEASON.           
                                       
                                       </content>
