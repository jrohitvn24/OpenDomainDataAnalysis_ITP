		<content> A small reservoir serving Hollywood   
 occupies part of the North-west sector
 while nearer to the town are a golf   
 course and a park. A horse-riding     
 school also is found in the area and  
 with all these amenities there is     
 great scope for leisure activities:   
 walking, riding, golf, fishing in the 
 reservoir. For those interested in    
 natural history there are a variety of
 habitats e.g. streams, hedgerows,     
 parkland, woodland and of course,     
 farmland which is mainly under grass. 
 The little village of Craigantlet lies
 where several roads meet - they are   
 mainly third-class but in parts have  
 been developed because of commuting to
 and from Belfast, mainly by cars      
 although there is a bus service.      
 There is evidence of settlement over a
 long period - a standing stone, a     
 rath, old and stately homes.          </content>
