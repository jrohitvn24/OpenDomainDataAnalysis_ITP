 and the other teaches primary four to 
 primary seven.                        
   The building is a wooden  structre  
 which was built in 1959.There are two 
 classrooms and a dining room,which was
 once used as a classroom one kitchen, 
 six stores, three toilets.There is a  
 partition between our classroom and   
 the dining room.This can be opened to 
 provide a large room.There was a house
 belonging to the school in which the  
 principal lived but now it has been   
 sold and other people are living in   
 it.In our playground we have a very   
 large field and also tarmac.In the    
 kitchen the cooks prepare the meals.  
 The building is heated by the boiler,
