		<content> In Primary Five we continued on with  
 Mental Arithmetic, Tables, English,   
 Reading, Spellings, Geography, History
 and Natural Science.                  
  In Primary Six we continued on with  
 our normal subjects, started project  
 work, joined the School Choir and were
 able to join the Hockey, Football or  
 Badminton Teams. We also started a lot
 of hard work in preparation for the   
 Selection Tests which we do in the    
 Primary Seven year.                   
  In Primary Seven we had to sit two   
 Selection Tests one in October and one
 in November. These tests were given to
 all Primary Seven children throughout 
 Northern Ireland and were used to     
 select the type of Secondary Education
 most suitable for us.During the past  
 five years these changes have taken   
 place - video recorder bought in 1980 
 and computer obtained in 1984.        </content>
