		<title>10NEWTOWNARDS FACTORY PRODUCTS</title>
		<content> Newtownards is basically a market town
 providing facilities for the Ards     
 Peninsula and a dormitory town for    
 Belfast. However, the area is noted   
 for its thriving industries. As there 
 are few factory chimneys, it is hard  
 to realise that there is an active and
 progressive industrial community.     
 Textile industries were developed here
 and this tradition is being carried on
 in a modern way. V.F. Corporation     
 manufacture Lee jeans and leisurewear 
 and the hosiery division produce      
 tights, socks and knitwear. Bairdwear 
 specialise in ladies wear, swimwear   
 and children's wear. Crepe weavers    
 produce fabrics from nylon and        
 polyester filament yarns especially   
 coated fabrics used for sportswear,   
 waterproofed garments and             
 covers.Shorts, the aircraft makers,   
 have a general engineering factory.   </content>
