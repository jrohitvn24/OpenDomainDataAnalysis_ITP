		<content>   There are no painting, poetry or    
 musical societies in Comber but there 
 are many local artists who have great 
 talent.  Their main outlet is{The Mews
{Gallery}in Killinchy Street owned by  
 Mr. Ian Thompson.  He has used the old
 stables at the back of his house to   
 great advantage.                      
   There are two rooms upstairs        
 displaying paintings of landscapes,   
 flowers and wildlife.  The work of    
 local jewellers is displayed in glass 
 boxes holding earrings, bracelets,    
 necklaces and many other shining works
 of art.  There is also a beautiful    
 handmade rocking horse costing Â£395.  
   In the adjoining room you can buy   
 coffee and cakes.  Customers come from
 all over Ulster, along with foreign   
 tourists who like to buy pictures of  
 Irish cottages.  Mr. Thompson says it 
 has all been a great success.         </content>
