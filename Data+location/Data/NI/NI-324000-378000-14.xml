		<content>  Jacqueline attends Loanends Youth    
 Club which meets weekly (fortnightly  
 in the summer). Here she plays games  
 such as snooker, pool and hockey and  
 has taken part in "Superteams", a     
 competition between a number of Youth 
 clubs.                                
  Jacqueline does not have other       
 children living near her home to play 
 with. When at home, she helps around  
 the house or watches TV as well as    
 doing her school work. With this added
 to her other leisure activities, she  
 clearly lives a busy and varied life  
 in the countryside.
