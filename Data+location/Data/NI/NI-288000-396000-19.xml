		<title>19My Mummy's New Kitchen</title>
		<content> This year my mummy decided she would  
 have a{new}kitchen. So all the{old    
 formica cupboards, the sink and the   
 wooden draining boards were{removed.  
 The{larder}too had all the shelves    
 pulled down. One day men arrived to   
{install}the 'new' kitchen. The        
 cupboards were made of{oak}and the    
 bench top was{plastic laminate.}They  
 tiled the walls. Some of the cupboards
 had glass doors where mummy could put 
 some of her nice plates. The sink,made
 of{stainless steel,}had two basins and
 a small one in the centre. There were 
 two taps but only one spout which     
 moved sideways.The cupboard for sauce_
 pans was very different. It slid out  
 as two drawers and they had mesh      
 bottoms. The old electric cooker was  
 sold, a new{high level}electric{oven  
 and a gas{hob}were installed.
