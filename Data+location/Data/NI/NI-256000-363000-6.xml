		<title>06THE BOG IN ALTAMUSKIN</title>
		<content> Gone are the days of winning turf by  
 the laborious hand methods cutting by 
 spade (slean) and barrowing the sods  
 to be spread out. A few still use this
 method, but{the introduction of       
{various turf cutting machinery}has    
 made turf readily and cheaply         
 available to many more people.        
   Those who have turf banks pay a fee 
 to get their turf cut. Outsiders buy  
 ready cut turf on the bank.On a good  
 day the bog is alive with people      
 harvesting their{turf,a cheap year's  
{fuel supply.}Most people find going to
 the bog as an enjoyable outing. Some  
{people earn their living with turf    
 especially families with their own    
 help. They buy plots of turf save it  
 and then sell it to the towndwellers. 
 Unfortunately,the burning of the      
 heather and draining the bogs does    
{harm to wildlife in the area.         </content>
