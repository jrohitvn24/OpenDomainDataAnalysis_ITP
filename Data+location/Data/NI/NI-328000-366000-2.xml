 My name is Helen McCarthy and I live  
 in a semi-detached house in Dunmurry  
 village. There is a lounge, a dining  
 area and a kitchen downstairs.        
 Upstairs there are three bedrooms and 
 a bathroom. I live with my mummy,     
 daddy, and brother David. Daddy gets  
 up at 7.30 a.m. He then washes,       
 dresses and goes to work in his car.  
 My mummy, my brother and then get     
 up. We have breakfast and then leave  
 for schoolat 8.45 a.m. I go to Primary
 School while my nrother goes to       
 nursery school. My mummy works until  
 one o'clock. I come home at three     
 o'clock and do my homework. Then I    
 play with David until half past five  
 when we have tea. After tea I help    
 with the dish washing and then watch  
 television.  I go to bed at nine      
 o'clock.                              </content>
