		<title>08Hill Farm, Black Mountain</title>
		<content>  Charlie's{Hill Farm}of 75 acres is on
 the slopes of the Black Mountain.     
 Originally his land was fenced but    
{vandals}were continually stealing the 
 fences so now he does not replace them
 as wood has become so expensive. The  
 land is mainly rough grazing for his  
 herd of{42 Friesian Crosses and Short 
{Horns. Sheep}were reared here         
 until the 1970's but as the city grew 
 outwards dogs from the newly built    
{housing estates}began worrying them.  
  The farmer rises every morning at    
 06.30 and tends the cows. He leaves   
 the milk tank on the roadside where   
 it is collected by the{Milk Marketing 
{Board,}then goes home and has         
 breakfast. After that he sterilises   
 the milking equipment.The cows are    
 milked again at 17.00. After having   
 sterilised his dairy equipment,once   
 more his long hard day ends at 20.00. </content>
