		<content> Each unit usually belongs to one      
 family; often for many generations;   
 but may be only a part-time job, the  
 farmer also being a jobbing builder,  
 school bus driver, etc.               
 A few 'farms' have the farmhouse just 
 as a dwelling house and the associated
 land rented out to neighbouring farms 
 (a system known as conacre).          
 Recent EEC grants have encouraged many
 of these upland farmers to clear,     
 drain, fence and fertilise their      
 higher fields (not hill land). These  
 fields may have lain as rough pasture 
 since their virtual abandonment after 
 the Famine. They are now being        
 reclaimed but are likely to require   
 large inputs of fertiliser to keep    
 them much more productive than they   
 were.                                 
 Each farm may also fatten a few young 
 beef cattle and may grow some fodder. </content>
