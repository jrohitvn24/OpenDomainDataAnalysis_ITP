		<title>19ARDBOE.FEARS FOR THE FUTURE.</title>
		<content>{"Everybody's got a place,where they   
{set their mind at ease,               
{Mine is Ardboe's ancient cross,with   
{the lough's so gentle breeze.         
{And as I did frequent this            
{place,which means so much to me,      
{It was then I started wondering,what  
{the future was to be."                
   The author then goes on to mention  
 all the places where he grew up,places
 which would be wiped out.He asks where
 the fishermen and farmers are going to
 go,likewise the animal life.He        
 concludes with a plea to the planners 
 and others to think again before a    
 community is destroyed.               
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       </content>
