		<content>  This rural area contains medium sized
 fields  of  improved grassland bounded
 mainly  by  hawthorn   hedges  studded
 with  deciduous  trees e.g. beech,ash.
 Throughout  the  year it is frequented
 by  birds  such as meadow pipits,rooks
 and  blackbird .  In  winter  they are
 joined   by   fieldfares    and    the
 occasional hen harrier  and  peregrine
 falcon.Tildarg dam is the  only  large
 body  of  water -  in   summer   sedge
 warblers,{REDSHANK}and{TEAL}breed here
 while in water whooper swans stay  for
 short periods. Otter,badger, hare  and
{FOX}also live here.Recently  there has
 been  damage  to  some  of  the damper
 meadows.  This    has    caused    the
 disappearance   of  rushes  in certain
 areas  and  it  is  quite  likely that
 breeding  birds  such  as  curlew  and
 snipe may decline in  numbers  due  to
 the changing{ECOLOGY }of the area.    </content>
