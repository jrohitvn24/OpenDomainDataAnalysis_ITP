		<content>    My daddy is  a{dairy farmer }up the
 Seskin Road.  He milks one hundred and
 four  cows.  Daddy has two dogs called
 Rex  and  Nick.  On the 5th June daddy
 started   lifting{  silage}  from   Mr
 McKinstry's land on the Ballynure Road
 going  into  Ballyclare.  Mr Mills  is
{helping}daddy by carting up silage for
 him  in the six ninety.  Mr Mills  has
 two  boys  who  go  to  Straid School.
 Graham Armstrong is helping to cart as
 well.  Graham lives in Straid village.
 Bertie  McDowell  is  helping  to,  he
 lived  on a farm once but now he lives
 in  Ballyclare.   Daddy  has  cut  the
 front field down which is three and  a
 half acres.   Daddy is hoping tomorrow
 stays {dry} so  that  he  can draw the
 silage in.  He  has 50 acres of silage
 to make.
