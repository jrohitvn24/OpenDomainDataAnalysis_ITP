		<title>14ROARING HUGH</title>
		<content> The Rev. Dr. Hugh Hanna, who died in  
 February 1892, was a fiery preacher   
 with conservative views who was known 
 to all as Roaring Hugh.  He was       
 responsible for the founding of       
 St.Enoch's Church in Carlisle Circus, 
 and made his re-appearance opposite   
 the church a year after his death,    
 this time in stone. He stayed quietly 
 watching over his church until March  
 1970 when his peace was rudely        
 shattered by a small bomb which blew  
 him off his pedestal.                 
   Although the statue wasn't badly    
 damaged it has been difficult to find 
 out what has happened to it.          
 Soon after hitting the cobbles it was 
 moved to the backyard of a local      
 police station.  A year later it was  
 in a City Council store yard, having  
 been to England to get its feet       
 repaired.                             </content>
