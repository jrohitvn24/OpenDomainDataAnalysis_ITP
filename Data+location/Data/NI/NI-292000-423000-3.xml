 Ballymoney varies between families;   
 the size of the families is decreasing
 with an increasing divorcerate.The    
 housewife's life has become easier    
 with the introduction of new domestic 
 appliances.Most homes have three{meals
 per day, breakfast, consisting of a   
 cereal, with toast and tea, however an
 important exception is the Ulster Fry.
 Generally everyone has a light lunch  
 with the main meal of the day being in
 the early evening. The most important 
 meal of the week is Sunday lunch, when
 all the{family}meets together.        
           In the{rural}areas the      
 predominant domestic animal is the dog
 which sometimes has a working         
 function. Cats are also very popular  
 particularly in the residential areas.
