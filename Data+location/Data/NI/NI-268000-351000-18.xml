		<title>18A farm child's day</title>
		<content>   During a typical week work never    
 goes scarce.  Most farm children have 
 to do a share of the work.            
{  Saturday is usually the busiest day 
{as there is no school. }They have to  
 feed calves in the morning and        
 evening.  The calves are held in      
 various outhouses on the farm.  They  
 also{require hay, meal, milk or water.
{Their houses also have to be cleaned  
{and bedded with dry straw so they can 
{have a dry place to lie during the    
{night.  The small calves get cow's    
{milk to drink but the older calves get
{a powdered milk mixed with water as a 
{drink.                                
   Some animals are on land that is    
 further away from the main farmyard,  
 some of which may be rented from other
 farmers in the area.
