 THE DITCH WAS TO PROTECT THE CHIEF    
 FROM ENEMIES AND WILD ANIMALS (WOLVES)
 THE WHOLE AREA WOULD HAVE BEEN ROOFED 
 OVER TO BUILD A LARGE LOW CIRCULAR    
 HOUSE LIKE A GREAT MUSHROOM WITH NO   
 STALK WITH THE ANIMALS AND THE FAMILY 
 LIVING TOGETHER UNDER THE SAME ROOF.  
  WHEAT WAS GROWN BUT THE              
 MAIN FARMING WOULD HARE BEEN REARING  
 CATTLE. THEY WERE EXPERTS IN CARPENTRY
 AND WOOD LURNING. MANY BEAUTIFUL      
 TURNED BOWLS HAVE BEEN FOUND.         
 STAVE_BUCKETS WERE USED AND CHURNS    
 MADE OF OAK STAVES AND BOUND WITH IRON
 HAVE BEEN FOUND AT HISSUE LISBURN. THE
 VIKINGS (FIRST ATTACK ON LAMBAY ISLAND
 0795) TOOK OVER THIS FORT AND USED IT 
 AS A BASE TO RAID THE SURROUNDING     
 COUNTRYSIDE.                          </content>
