 Our area is sparsly populated. Only   
 around the Crossways at Raloo and in  
 Glenoe village are there many houses  
 close together. We have tried to      
 discover the occupations of the people
 who live in our area.                 
 We have farmers who live and work on  
 their own land. We have teachers who  
 live in our area and work in Larne, we
 have builders and policemen. We have  
 coal men, milk men and a lorry driver 
 working in our area. There is a       
 minister and a business man, there are
 a lot of housewives, there is a       
 professional golfer and a council     
 worker. There is a vet and a nurse, a 
 painetr and a carpenter and a joiner. 
 There is also a waitress and a        
 caretaker.
