		<title>12FARMING</title>
		<content> I live on a farming district about one
 and a half miles out of the village of
 Hilltown.The farms are all small      
 between twenty and one hundred        
 acres,and the main items on them are  
 cattle or sheep.Most of the land is   
 kept for grazing apart from some      
 hay,silage and barley to winter the   
 stock.The cattle are sold in the local
 sale yard in Hilltown.The sheep are   
 mainly Mourne Blackface because they  
 are hardy and can stand the hardship  
 of the cold winters we get on the     
 hilland.Then most of the lambs are    
 sold as store lambs except for some   
 ewe lambs that are kept for extending 
 stock.The farmers get subsites on the 
 cattle and sheep, for manure and      
 fencing and for draining the          
 land.Nearby everybody that farms in   
 this district owns sheep and cattle
