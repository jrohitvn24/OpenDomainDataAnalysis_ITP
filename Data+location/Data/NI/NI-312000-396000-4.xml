		<title>04My Mum's Spare Time</title>
		<content> My mum watches television in her spare
 time on a Sunday because she only     
 makes  dinner and goes to church.Then 
 we go for a walk or a ride on the     
 bikes or dad takes David and me to    
 Island Magee, and mum stays to watch  
 television. Her favourite programmes  
 are  "Dallas" and  "Miss Marples" and 
 other detective stories.She doesn't   
 like "Coronation St.",Boxing and      
 Wrestling programmes because she      
 thinks it's cruel to stand and hammer 
 and throw each other about.She likes  
 to watch a film first on Sunday then  
 Micheal Crawford acting as Frank      
 Spencer.Then she goes to make the tea.
 When we finish our tea we watch       
 "Sorry!" then we watch "The Murder She
 Wrote."We have our supper then we     
 watch "Thats Life."
