		<title>20Mummy's New Kitchen  (cont)</title>
		<content> The{washing machine}was put out into  
 the old larder which is now called the
{utility room.}We had a new one of     
 these too, all mummy has to do is put 
 in the clothes, press a button and    
 they are washed and dried all on their
 own. Mummy also had a{microwave oven  
 installed. This cooks meals very      
 quickly even if the food comes deep   
 frozen from the{freezer.}The freezer  
 is in the utility room. Mummy freezes 
 vegetables and fruit from the garden. 
 When she has time she{bakes}pies and  
 cakes and puts them in it.  One day   
 daddy bought a whole lamb. They had to
 cut it up and put it into bags for    
 storage in the freezer. Mummy has lots
 of other{electric machines}in the     
 kitchen: there is a dishwasher under  
 one side of the sink, a food mixer    
 with attachments,carving knife,toaster
 blender,liquidiser,coffee percolator..</content>
