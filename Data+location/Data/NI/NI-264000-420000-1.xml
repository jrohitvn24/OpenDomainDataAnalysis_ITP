    Limavady is a large country town   
with a population of around 9000 which 
is still growing. The town was         
originally a small market town and a   
market has been held in the town each  
Monday continually from the 17th       
century. It serves as a residential,   
shopping, administrative, educational  
and recreational centre for the area.  
    There are many modern schools, a   
Grammar, two High Schoools, a          
Techinical College, a Special School   
and three Primary Schools within the   
town.                                  
    Employment is mainly in the service
industries but large numbers work in   
the manufacture of synthetic fibres,   
the production of ladies wear and in   
light engineering.
