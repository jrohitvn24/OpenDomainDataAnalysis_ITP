		<title>18The Placename Enniskillen</title>
		<content>   The name 'Enniskillen' comes from   
 the Irish Inis Ceithleann which means 
 'The island of Cathleen'              
   According to legend Ceithleann was a
 queen among fierce pirates who held   
 land in Fermanagh thousands of years  
 ago.                                  
   Their king was Balor of the Mighty  
 Blows &amp; Ceithleann was his wife.      
   In her last battle Ceithleann,      
 killed the enemy king but during the  
 fight she was badly wounded. After the
 battle she managed to struggle as far 
 as the river Erne.                    
   When she got their she saw two      
 islands in the river one large &amp; one  
 small she had just enough strength to 
 swim to the smaller one.There she     
 collapsed &amp; died &amp; when her people    
 found her they buried her on the      
 island  where she lay from that day.  
 The island is called after Ceithleann.</content>
