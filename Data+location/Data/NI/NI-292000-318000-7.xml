		<content> I get up about 8a.m.get washed and    
 dressed and come down to breakfast.I  
 then help to get my little brother    
 dressed and I play with him until it  
 is time to go to school. I board the  
 bus just outside my house and arrive  
 in school about 9.2o am.As soon as I  
 return from school I change my clothes
 do my homework &amp; go outside to help my
 father on the farm.I help him to feed 
 the calves and the hens.I collect the 
 eggs for my mother.I then bring the   
 cows in for milking.While Daddy is    
 milking, I go inside to watch         
 television or play with my racing cars
 or video games.Sometimes I go to my   
 friend's house to play football or    
 snooker.We usually have our evening   
 meal around 8pm.Afterwards we play    
 cards or a game of draughts and then  
 night prayers are said and we go to   
 bed at 10pm.   Sean Garvey.  11yrs.   </content>
