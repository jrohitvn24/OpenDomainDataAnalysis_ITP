		<content> Also in the area there two other      
 schools:                              
 _Kircubbin Primary School which has 55
 pupils and three teachers.            
 At Rubane there is the De La Salle    
 special school which caters for       
 orphans and teenagers from a deprived 
 social background. Current rumours are
 that this school will close before the
 end of this year - 1985.              
                                       
 The divided nature of our province    
 greatly affects the education system. 
 Most children under 16 years of age   
 living in this area attend schools    
 organized by the Roman Catholic Church
 i.e. St. Mary's Primary School in     
 Kircubbin, St. Columba's Secondary in 
 Portaferry and various Grammar schools
 in Belfast. There are no R.C. schools 
 within this grid.
