     This area typifies twentieth      
 century rural Ireland,mixing the old  
 and the new which at the moment don't 
 appear to blend too easily.  It is an 
 area of scenic beauty bisected by a   
 stretch of Newry Canal but somewhat   
 marred by the development of private  
 housing.  This locality has a marked  
 lack of amenities for which the       
 population depend  on surrounding     
 towns.  Although picturesque the land 
 is of poor agricultural potential and 
 few make a living from it, those who  
 do engage in sheep farming.  Two      
 railway lines transverse the area, one
 used, the other disused.  The former  
 goes straight through as there is no  
 station.  The religion of this        
 locality is almost 100% Roman Catholic
 and there is only one church and      
 graveyard to cater for the district.  </content>
