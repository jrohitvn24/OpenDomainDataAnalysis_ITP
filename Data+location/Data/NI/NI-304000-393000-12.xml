		<content> The Parent Teachers Associaion has    
 recently raised money for some badly  
 needed equipment, by organising events
 such as a treasure hunt,beetle drive  
 bring and buy sale and a film show.   
 Some of the items bought include:     
{ Colour television  (Â£150)            
{ Cups &amp; saucers     (Â£ 57)            
{ Photocopier        (Â£499)            
 The headmaster and teachers are       
 convinced that Groggan's prospects for
 the future are bright,with computers  
 being introduced,and used extensively,
 in line with trends generally in      
 education. They also foresee an even  
 greater involvement in both local     
 outings and foreign travel,similar to 
 the 6 day trip to Holland in April,and
 perhaps even a situation where the    
 pupils themselves may be given some   
 say in how{their}school should be run.
