		<content> In the early 1980's it was reckoned   
 that about 20% of the population of   
 Belfast was aged 60 or over. For many 
 years the housing authorities have    
 been working hard tackling the housing
 problems of the city. One of the main 
 problems was to provide housing for   
 senior citizens.The Belgravia Hotel on
 the Lisburn Road had been home for    
 some elderly folk who did not want to 
 live on their own. After a terrorist  
 bomb the building had to be           
 demolished. It was then that the      
 Northern Ireland Housing Association  
 decided to use the site for a complex 
 of self-contained flats for senior    
 citizens. In May,1985 'The Belgravia' 
 was officially opened, providing a    
 beautiful home for 75 people. When we 
 visited the home they all said they   
 were very happy to have such a lovely 
 place to live in their old age.       </content>
