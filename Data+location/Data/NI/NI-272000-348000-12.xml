		<title>12INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH</title>
		<content> Inside the church is a T-shape and    
 there are 54 seats,each seating 6/7   
 people.They are made of pine wood.Each
 family has their own seat,which is en_
 closed by a door.The rectangular      
 pulpit is big,and it has an           
 embroidered{burning bush}draped over  
 the edge.The pulpit is against the    
 wall and is in the middle of the      
 T_shape.There are stairs up to it.It  
 is well situated,so that everyone can 
 see and hear the minister.To the right
 of the pulpit there is the organ,     
 which eas presented to the church by  
 the Reid family in memory of their    
 parents.The organist is Elsie         
 Anderson.There ia another organ at the
 other end of the church.It is         
 beautifully carved and decorated and  
 looks very attractive, but it is more 
 difficult to play,as it has to be     
 pedalled.                             </content>
