		<title>15SIXMILE VALLEY MILLS-HISTORY</title>
		<content>    There  were a number of industries 
 of various  forms in this area during 
 the 19th  century. They  were  mainly 
 associated  with linen, but there was 
 also a corn and a cotton mill.        
    The siting of the mills was due to 
 the  availability of water to provide 
 power.The{Ballynure Water}was used by 
 the{flax  beetling, corn  and  cotton 
 mills. This  river  flows  on to join 
 the{Sixmile  Water }which  is used at 
 Whitepark in a large beetling mill.   
    The{cotton mill}was  a large  five 
 storey building built in 1822  and at 
 its peak employed 200 people. It  was 
 closed  in  the  1860's  when  cotton 
 became unobtainable  due to the{Civil 
{War in America.                       
    With  the  introduction of man-made
 fibres, the linen industry disappeared
 but flax is being grown near Ballynure
 for the first time in many years.     </content>
