		<content> BELLEEK MART IS IN THE MIDDLE OF      
 BELLEEK STREET AND WAS OWNED BY TOMMY 
 DALY WHO OWNED A PUBLIC HOUSE BESIDE  
 THE MART.ANIMALS USED TO BE SOLD ON   
 THE STREET BEFORE THE MART WAS BUILT  
 THE LAST MART ON THE STREET WAS HELD  
 IN OCTOBER 1960. THE NEW MART WAS     
 PAID FOR BY A COLLECTION AMONG THE    
 FARMERS.TOMMY DALY AND THE COMMITTEE  
 BUILT IT WITH THE MONEY THE FARMERS   
 COLLECTED.IT IS BUILT IN TWO SECTIONS,
 ONE IS FOR THE BULLS AND ONE IS FOR   
 THE HEIFERS.THE AUCTIONEER IS JOHN    
 CORRIGAN.THE MART SELLS MOST IN THE   
 AUTUMN BECAUSE OF THE CALF SALES.THE  
 BIG FARMERS DON'T SELL ALL YEAR ROUND 
 BECAUSE THEY GET BETTER PRICES IN     
 ENNISKILLEN WHICH IS TWENTY_FIVE MILES
 AWAY.BELLEEK MART IS VERY NOISY DURING
 THE CALF SALES BECAUSE THE CALVES ARE 
 BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR MOTHERS.  
 IT IS VERY SMELLY ALSO.               </content>
