		<content>   The Highland cattle have been part  
 of Mr.M's farm for over a year.He has 
 three Highland heifers and one newborn
 bull,the first of its kind in Ireland 
 within living memory.                 
   The cattle's coats are reddish-brown
 and very shaggy.There are two         
 coats,the top one which is long hair, 
 and underneath a second downy coat    
 which protects the cow during bad     
 weather so that it can remain outside 
 all the year round.                   
   The animals also have very widely   
 spread horns,which,because they are a 
 rare breed,do not have to be removed. 
    The cattle can live for up to 13   
 years.
