		<title>07LOCAL ELECTIONS AT LOANENDS</title>
		<content>  On May 16th,1985, Loanends Primary   
 School was,for the first time ever,   
 used as a Polling station for the     
 Local Government elections.The station
 opened at 7.00am and closed fifteen   
 hours later at 10.00pm.               
  The voting system was Proportional   
 Representation,whereby voters list the
 candidates in order of preference.This
 was the first occasion in the United  
 Kingdom where voters were required to 
 produce proof of identification before
 being allowed to vote.                
  Out of a total electorate of 10,285  
 in Antrim-S.E.there were 6,051 valid  
 votes.The eleven candidates who stood 
 for election were contesting 7 seats  
 on Antrim District Council which has  
 a total of 19 seats.                  
  Antrim's civic message in a school   
 competition this year was ANTRIM'S WAY
 AHEAD_we hope it is still is.         </content>
