		<title>19School "House" system.</title>
		<content> In our school we have a house system. 
 All the pupils of the school are put  
 into 4 houses - Breifne, Oriel, Tara  
 and Slane. Each house has a house     
 master or mistress. They also have a  
 house captain - a senior pupil at the 
 school.                               
    House points are awarded for       
 various reasons, sporting activities, 
 exams, good behaviour and sometimes   
 during the year they are awarded for  
 special activities. Last year tokens  
 from "Golden Wonder" crisps were      
 collected. For every 10 of these      
 brought in 1 house point was awarded. 
 This encouraged pupils to bring in    
 tokens. As a result of this our school
 was able to send for a game of Unihoc,
 a computer and a "hifi" system using  
 the tokens.                           
     On Wednesday afternoons games are 
 played for house points.              </content>
