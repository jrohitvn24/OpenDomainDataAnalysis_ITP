		<content> In June every year from the area go to
 a garden fete in Donemana.We have a   
 fancy dress party where the children  
 dress up as different people.The      
 winner get prizes.                    
  Every year on 12th July most people  
 from the area go to a large parade.   
 There are lots of bands such as a     
 flute bands ,brass bands,pipe bands   
 and accordian bands.                  
  At Hallowe'en the children make      
 turnip lanterns and play games .We    
 hang an apple on a piece of string    
 and try to get a bite.When we are     
 tired playing this game we play       
 another game where we put coins and   
 bits of apple in a basin full of water
 and we have to duck into the water and
 try to get money or fruit.This is good
 fun as every-one gets wet             
 .
