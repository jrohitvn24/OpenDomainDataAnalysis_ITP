		<title>19THE LEISURE SURVEY 41-60</title>
		<content>    In the 41-60 age group they liked  
 doing things in their spare time which
 were quite energetic.  They were:-    
 gardening, painting, walking,         
 repairing cars, squash, badminton,    
 swimming, bowls, knitting, music      
 concerts and reading.                 
    Some of the ladies in this age     
 group went to a local club.  The one  
 they go to is the Women's Institute.  
    We had to find out whether or not  
 they wanted a leisure centre.  Most   
 people would like one and the         
 reasons were:- it is needed because   
 the population is increasing and the  
 community - for all age groups and the
 unemployed.  One person did not want  
 one as he thought it might bring      
 trouble.                              
    The leisure facilities they would  
 like to see are; swimming pool,       
 athletics, badminton and squash.      </content>
