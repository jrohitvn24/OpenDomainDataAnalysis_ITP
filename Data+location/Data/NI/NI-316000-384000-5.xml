		<content> The housing in the block falls into   
 four categories. (a) Large Housing    
 Executive Estates, (b) Private Housing
 Developments _ Detached and           
 Semi_Detached, (c) Larger detached    
 private houses in their own grounds   
 and, (d) Farm houses.                 
 Those people living in privately owned
 houses are employed in Farming,       
 Administration, Supervisory,          
 Inspectional, and Professionally      
 qualified occupations, and are content
 with their homes and pleasant         
 surroundings.  Many moved to the area 
 because of the employment prospects in
 Antrim in the early l970's.           
 In Public Estates the tenants{        
{attitudes}suggest they are unhappy    
 with the estates controlling body,    
 in dealing with complaints about home 
 maintenance and about tidiness in the 
 estates.                              </content>
