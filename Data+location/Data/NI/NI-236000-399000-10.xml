		<content> Holy Hill Estate-'An employee         
                   remembers.'         
 As part of our study of Holy Hill     
 Estate, near Artigarvan, we           
 interviewed a former employee, who    
 worked as a chauffeur, on the Estate  
 from 1941 to 1983.                    
 Below is a list of some of the points 
 which he told us about working for the
 landed gentry :-                      
 Indoor staff started work at 7.3O am  
 and finished at 8.45 pm.              
 Paraffin lamps were used to light the 
 entire house.                         
 The family had two cars, for which he 
 was responsible for driving and       
 maintaining.                          
 He wore a uniform and received payment
 of Â£1.OO per week in 1941.            
 His hours were uncertain, depending on
 functions and outings.                
 Each Christmas he received a bonus.   </content>
