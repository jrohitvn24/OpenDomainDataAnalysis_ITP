		<title>02SIX FARMS NEAR LIMAVADY I</title>
		<content> SOME FACTS ABOUT THE FARMS WE SURVEYED
 1  Farm sizes ranged from{64 to 600   
{acres}(Average = 290 acres).  This is 
 much larger than normal in N Ireland. 
 2  80% of the farmers' incomes is from
{crops,}and 20% is from sheep and beef 
 cattle; this is also very unusual for 
 N Ireland.                            
 3  The farms are highly mechanised -  
 the machinery on one farm cost        
 Â£120,000.  As a result one man can    
 farm up to 300 acres, and most of the 
 farms are worked by the farmer alone. 
 Extra workers are only employed at    
 harvest time.                         
 4 {Land use}is as follows:            
    Barley 26%   Wheat 24%  Peas 4%    
    Oil Seed Rape 18%   Potatoes 16%   
    Flax 1%   Oats 1%   Grass for      
    grazing and silage 10%             
                                       
                                       </content>
