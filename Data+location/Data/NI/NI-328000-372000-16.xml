		<content> In 1872 the first{horse tram}operated 
 in Belfast, this was followed in 1905 
 by the first{electric tram}service.   
 1926 saw the first{omnibus}and it was 
 succeeded in 1938 by the{trolley bus  
 which was withdrawn in 1968.  The     
 whole area was now served by petrol   
 engined buses, however, due to        
 frequent rioting after 1969{the bus   
{service became erratic.} The buses    
 were targets for hijacking and were   
 taken off the routes and so the{Black 
{Taxi service}came into being- to serve
 the people of the{Falls Road.} The    
 taxis are bought in London, and       
 now in 1985 they are more popular than
 the buses. The fare is cheaper - 30p  
 per adult compared with 40p on the    
 bus.  The black taxis employ 250      
 people and operate from 6 am until 2  
 am the next day - a better service    
 than the bus.                         </content>
