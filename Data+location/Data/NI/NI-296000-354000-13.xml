		<title>13MARKET GARDENING (page 2)</title>
		<content>   The vegetables and fruit are sold   
 fresh to the shops in town where they 
 find a ready market. Some may be sold 
 at the gate of the farm,and it is     
 common to see a "POTATOES FOR SALE" or
 "STRAWBERRIES FOR SALE" sign,or       
 perhaps a table displaying the        
 produce,a list of the prices and a box
 for payment,so you serve yourself.    
 An attractive venture in the area is a
 "Pick your own" soft-fruit farm with  
 strawberries,raspberries,blackcurrants
 redcurrants and gooseberries for sale.
 This 16-acre expanse of fruit lies on 
 a sunny slope about 3 miles from      
 Portadown and is popular with the     
 customers who pick as they wish,with  
 children who can earn some pocket-    
 money,and with families who make the  
 picking part of an outing.
