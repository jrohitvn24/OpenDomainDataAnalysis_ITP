 only school in our immediate area. It 
 is situated on the Lylehill Rd. and is
 No. 78. It is very small and has now  
 been closed. This is a country school 
 and has six classrooms.The age of the 
 school is in the region of three      
 hundred years and is now used as a    
 meeting place by the farmers.         
  Although the school was origionally  
 made of stone it's exterior is now{   
{pebbledash}.                          
  "{Walkers}"is the name of one        
 Roughfort's Pubs.It is located behind 
 the off license called "{Stores}".    
 This pub has a very dull appearance   
 because it has barbed wire and a      
 guard-dog.This is for security        
 reasons.Other pubs in the area are{   
{ The Cottonmount Arms,  The Roughfort 
{Lounge }&amp; a {Working Mans Club.
