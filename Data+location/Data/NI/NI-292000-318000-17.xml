		<title>17Cures in Cullyhanna,contd.</title>
		<content> The wearing of a garment given by a   
 godparent was another and the drinking
 of milk which had been tasted by a    
 ferret was still another! The cure for
 mumps was amusing.One was fitted with 
 an ass's harness,made to crawl under  
 the donkey's belly three times and    
 then driven into a pig-sty,while the  
 one making the cure said a prayer     
 in Irish."Goose-ame,"(unrendered goose
 fat) is still regarded unequalled for 
 massaging a sprain or an aching joint.
 A cobweb taken from behind a picture  
 was once used to stop a bleeding cut. 
 There is a cure,too,for a sore mouth. 
 A person who had never seen his father
 _ being born after his death _ could  
 cure this,by blowing his breath three 
 times into the mouth of the one       
 suffering and saying a prayer.The     
 patient had to have faith in these    
 cures and was not to attend a doctor. </content>
