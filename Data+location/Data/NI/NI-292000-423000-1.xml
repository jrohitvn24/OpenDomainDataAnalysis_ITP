		<title>01BALLYMONEY AND AREA</title>
		<content> Ballymoney is a rural town surrounded 
 by a rich agricultural hinterland. The
 town itself has long narrow streets   
 and a bustling main street. The people
 are very friendly. Most activities and
 clubs are attached to local churches. 
 Recently a few factories have opened  
 in the town giving more employment but
 many people have to travel to nearby  
 towns to work.                        
             {Market day}provides a    
 good meeting time for farmers and many
 of them share a drink or lunch after  
 their business is complete. Ballymoney
 is influenced by the nearby {North    
{Antrim Coast}with its wide variety of 
 scenic tourist attractions.The town   
 could be said to have the best of both
 worlds-rural and coastal. The         
 relatively new bypass means less      
 traffic but has not harmed trade.
