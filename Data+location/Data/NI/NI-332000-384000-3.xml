		<content> There are two {Nursery}and four{      
{Primary}schools in the area serving   
 the educational needs of children in  
 the 3 to 11 age range.                
 The two {Nursery}schools are modern,  
 purpose built units, one situated at  
 Mossley and the other at              
 Monkstown.They offer a wide variety of
 play facilities for the pre-school    
 child and are staffed by specially    
 trained teachers,who help prepare the 
 children for the transition to Primary
 School.                               
 Of the four{Primary} schools, three   
 are controlled(totally funded from    
 Government sources)while              
 one,St.McNissi's is maintained        
 (partially funded by the Roman        
 Catholic Church).When the children    
 reach Primary 7 they go through a     
 transfer procedure including the 11+  
 examination for Secondary School.     </content>
