 in 1974.They are always held on the   
 last Friday and Saturday in April.They
 are sponsored by Insurance Brokers    
 called Sumner + Mc Millen and it is   
 not an international competion.It is  
 up to the staff of Sumner and McMillen
 to set up the jumps each year.The     
 Rademon Horse Trials were started to  
 promote good horseman-ship.Jessica    
 Harrington is one famous person who   
 has been here.In 1985 there were 145  
 entries.There are 28 fences.The most  
 difficult would be the river because  
 some horses do not like water.
