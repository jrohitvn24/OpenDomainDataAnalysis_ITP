		<content>   In the Cookstown area main roads    
 have been straightened and widened and
 are free from pot-holes.The Moneymore 
 Road has a dual carriageway from the  
 outskirts of the town to              
 Moneymore.There is a great deal of    
 through traffic using this route and  
 it is very convenient.                
   Second and third class country roads
 are much narrower than the main       
 roads.They are badly maintained having
 many pot-holes.There are many         
 dangerous bends and this is not helped
 by the growth of tall weeds and       
 hedgerows which are not cut regularly.
   In the town centre the conjestion of
 traffic has been greatly alleviated by
 the erection of traffic lights at the 
 junction of Molesworth Street and     
 James Street in the latter  part of   
 1984.More traffic lights and          
 pedestrian crossings are required.    </content>
