 HAVE                                  
 A FINE EXAMPLE OF A CHIEFTIAN'S THREE 
 RINGED FORTRESS OF THE EARLY CHRISTIAN
 PERIOD.THIS WAS A PLACE WHERE EARLY   
 IRISH FARMERS LIVED. THEY KEPT CATTLE 
 AND BUILT BANKS OFEARTH TO KEEP THE   
 CATTLE IN AND THEY ALSO HELPED TO     
 PROTECT THE PEOPLE. THIS IS ALSO WHY  
 IT WAS BUILT ON A HILL_TOP.THESE FORTS
 WERE USED DURING TIMES OF TROUBLE IN  
 THE IRON AGE(7TH CENTURY B.C.) FROM   
 THE TIME OF CHRIST'S BIRTH THE        
 IRISH CHIEFTAINS LIVED HERE. THE LAW  
 OF THE TIME SAID THAT A KING MUST A   
 DOUBLE BANK OR MOUND AROUND HIS HOUSE.
 THIS WAS THE HOME OF RICH PEOPLE      
 THERE WERE MANY SLAVES, WORKMEN AND   
 PEOPLE WITH LITTLE LAND WHO LIVED IN  
 SMALL SIMPLE HOUSES.
