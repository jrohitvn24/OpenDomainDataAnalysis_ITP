The area we studied is very typical with its many{{apple orchards}-over 30,in fact. Apple production does not consist only ofharvesting;it involves year-roundwork.There are FOUR stages - {PRUNING.}This is done during the ""dormant"" season-December,January andFebruary.

A chemical spray programme is required to control the major apple diseases of mildew and scab _the latter causing black spots on the apples. Spraying is also used to kill off apple pests such asgreenfly,red spider and caterpillar.{{HARVESTING }This stage usually beginsin August with the ripening of the ""Grenadier"" crop (cooking apples),butthe main crop,the ""Bramley Seedling"",is normally pulled at the end of October.

Barley straw has also beenscarce as the farmers have been luckyto get the grain off the fields. Manyfarmers have changed to bagged silagemaking this year. This requires less capital outlay than a silage tower and the large black polythene bags ofsilage are simply left in the fields and opened whenever needed.

A kindle is a computerized book. It can store over one thousands books. You download the books from the internet at a cost. You have to buy the books of the ""bookstore"", an online shop. It has to be a book that has already been written. You can get all different colours of kindle - white and black.<br /><br />Over the years the computers we use in school have really changed.In 1986 the school only had a couple of BBC computers. Nowadays we have PCs and laptops in every room.<br /><br />The laptop is an electrical portable device that is used for storing information (just like the old computers).It is useful for carrying around with you and you can set it on your lap. That is why you call it a laptop! <br /><br />Most families have a laptop or computer at home.Sometimes it is used for homework, playing games, spreadsheets, databases and even watching DVDs. As you can see, every member of the family, young or old can use the laptop for different things. <br /><br />We like using the laptop for:<br /><br />watching TV programmes we have missed<br /><br />	playing games like Mine Sweeper and Pinball<br /><br />	getting information<br /><br />	sending emails to our friends<br /><br />These are just a few of the ways! :-)<br /><br />The iPhone is the thinnest phone at this point in time. It can be used as a normal phone.To work it, you simply touch the screen. It has apps, which are applications for different items eg, games, radio stations or supermarkets. On the iPhone you can text: texting is a way to communicate with others who may have a mobile phone instead of ringing them. The iPhone is a very useful object and is very popular if you can afford it. The iPhone can connect you to the internet, YouTube and facebook. It also has a camera and has a built in iPod. The iPhone 3G 8GB is worth £428 and the iPhone 4 16GB is worth £510.<br /><br />How expensive is that!!!!<br /><br />1986<br /><br />There were no DVD players, only video players. They were big and chunky and only played video cassettes. It was used for watching videos and producing entertainment. It was an electrical wired device.<br /><br />Nowadays we have Blu ray player- they play DVDs and Blu ray discs in high definition. They are very high tech but are very easy to use and also like the Video player it produces entertainment. One wire to plug in to the wall and one wire to plug into the television. <br /><br />An iPOd is a device that you can listen to music on. In 1986 they used tapes instead of iPods. It's easy to download music and apps from iTunes.<br /><br />iPods have apps which is short for applications. Apps are games, shopping catalogues, information sites and much more. Tapes were put into tape recorders but now we have hand held iPods.<br /><br />A HD plasma television is a screen you can watch. There are a lot of programs on it to watch. HD stands for High Definition which means better quality picture. Many people now have flat screens. Most plasma televisions can be put up on the wall.<br /><br />In the 1980's the televisions were bulky and small.

Usually I would dander into the kitchen, still half asleep. First of all I would feed my dog, Maisey, her breakfast which she wolfs down in no time. Now it's about 7:25am and it's time to make my breakfast. I have Coco Shreddies which are shredded wheat squares coated in chocolate. Once I've finished, I get dressed while listening to music on my iPod. Usually I have some spare time until I go to school so I watch one of the many channels on my flatscreen T.V. in my living room.<br /><br />Today it was sunny and warm so I walked to school because I don't live that far away from it. When I arrive at school, I sit down and copy down my homework for the day off the interactive whiteboard. In the morning, when everyone has settled down, we do our daily spellings and tables. We do Numeracy until break time. For break we eat healthily so I have an orange. Oranges are my favourite fruit. After break we do Literacy and sometimes we do a set of mental maths which I quite enjoy. Now it's lunch so we all get out our lunchboxes. I normally have ham and cheese sandwiches and a biscuit. Before I started, I changed my library book. We no longer have school dinners so everybody takes a packed lunch. When everybody goes outside we all play British Bulldogs except our version is different. We all run up and down the playground and if you get caught, you help the other person to catch people and at the end the person who hasn't been caught wins. The bell rings and everyone lines up and we wait until Miss Morrow, the Principal and P6/7 teacher, comes back from her lunch. We work and when we are finished we are allowed on the laptops.<br /><br />At the end of school, I walk back home with my dad and my dog. When I get home, I change out of my school uniform and into my normal clothes (usually skinny jeans.) I go outside with Maisey and throw a tennis ball for her. Then, if it's too warm to stay inside, I play on my dad's laptop outside. When evening comes I stay up for a while and then I put on my Sponge-Bob (a cartoon character) pyjamas and I go to bed at about 9:00pm or 9:20pm. I read a book until I fall asleep.<br /> <br />Lyn Morrow",Mounthill,County Antrim,Mid and East Antrim,Northern Ireland

When {Ulster Linen}was a great industry,{flax}was grown locally. After pulling, the flax plants were{""retted""}in dams, to break up the coating. After rett- ing, the flax was taken for{scutching. The scutchers stood in a row of little ""sentry boxes"" feeding the flax into{ {rollers}which broke away the {husks, leaving the fibres or{tow.}The job was hard, in the choking, dusty atmos- phere. The scutchers' favourite drinkwas metholated spirits. Sadly, littleflax is now grown, but a revival ofworld interest in Irish Linen maybring it back as a crop. Then Harvey's Scutch Mill may re-awaken to the rushof water, the whirr of belts, and thegrinding of rollers, cleaning thelinen fibres. ",Mounthill,County Antrim,Mid and East Antrim,Northern Ireland

You can see thehistory of the farm in the buildings because when the farmer built a newhome, he sited it beside the old one which he left standing to use as anouthouse. Therefore one will often find a small cottage built of thelocal{""black stone"",}standing beside a larger two-storey house of the samematerial, no longer used as a home,and finally a modern bungalow. Traditionally all the buildings were white-washed which made them water-proof as well as brightening them. This was usually done in spring. Old farmhouses often have many layers of whitewash. Most old farms had theirown kiln,to burn the local{limestone. ",Mounthill,County Antrim,Mid and East Antrim,Northern Ireland

The Bay is completely tidal (full at high tide, empty at low)except for the courses of the tworivers which flow out through the main channel. The Blackstaff River enters the Inner Bay from the North and the Carrigs enters from the South. Bothrivers follow a meandering and constantly shifting course through the mud and silt flats of the Bay. At lowtide the bay provides a large feedingarea for waders and wildfowl.

It is used for pasture, potatoes, andoccasionally barley or oats. The relationship between the farmer andthe managers of the Nature Reserve has been a close one with the farmer being very sympathetic to the ideals ofnature conservation. This has meantthat he has avoided such activities as spraying fields close to the Reserve,using pesticides or herbicides where these might affect Reserve wildlife, letting any chemicals get into the water supply,etc. The change ofownership of the farm this past year has caused the Reserve managersconcern lest the new owner might beless enlightened.

For thisreason, much of the management of theReserve serves to channel people inorder to restrict damage to a smallarea. A major headache for the Wardens is the increasing use of small, off- the-road, scrambles bikes and wide-tyred dune bikes. These are difficultto catch and can do considerable damage. Horse-riding is permittedalong certain paths, although this isby permit only. Further, almostuncontrollable damage is done to the seaward face of the dunes by picnickers burrowing into the sand toavoid the wind.

The shingleridges are fossil storm beach ridges and the dunes seem to be of two main phases. The older lower (20m high) landward dunes are the more stable,with some having been reclaimed as farmland. These older dunes support an acid heathland vegetation includingHeathers, Burnet Rose, Marram Grass, Bramble, Gorse, various Bents, Lady'sBedstraw, Violas, Sedges, Cladonia spp. and various Mosses. The scrub and woodland areas include pines,deciduous species such as sycamore and elder. Sea Buckthorn was introducedand has become a nuisance but recent clearing has been successful in smallareas.

They form a main duneridge down the centre of the Reserve with an active foredune ridge (12m to15m high) to the seaward side. These dunes are less stable than the older ones inland. Typical vegetationincludes Marram Grass, Sea Buckthorn,Thistles, Sea Spurge, Fescues, Violas, Thyme, Scabious, Storksbill, Plantains, Scarlet Pimpernel and various fungi, lichens and mosses. Shingle flats produced by wind erosion of the overlying sand are often lichen covered with Stonecrop and PortlandSpurge. Some of the lichens become large (e.g. Dog lichen over 30cm indiameter).

As the Reserve is managed as a SandDune System, it may be necessary inthe near future to 'damage' some areas in order to encourage these plants and maintain the youthful end of the succession. This year has seen the start of a program to introduce more rabbits in an attempt to encourage the plant communities characterised by short rabbit-cropped turf.
